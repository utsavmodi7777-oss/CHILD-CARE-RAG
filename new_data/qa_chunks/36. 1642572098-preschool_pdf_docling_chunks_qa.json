The rate of maturation, development and the pace of learning is greater during these years than at any subsequent period in the child's life. It is globally recognized that the period of first eight years from the birth are important for human development. Research from neuro sciences has highlighted that this is the stage for rapid  and extensive brain development. Environmental  conditions  during  early  years  substantially  affect  the  growth  of  children's neural  pathways.  Providing  optimal  stimulation  at  the  right  time  is  the  key  to  the networking of brain cells which shape the way individuals behave, think and learn for the rest of their lives.\nYoung children enter  preschool with a lot of curiosity and are attracted towards learning experiences  that  are  engaging  and  pleasurable.  It  is  an  important  time  in  children's  life because it is when they first learn how to interact with others including peers, teachers and parents. The research evidence supports the contention that better quality of preschool is related to better cognitive and social development of children. It is important for preschool teacher  to  engage  children  in  play  based  and  problem  solving  activities  to  develop  their creative and critical thinking skills.\nThe  introduction  of  Preschool  Curriculum  is  an  endeavour  by  Education  Department  and State Council of Educational Research and Training, UT Chandigarh to help the teachers to impart quality preschool education to children and bring about a uniformity in the teaching learning process in the schools of UT Chandigarh. The curriculum has been framed primarily from  two  documents  of  NCERT  namely  'The  Preschool  Curriculum'  and  'Guidelines  for Preschool  Education'  and  is  designed  for  two  years  of  Preschool  i.e.  Preschool-I  and Preschool-II.  The  pedagogical  and  transactional  processes  suggested  in  the  curriculum include  engaging  and  enjoyable  play  activities  and  learning  experiences  that  help  in  the holistic development of child."

The  early  years  are  the  most  significant  years  for  human growth,  development  and  learning  of  all  children  including  those  with  special  needs  due  to disability  conditions.  Environmental  conditions  during  early  years  substantially  affect  the growth of children's neural pathways. Providing optimal stimulation at the right time is the key to the networking for the rest of their lives.\nThe all-round capacities that emerge in 3 to 6 years age group are the pre-requisites for later success  in  school  and  life.  Through  creative  play,  well  thought  out  games  with  suitable adaptation for children with special working memory, focus their attention and acquire selfcontrol.\nIt  is  also  important  that  children  should  be  provided  emotionally  supportive  and  enabling environment to develop safe and secure relationship with teachers."

    "context_enriched_content": "Attributes of Preschool Children\nAt the preschool stage, children are curious and excited about the colours, shapes, sounds, sizes and forms around them. The child's ability to experience the world gets richer and more differentiated over the years. This early learning takes place as a part of communication with adults and peers in which language also plays a very important role. Children need to be given opportunities to investigate, explore, and develop an understanding of their immediate and wider  environment-  human,  society  and  cultural.  In  the  exploration  of  their  environments, children are involved in observation, questioning, discussion, investigation, prediction, analysis  and  experimentation.  In  this  process  they  construct,  modify,  and  develop  a  broad range of concepts and ideas. Children begin to handle their own feelings and emotions, learn\nsharing, turn taking and cooperating with peers. Children begin to tell others when they are happy or sad. They also develop their self-concept.\nThe present curriculum, therefore, includes the specific content and pedagogy to suit the age and  developmental  requirements  of  this  stage  and  finds  its  base  from  the  theoretical  and conceptual  frameworks  in  the  form  of  the  guiding  principles.  This  not  only  provides  the required  flexibility  in  terms  of  age,  given  the  diversity  in  policies,  but  also  caters  to  the realities of multilevel; multi age classrooms and ensures a smoother transition from preschool to early primary classes leading to positive self-concept and confidence, better performance and better retention rates."

    "context_enriched_content": "Handle Variation in Learning\nIn a class where children vary in their learning abilities and learning style the teacher must:\n-  moderate the learning environment for meeting varied learning needs of the children.\n-  focus on what children need to learn or how they will get access to the information.\n-  design activities in which the child engages to make sense of or acquire the content.\n-  culminate projects that enable the children to rehearse, apply, and extend what they have learnt in a topic.\n-  allow  children  to  work  in  different  groups-sometimes  with  children  at  same  level  of readiness or with mixed-readiness groups, with children having similar interests or with children  having  different  interests,  with  peers  who  learn  as  they  do,  or  randomly,  and often with the class as a whole.\n-  divide the whole group into two groups of children with varying abilities and ages. While the  younger  age  group  of  children  with  emerging  abilities  is  engaged  in  free  play,  the teacher conducts the guided activities with the older age group of children with higher abilities.  After  a  period  of  30  minutes  the  teacher  can  conduct  guided  activities  for  the younger age group of children with emerging ability while the older age group of children are engaged in free play. Thus the teacher will be able to manage the varying abilities and age groups through developmentally appropriate activities."

In  such heterogeneous  groups,  children  learn  from  each  other  and  thus,  facilitate  cooperative learning  skills.  Therefore,  a  class  of  multi-age  group  children  may  be  managed  to  get maximum  benefits  from  them  and  for  them.  For  handling  multi-level  learners,  who  have variations in their learning levels 'differentiation' may be followed to manage multi-age group children.\n-  The  teacher  must  start  with  moderating  the  learning  environment  for  meeting  varied learning needs of the children.\n-  Then she should focus on what children need to learn or how they will get access to the information.\n-  Further, she should design activities in which the child engages in order to make sense of or master the content.\nShe should also culminate projects that enable the  children  to  rehearse, apply, and extend what they have learned in a topic."

The medium of interaction in a preschool class should  be  mother  tongue.  When  the  child  is  comfortable  and  proficient  with  the  mother tongue,  it  supports  developing  proficiency  in  second  language  later.

It  also  reduces  the expenses by minimizing the need for special education services. Early intervention includes a system of services tailored to individual needs, that aim to help children directly and also through  providing  support  to  their  parents.  Early  intervention  can  be  offered  in  several forms:\n-  Speech and language therapy and using hearing aids can help in improving hearing\n-  Physiotherapy can help in development of motor skills such as balance, sitting, crawling and walking.\n-  Development  and  work  therapy  can  help  develop  motor  skills  of  hands,  play  and development for self-care.\n-  Assistance technology equipment that a child may need.\nInclusion provides  an  opportunity  to  treat  children  with  disabilities  equally  and  focus  on their  abilities.  This  empowers  them  with  adequate  facilities,  infrastructure  and  personal support. Hence,\n-  Carry out the early developmental screening of all children and identify their strengths.\n-  Understand the significance of early identification and intervention.\n-  Make adjustments in the physical environment to ensure it is barrier-free.\n-  Make curriculum flexible and accessible to children with different impairments.\n-  Develop appropriate assessment and evaluation procedures.\n-  Build  capacity  and  empower  all  stakeholders  to  revisit  their  own  attitudes  and  work towards  changing  them,  if  required.  Gradually  encourage  them  to  use  positive terminology when working with children with disabilities.\n-  Use age-appropriate play and learning material.\n-  Sensitisation, orientation, training and counselling of parents and community should be done."

It  is  important  that children  are  provided  with  rich  experiences  through  play  and  activities  that  develop  critical thinking, problem solving and understanding about themselves which are age and developmentally appropriate. Ample opportunities should be provided to explore understand, experiment, experience and transform information into meaningful content and skills\nThis curriculum has been developed with an assumption based on empirical and theoretical understanding  that  children  are  generally  ready  for  preschool  by  the  age  of  3  years.  This curriculum  has  been  designed  in  a  progressive  manner  for  3  years  of  preschool  education before Class I,  between the  age  of 3-6  years. While there  is  a  broad universal  sequence  of development, yet,  there  are  differences  among children  in  terms  of  their  prior  experiences that children bring to preschool, their context and abilities. Typically, there is also a difference of about a year in the age of children in the same class, bringing in a lot of diversity into the classroom.  Therefore,  the  curriculum  should  be  transacted  with  adequate  flexibility  to accommodate  this  diversity  and  should  not  be  seen  as  rigidly  tied  down  to  a  particular chronological age of children. The curriculum needs to be  customized by the teacher at any given point of time for meeting diverse learning needs of any age group. Given the children's age and the fact that they are likely to be away from home for the first time, considerable time may be allotted for free play to develop a sense of liking for the new environment and people. This will form the basis for gradually moving them on to more structured activities.\n- . The present curriculum covers the three broad goals, key skills and concepts to be developed, pedagogical  processes  to  be  used  by  the  teachers  and  the  early  learning  outcomes  to  be achieved by the children at the end of Preschool I and Preschool II.\nEarly  learning  outcomes  are  the  expectations  for  the  learning  and  development  of  young children, in other words what children should know and be able to do at the end of each year. Teachers need to align content, pedagogy, activities, experiences and opportunities for play, exploration, discovery, and problem-solving in order to help child achieve holistic development through the following three broad goals.\n- Goal 1: Children maintain good health and wellbeing.\n- Goal 2: Children become effective communicators.\n- Goal 3: Children become involved learners and connect with their immediate environment.\nEarly learning out  comes  should  be  observed  and  assessed  in  a  continuous  and  a comprehensive manner so as to provide scope for improvement."

It attempts to tie  in  various  skills  and  knowledge  to  be  acquired  by  children,  into  a  coherent  whole organized around a specific theme, such as myself, plants, animals, fruits, vegetables, etc. A deliberate focus on a given topic enables young children to be more efficient in acquiring skills and processes required to gather and process information in later life.\nWhen we take a particular theme, and help children to actively and visibly build knowledge on that theme, we enable children to acquired skills to make learning more efficient in the future.  To  plan  the  content  following  a  thematic  approach,  each  theme  could  be  spread over about 1-2 months, with sub themes that covers a smaller period such as week or two weeks so that the information surrounding a large unit  is organised  in a  way that  makes sense to the children. Theme teaching is generally carried out according to a detailed pre designed lesson plan. Such an approach is largely teacher directed with very limited scope to allow for child initiated learning."

In this approach stimulating materials  and  activities  are  made available by the teacher and children self-select activities according to their interest at each point  of  time  and  learn  at  their own  pace.  The  teacher's  role  is that  of  a  facilitator  and  she  does not carry out any specific structured    activities.    Play\nstimulates curiosity and exploration and leads to mastery of body controls and encourages creativity and social skills and develops emotional balance and language skills."

The  sensory  experience and action make  the learning better and  more impactful. This leads to an exciting journey of discovery  and  enhanced  understanding.  A  preschool teacher embeds the learning goals in various types of activities such as outdoor and indoor play, storytelling,  art  and  music  activities,  organized  in  a preschool class."

The teacher  offers  some  open-ended  triggers  and  then  observes  the  children,  listen  to  their stories, their questions, see how they navigate the activity, take note of their interest levels and  talk  with  the  children.  Children  decide  what  they  want  to  know  more  about  and investigate further.\nThen  with  the  variety  of  materials  on  offer  to  the  children,  the  teachers  encourage children's engagement in activities, to go deeper and deeper to find the answers to their questions,  and  in  turn,  ask  new  questions  to  help  them  to  make  their  learning  visible through modeling or building, collage or drawing, dramatic play or music; any means at all. These  activities  are  not  pre-planned/designed.  They  are  subtly  suggested  to  the  children and the discoveries from one experience lead onto the next. A project may not constitute the whole day's schedule. Teachers may allocate half a day for the project and plan activities for the remaining half."

    "context_enriched_content": "Assessment Tools and Techniques\nAssessment can be done by using various tools and techniques:\n-  Anecdotal Records: Brief written notes based on observations of children-how and where children spend time, their social relationships, their use of language, modes of interaction, information about health and nutrition habits.\n-  Portfolios: A portfolio is  a  flexible  and  adaptable  collection  over  time of  various  concrete work samples showing many dimensions of the child's learning. This type of assessment also focuses  on  the  child's  strengths  and  demonstrations  of  knowledge  and  skills. Samples  of Children's Work in art, painting, craft work, college making etc. also become a part of the portfolio.\n-  Observation: Observation could be planned purposefully for observing a child or group of children in specific situation. It is also carried out as an on-going natural process in every day teaching learning activities. Observation carried out scientifically is source of valid information about child's various personality dimensions and learning progress.\n-  Checklist: Checklist  is  a  list  of  learning  outcomes,  behaviours  or  traits  of  a  child  in  a particular development area. A teacher is to determine whether these traits exits in a child or not. She has to mark on the checklist as 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate whether a particular child exhibited a behaviour during that observational period.\n-  Rating Scale: A rating scale is a tool used for assessing the performance of tasks, skill levels, procedures,  processes,  qualities,  quantities,  or  end  product.  Rating  scales  are  similar  to checklists except that they indicate the degree of accomplishment rather than just yes or no.\n-  Photographs and Video Clips: Videos and audio help teachers to assess the child's progress and program progress and boost the motivation and confidence of children. Teachers can accordingly design and modify suitable classroom practices by viewing and listening to the recordings subject to privacy considerations.\nTeacher must document each child's learning in a variety of ways. The documentation will provide administration and the teaching staff with valid information on how to improve the programme and incorporate necessary changes. Each child's folder should be available for parents and children to view and should remain with the preschool until such time as a child's transition to another preschool programme in the primary school."

Pre-schools and early primary grades constitute the foundational stage for education. Children between 3-8 years age  group  show  developmental  continuities  therefore  there  is  a  need  to  have  upward linkages  in  curriculum,  pedagogy  and  the  learning  outcomes.  In  this  context  it  becomes imperative  that  all  children  including  those  with  special  needs  are  supported  in  the transition process from home to preschool and preschool to primary school.\nThere are four major areas where children may experience the lack of continuity which may hinder their learning i.e.\n- i. Change in the physical environment\n- ii. Difference in classroom organization\n- iii. Content curriculum\n- iv. Pedagogy and practices of preschool and early primary classes"
