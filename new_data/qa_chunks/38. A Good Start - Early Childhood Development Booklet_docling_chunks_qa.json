    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction\nWorld vision is a child-focused organisation and is committed to working with partners for the sustained well-being of children within their families and communities, especially the most vulnerable.  children are most vulnerable during their early years. malnutrition has a long-term impact on young children's development, and diseases and accidents maim and claim the most lives during the early years.\nOften the perception of early childhood Development (ecD) is the construction of preschools for 3- to 5-year-old children. ecD is much more than this. a focus on ecD ensures that children are healthy and well nourished, have bonded to their primary caregiver(s), are able to interact and communicate well with others and are ready to start school.  a focus on ecD lays the foundation for successful development.\nyoung children spend most of their time with their families, so it is important to support those families who are their main caregivers. Strengthening families will improve the health, safety and general well-being of young children in the long term.\necD addresses the holistic needs of young children from conception to eight years old. 1 care of pregnant women is important. Women who are healthy, well nourished and in supportive relationships bear healthier children, giving them a good start to life.  The first two years of life are the peak period for brain growth; therefore it is vital to provide families with information about how to stimulate their children and provide physical and emotional care. Supporting caregivers (families and teachers) in nurturing the emotional, spiritual and social needs of young children throughout this period is critical.\necD programming includes a focus on providing a safe environment for children in both preschool and the home environment.  also, appropriate learning environments at home, in the community, and in preschool provide young children with a good foundation for learning and transition to school.\nthis booklet has been designed to assist World  vision staff and communities as well as sponsors in supporting countries to be more aware of the needs and rights of young children. t ogether, we can contribute in supporting children to develop to their full potential."

    "context_enriched_content": "Why are the early years so critical?\n- n early childhood is a time of special importance in terms of the cognitive, physical, emotional spiritual, and social development affecting a child's overall well-being. early childhood development provides a foundation for healthier and better educated nations.\n- n these years are marked by extremely rapid development of the brain and other key biological and psychosocial systems.  the young child's optimal development depends on a nurturing and stimulating physical and social environment.\n- n What children experience before they turn five years old affects later stages of development. For example, many adult physical and mental health problems have their roots in the early years. t o improve the health, the prosperity and the quality of life of their populations, it is critical for societies to invest in their children's early development. 2\n- n experiences in early childhood shape a child's ability to read, write and become a confident, competent person. Each aspect of development (cognitive, physical, social, emotional and spiritual) is dependent on the others. For example, a child's level of nutrition (physical development) before starting school affects how well a child learns (cognitive development) once the child is in school.\n2 Nadeau, S., kataoka, N.,  valerio, a., Neuman, m., and elder, L. (2010) Investing in  Young Children: An ECD Guide for Policy Dialogue and Project Preparation .

    "context_enriched_content": "Child rights in early childhood\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in 1989, firmly established child-specific needs and rights. It requires that states act in the best interests of the child. For the first time in many societies, children, including the very young, are to be respected as persons in their own right.  y oung children should be recognized as active members of families, communities and societies, with their own needs, interests and opinions.\nmany agencies and governments acknowledge the critical role of ecD as a human and economic investment with a high return to society. this marks a shift away from beliefs that regard early childhood mainly as a period when a young child automatically grows with minimal interventions until reaching the more 'valued' stages of attending school and reaching adulthood.\nTo fulfil their rights, young children have particular requirements for physical nurture, emotional care and sensitive guidance, as well as time and space for social play, exploration and learning.   they need to be registered at birth and enjoy loving parents or caregivers who protect them and provide for all their needs. communities need to organize to promote children's well-being and hold governments to account for the provision of essential services and social protection entitlements for their children.\na child rights framework is an important tool for guiding ecD policy, planning and establishing monitoring frameworks and assessing progress in meeting obligations to young children at different levels - family, community, local institutions, district, provincial, national and international.\nThe years between conception and eight years old are the foundations for future success in a child's life."

    "context_enriched_content": "How do young children develop?\n- n before building a permanent house it is necessary to lay the foundation to support the entire structure - we do not begin building a house at the second floor. Before a child enters primary school, a similar foundation must be laid.\n- n Change and growth occur more rapidly in the first five years of life than at any other time in a child's life.\n- n children's skills for moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with adults, peers and their environment develop rapidly during these first five years of life.\n- n children learn from birth, and in the early years children acquire the fundamental skills that are critical to the success of their future education and indeed the rest of their lives.\n- n Within their families and communities, young children need to be supported in the development of physical, mental, spiritual, emotional and social abilities that will enable them to thrive.\n- n Understanding how a child develops and why the early years of a child's life are important is critical for understanding the concept of ecD.\n- n On the next page are two figures: Figure 1 shows the stages of brain development from three weeks of age in the womb to newborn at birth.\nThe best way to encourage brain development is to provide young children with continual positive interaction with people and things and to ensure good nutrition."

    "context_enriched_content": "How does a young child's brain grow and develop?\n- n brain growth begins during pregnancy, with the most rapid period of growth taking place during the first five years of life - the first two years being the most critical.\n- n at birth the brain already contains most of its billions of cells. During the first two years of life these cells become organised into systems for thinking, remembering and feeling.\n- n brain cells link to a complex message system.  as things are seen, heard, felt or tasted, messages are sent from one brain cell to another.  these messages activate the cells, enabling them to make connections with the cells around them, causing the brain to grow.  the brain needs to be stimulated from birth with colours, shapes, forms, sounds and movements for the connections to be made.\n- n The quality of experiences provided for children in the first five years lays the foundation for later learning and social skills.\n- n If babies and young children are not well nourished, stimulated and loved, brain abnormalities can occur that cause developmental delays in cognitive and emotional functioning.\n- n how the brain develops not only impacts a child's ability to learn but also affects physical, social and emotional development. brain development in the early years is one of the key reasons for investing in programmes for very young children."
