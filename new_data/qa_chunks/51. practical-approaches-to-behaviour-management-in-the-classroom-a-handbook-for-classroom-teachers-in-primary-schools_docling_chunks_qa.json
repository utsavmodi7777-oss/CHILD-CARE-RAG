    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction\nPromoting effective learning and teaching is paramount to the Welsh Government's agenda. Key to achieving effective learning and teaching is ensuring that class teachers have the necessary skills to approach their teaching in ways that reduce the likelihood of children misbehaving. Teachers also need to be equipped with effective skills and responses for those instances where difficult behaviour does occur.\nWhere teachers have good preventative and responsive skills the likelihood of difficulties emerging or developing into incidents will be markedly reduced.\nThis handbook is intended as a resource to enhance the practice of teachers at primary level, primarily for newly qualified teachers (NQTs), although others may also find something of interest in it.\nThe handbook focuses on general behaviour management methods and does not specifically cover issues relating to special educational needs (SEN)."

There are five basic models in understanding child behaviour.\nThese include:\n- biological\n- behavioural\n- cognitive\n- systemic\n- psychodynamic."

    "context_enriched_content": "Biological\nChildren have a tendency to interact with the environmental influences around them and this interaction informs their behaviour. Research evidence has come from studies around twins separated at birth and early infancy. This goes to show that both nature and nurture are involved in our development, although when dealing with behaviour attention needs to be paid to creating a positive environment and experiences to promote good behaviour."

    "context_enriched_content": "Behavioural\nBehaviour can be modified through 'conditioning'. This is achieved by another event following an action. There are two types of 'conditioning'.\nClassical conditioning - a behaviour is connected with a certain stimulus, for example a child feels happy and excited on a Friday afternoon as this is the time the whole class has 'Fun Friday'.\nOperant conditioning - a behaviour is connected and repeated by rewarding the positive behaviour and issuing sanctions for the negative behaviour."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive\nThe cognitive approach helps the child judge and reason effectively and have a perception of their surroundings. This means that the way in which we behave is influenced by our thinking.\nThe cortex is the conscious, rational-thinking part of the brain and determines the child's response to certain situations. Research has shown that if an infant is constantly being subjected to negative situations, for example experiencing domestic violence and/or neglect, then the connections that form the cortex to help deal with situations in a rational way are limited. In situations such as this the child is left to rely on the limbic system which is the body's alarm system. So when a child is faced with a mild situation, for example the person sitting next to them takes their pencil without asking, instead of the rational-thinking cortex being engaged the limbic system is triggered displaying the flight/fight reaction."

    "context_enriched_content": "Systemic\nThe systemic approach looks at targeting the individual's behaviour within the system. These systems can include:\n- their family\n- their friends\n- their school\n- their classmates\n- their community\n- their outside school clubs, e.g. Scouts.\nThe quality of these systems is a great influence on the child's behaviour. For example, a child living in a family where domestic violence takes place will naturally struggle within another system, i.e. school. The behaviour the child experiences at home, for example shouting, violence and/or aggressiveness, will not work in a school context which can cause problems for the child. In situations such as this, working with the family to understand the environment in which the child lives is paramount in finding solutions to help their behaviour."

Teaching a number of children with different needs, behaviours and attention spans can be challenging. However, when a positive learning culture is created, the children will learn better because they will know what is expected of them."

Ask each child to enter one at a time, informing them of the set task.\nIt is highly likely that one or two (or maybe more) children will 'test' boundaries, and will not enter the classroom in the desired way, e.g. they may start talking or shouting out, trying to jump the queue, etc. If this happens, very promptly and assertively inform the child 'You're not ready to come into our classroom…please wait there until you are ready to come in' (direct the child to wait outside the classroom in clear view of the teacher).\nWhen all the children have entered the classroom and they are engaged on the set task, praise and reward the desired behaviour. This way the children are more motivated to carry out the task in order to receive the reward.\nReturn to the child whom you have asked to wait outside the classroom and ask them if they are ready to come into the classroom. It is highly likely that the child will now be ready and will enter the classroom in a calm and focused manner. If the child is not ready, then give them a further few minutes (ensuring they are in clear view of the teacher) then return to them and repeat the process."

It is a comprehensive programme for promoting emotional and social competencies and reducing aggression and behaviour problems while simultaneously enhancing the educational process in the classroom. This innovative curriculum is designed to be used in a multi-year, universal prevention model. Although primarily focused on the school and classroom settings, information and activities are also included for use with parents/carers.\nPATHS has been field-tested and researched with children in mainstream classroom settings, as well as with a variety of children with additional learning needs. The PATHS Curriculum, taught three times per week for a minimum of 20-30 minutes per day, provides teachers with systematic, developmental-based lessons, materials, and instructions for teaching their students emotional literacy, self-control, social competence, positive peer relations, and interpersonal problemsolving skills. A key objective of promoting these developmental skills is to prevent or reduce behavioural and emotional problems. PATHS lessons include instruction in:\n- identifying and labelling feelings\n- expressing feelings\n- assessing the intensity of feelings\n- managing feelings\n- understanding the difference between feelings and behaviours\n- delaying gratification\n- controlling impulses\n- reducing stress\n- self-talk\n- reading and interpreting social cues\n- understanding the perspectives of others\n- using steps for problem solving and decision making\n- having a positive attitude toward life\n- self-awareness\n- non-verbal communication skills\n- verbal communication skills.\nTeachers receive training in a two- to three-day workshop and in biweekly meetings with the curriculum consultant.\nThe PATHS Curriculum has been shown to improve protective factors and reduce behavioural risk factors. Compared to a control group, evaluations have demonstrated significant improvements for children on the programme in the following areas:\n- improved self-control\n- improved understanding and recognition of emotions\n- increased ability to tolerate frustration\n- use of more effective conflict-resolution strategies\n- improved thinking and planning skills\n- decreased anxiety/depressive symptoms (teacher report of special needs students)\n- decreased conduct problems (teacher report of special needs students)\n- decreased symptoms of sadness and depression (child report special needs)\n- decreased report of conduct problems, including aggression (child report)."

It is essential to start with a new class in the right way by building positive and respectful relationships from the outset.\nOver time, a teacher must build up trust and 'friendship' with the children as this establishes the basis for behavioural management and change.\nFundamental to success is building strong relationships with the children thereby creating a caring, loyal and respectful bond. This forms a strong foundation from which behavioural change can take place. Through displaying acceptance and care for all the children in the class, the children will gain respect from their teacher.\nThere are a number of ways to build a strong and respectful relationship with the class. These include the following.\n- Be a positive role model for the children; for them to be respectful to others they must be treated with respect.\n- Create a caring, relaxed, supportive and fair environment where each child feels accepted and that they belong.\n- Recognise every child's strengths and believe that every child has the ability to learn (especially children with SEN and disabilities).\n- Acknowledge, reinforce and share all successes with the class.\n- Involve the children in making decisions regarding rules and activities within the classroom. This helps them to 'own' their own rules.\n- Take time to speak to each child individually to find out about their interests, talents, goals, likes and dislikes.\n- Discuss classroom rules and consequences so that all children understand clearly what is expected of them.\n- When using reprimands, never embarrass or ridicule the children.\n- Interact with the children during playtime (e.g. joining in a game of football or hopscotch) or by just having a chat. Children naturally enjoy this kind of interaction and it helps to give them confidence. You are also showing that you have a legitimate 'care' for their needs."

You can have a lot of fun by engaging the class with some of their answers, e.g. who said their favourite food was black pudding? Whose favourite sport is snooker? Who owns a pet snake? Whose favourite television programme is Gardening Time ?\nThrough remembering their responses (why not keep them in your desk drawers?) you can have a conversation with the children at the start of the day, in playtime, after the weekend, at the start of a new term, etc. For example, 'How is your pet snake, Holly?', 'I see Manchester United lost again, Alex', 'JLS are number one in the charts, Sarah', 'Has your cat had her kittens yet, Alisha?'\nChildren like to know that you as a teacher have an interest in them as a person and not just as a learner.

For a classroom teacher, finding time to talk to an individual child while at the same time managing a classroom situation can be difficult. Using your classroom assistant or learning school mentor appropriately can be helpful here, in the same way as it is when 'testing' individual children in their attainment targets.\nParticular care should be taken about how and where to talk to a child when the issue is either confidential or disciplinary. It is important that this conversation remains private.\nEqually, it is particularly important how a new child to the class is introduced and what is said. This requires some careful thought and preselection of wording.\nTeachers can also learn a great deal about children through individual reading sessions. Often, these may reflect a child's moods or concerns at the time.\nSuccessful teachers need to be good listeners and have active listening skills. This usually means listening with individual attention, remembering what is said (including the details) and noting the children's feelings during the discussion.\nGood teachers also have to be able to listen to themselves, accept pauses and silences, remain relaxed and in control both in class discussions and with individual children. Teachers need to acquire appropriate skills in responding to what children say. This can be achieved by asking the right questions, by paraphrasing, summarising or reflecting back. Learning to ask the right questions often comes with experience."

Sometimes it is appropriate to 'praise' a child in a one-to-one situation. Sometimes, it is better in whole-class situations. It depends what you are praising the child (and/or whole class) for. Is it for good work? Is it for an out-of-school activity? Is it for scoring three goals in a school football match or for playing the piano well in assembly?\nThe selective use of praise with children is one of the best and most effective weapons in a teacher's armoury. Properly used and appropriately applied, it can make individual children and whole groups or classes feel very good about themselves. As such, it is utilising positive reinforcement in the best possible manner.\nConversely, it is wrong to 'label' children inappropriately, especially in front of classmates. For example, calling a child a 'hooligan' is likely to mean:\n- the child is more likely to behave like a 'hooligan' in the future\n- it becomes a term of ridicule within the class and it can even 'backfire' on the teacher who has used it."

If so, engage in discussion with them about their brother(s) or sister(s). Just as you as a teacher have a life outside the school, so the children also have their lives as part of family and community groups. Their outside-school lives are exceedingly important to them and should always be respected.\nEqually, the use of light, temperature, colours and display features can be important to both a child's mood and learning. The use of displays within the classroom is an important part of its organisation. The use of displays not only reflects the curriculum but it also presents children's achievements. Good displays can be utilised as:\n- a curriculum resource\n- as a prompt or reminder for children\n- as a celebration of individual child achievement\n- as evidence to others of the work done by the class (e.g. other children, parents/carers, the headteacher, local authority staff, Estyn, visitors, etc.).\nThrough visibly displaying their work, teachers signal that they value children's efforts and are giving recognition of their achievements.

It is important that practitioners create a positive environment where clear expectations are understood by the children, parents/carers and staff.\nChildren require a wide range of experiences both to support their personal, social and emotional development, and to help them make sense of their own immediate world and the wider world around them.\nSocial development is a key part of the Foundation Phase and focuses on children's social interactions and relationships with their peers and adults. Children should develop an understanding of the behavioural expectations of the setting/school and understand that rules are essential to develop an understanding of what is fair and unfair and to be willing to compromise. Practitioners could involve children in the decision-making process enhancing their understanding of such rules/expectations\nEmotional development focuses on the variety of feelings and emotions that children develop and their ability to express them to others. As they progress, children should be helped to develop coping strategies to understand and control their emotions, for example being able to manage change in routine and in the way they use materials. Practitioners should also be aware that some children will need to be taught how to develop coping strategies through story-making and role modelling.\nPlay provides opportunities for children to learn through imitation, imagination and fun and to learn about experiencing the consequences of their actions. There will, however, be occasions when practitioners will need to provide the scaffolding and opportunities for children to acquire and develop the skills that enable them to:\n- pay attention when the practitioner signals for attention\n- respect one another\n- take turns, share and cooperate\n- ask questions/ask for help."

Instead the strategies need to be specific to the individual's needs.\nTo identify the behavioural needs of a child a problem-solving approach needs to be implemented. Formulating appropriate strategies requires an examination of the behaviour, which can be achieved by asking a series of specific questions. The answers help to understand the nature and causes of the behaviour and what it might mean for that particular child.\nThrough being aware of a child's antecedents to unacceptable behaviour it is possible to reduce or even avoid behavioural problems. This can be established through a problem-solving approach."

These strategies create a sound routine, clear expectations and coping strategies designed to reduce frustration and outbursts. The secret to successful proactive interventions is strategic planning otherwise teachers are put in a situation where they have to react to the behaviour problem. This unplanned reaction tends to be emotionally laden. It is always best to focus on increasing positive behaviours through praise and reinforcement instead of trying to reduce unwanted behaviours. Proactive behaviour management is the bedrock of good behaviour. However, reactive techniques are also necessary."

Children enjoy receiving attention for a variety of reasons. If certain children do not receive enough positive attention for their good behaviours, they will often resort to behaviour that results in negative forms of attention, for example making noises or calling out. Some would prefer to receive this negative attention than to do without attention altogether. Using both positive attention and ignoring at the right moments can be very effective. The child soon learns that positive behaviours result in positive attention and negative behaviours result in no attention.\nPossible reasons for attention seeking are listed below.\n- Lack of rules and boundaries.\n- No sense of belonging.\n- Low self-esteem.\n- A degree of immaturity."

For this strategy to work consistency is imperative.\n- Ignoring the behaviour can be a powerful strategy although it does have its drawbacks:\n-   the child's behaviour can escalate. This is because they are trying to receive the attention they are used to and are testing the new rules that have changed\n-   other children may repeatedly bring the behaviour to the teacher's attention\n-   the behaviour may become a risk to the health and safety of others.\n- If a child has displayed unwanted behaviour withhold attention for about 30 seconds, for example. After an unwanted behaviour, the child should exhibit at least 30 seconds of good behaviour before you provide them with positive attention.\n- 'Catch them being good' before things go wrong, for example 'Sam, well done, you've worked very hard.' Pay lots of attention when the child is behaving well and reward often.\n- Let the child know about the behaviour you like, for example 'Well done for putting up your hand to answer the question.' Make eye contact with the child; give a simple smile or nod of the head.\n- If necessary, implement the appropriate sanctions according to the school's behaviour policy. · Put more energy and attention into good behaviour than unwanted behaviour. Give attention immediately following the behaviour that you liked.\n•\nTry to provide positive attention at least once every five minutes.\n- If necessary, implement the appropriate sanctions according to the school's behaviour policy.\n- Devise a behaviour plan (see the 'Playground behaviour practical ideas' section, pages 84-88) with the child to help them take control of their own behaviour.\n- Make sure the child knows you care about them. Remember the child took a long time to develop this unwanted behaviour, so be consistent and patient as the behaviour takes time to change.\n- If the behaviour continues, a meeting with the parent(s)/carer(s) may be advisable to establish the cause of the behaviour."

It would be important to emphasise that together both teacher and child will work on raising his awareness of the behaviour and eradicating it through the use of a reward scheme.\n- The reward scheme to support this approach could be devised together with the child but a simple toy safe or similar could be placed on their table, which would ideally be near to the teacher, to ensure easy access to praise, reward and remind the child without doing so publicly across the classroom. Start the process using five-minute intervals, so if the child did not make a noise within five minutes place a token in the child's safe. Continue this for the duration of the lesson/day. At the end of the day the child should count their tokens and if they have received the pre-agreed number they will get the overall reward of free time, for example. Again, this reward could be decided with the child to give them ownership.\n- If, however, the child makes a noise within the five minutes the time must be decreased to three minutes in order to find an achievable target so the child has confidence in their ability to reach it. The time frame could then be increased as the child is succeeding, ideally in increments of five minutes, until the child completes a whole lesson/day without making a noise.\n- If necessary, implement the appropriate sanctions according to the school's behaviour policy.\n- Devise a behaviour plan (see 'The link between bullying and children ' s behaviour' section, pages 72-77) with the child to help them take control of their own behaviour.\n- Make sure the child knows you care about them.

Praise and acknowledge when the child makes the right choice and squeezes the ball.\n- By catching the child behaving well and providing immediate, positive feedback the aggressive behaviour will start to diminish.\n- Provide the child with a 'Quiet Time' card, which they can show when they feel angry. This card allows them 5-10 minutes of quiet time either within the classroom or within a partner classroom. When the child shows the card they are rewarded for making the right choice.\n- If necessary, implement the appropriate sanctions according to the school's behaviour policy.\n- Devise a behaviour plan (see 'The link between bullying and children's behaviour' section, pages 72-77) with the child to help them take control of their own behavior.\n- Make sure the child knows you care about them. Remember the child took a long time to develop this unwanted behaviour, so be consistent and patient as the behaviour takes time to change.\n- If the behaviour continues a meeting with the parent(s)/carer(s) may be advisable to establish the cause of the behaviour."

    "context_enriched_content": "Re-engaging individual children - some practical ideas\nSome children's behaviour may be so disruptive that they require additional attention and concerted support. Disruptive behaviour is easy to detect, however many children with emotional difficulties may turn inward and become withdrawn and not engaged with others. Their problems may only really become evident in their reduced socialisation and disengagement from their peers. Some children and young people lack the social skills to cope effectively within a classroom setting.\nThere are particular problems identifying those children who turn inward with their difficulties. As they are often not acting out their difficulties, they may go unnoticed unless all teachers in school are able to scan and screen for such difficulties. There is a need to ensure that appropriate attention is paid to this group of children who may not cause staff difficulties but who may be at significant risk of becoming 'lost' in the system."

    "context_enriched_content": "Background and research\nIn 1969, Marjorie Boxall, an educational psychologist for Inner London Education Authority, started nurture groups for children from stressful or disrupted backgrounds. She realised that most of these children were unable to make trusting relationships with adults or engage appropriately with other children because of inadequate early nurturing. Through providing a safe place in school she was able to create the right environment where these children could develop and grow.\nThere has been a lot of evidence to support nurture groups since they started in 1969. The main emphasis is based on Bowlby's attachment theory, the relationship between the child and the adult. This theory identifies the way that the quality of early experiences in a child's development affects behaviour. The therapy which nurture groups provide helps to reverse the damage caused through neglect or abuse.\nThe effectiveness of nurture groups was researched by Iszatt and Wasilewska (1997). They looked at two sets of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties: one set of children were placed in a nurture group, and one set in a mainstream school. The group who had not received the support of a nurture group were three times more likely to require formal assessment than those in the group that had, and seven times more likely to require special school provision."

    "context_enriched_content": "How nurture groups work\nWithin a nurture group there will be between 6-12 children with one teacher and one teaching assistant. Before a child is accepted into a nurture group assessments are given and a series of observations carried out. The parent(s)/carer(s) are encouraged to support the programme and consent is always obtained before the child starts the group.\nThe nurture group environment is a crucial factor in its success. It is designed to help the child feel cared for and safe. Children are encouraged and supported to help develop trusting relationships with adults. Over time the child's self-esteem, self-respect and a sense of well-being are increased, resulting in them feeling happier, more confident and more motivated to learn. The children also begin to learn to use effective social skills and adopt alternative strategies to use in difficult situations.\nThe nurturing atmosphere in the room is created by including a sofa and a cooking area. The cooking area is a fundamental part of the room as this is where the children have breakfast and snacks, and are encouraged to share through communication anything of interest or concern. This provides an excellent opportunity for social learning.\nTypically, the children register with their mainstream class and are collected and taken to the nurture group. The children reintegrate with the rest of the school during lunch and breaks."

The Boxall Profile can be used to help with this process. The Boxall Profile is a two-part checklist which provides an assessment framework for the child and an intervention plan for staff - it is completed by staff who know the child."

This policy should specify the sanctions and rewards available for staff to use to deter negative and promote positive behaviour. The policy must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure its effectiveness.\nSanctions are only effective when used in the context of a positive classroom culture, where there are clear rules and routines as well as the use of rewards to reinforce positive behaviour. They should be used sparingly to achieve a positive result and should not overburden the person imposing the sanction. When issuing sanctions to a child because of inappropriate behaviour, they should not be implemented in isolation. They must be paired with more positive responses and teaching of skills. Sanctions need to be timely, specific, logical, reasonable and fair, with a clear beginning and ending.\nIt is important that sanctions are:\n- understood by children, staff and parents/carers\n- fair\n- consistently applied according to the school's behaviour policy\n- a logical response to a behaviour\n- realistic to the misbehaviour displayed.\nSchools have a legal right if a child misbehaves to impose sanctions which are reasonable and proportional to the circumstances of the case. Schools should monitor the use of sanctions by age, ethnicity, gender, SEN and disability."

If they are too severe, delayed or inconsistent they will probably fail to work.\nUltimately, the headteacher (or the most senior teacher in the headteacher's absence) may choose to exclude a child from the school on a fixed-term or permanent basis. This, however, should only be taken as a last resort for very serious cases and, particularly in primary schools, should be used rarely. Further guidance on the exclusion process is available in Exclusion from Schools and Pupil Referral Units (Welsh Assembly Government, 2008)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Teaching social skills\nSanctions must not be issued in isolation. Instead they should be paired with more positive responses and teaching of social skills in order to promote behaviour change. The personal and social education (PSE) framework provides many opportunities for undertaking this work. Many schools in Wales also use approaches such as Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) and the Incredible Years.\nLearning social skills is an essential part of a child's education. Developing social skills can help individuals to make good choices, and decide how to behave in varied situations. An essential ingredient in creating and maintaining a positive school environment and reducing misbehaviour is the implementation of sound social skills.\nA child's behaviour, academic performance and their social relationships both in and out of school are influenced by their knowledge and understanding of social skills. It is clear that it is not only the family's responsibility to teach children important interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills, but that the school also has an important role to play. Working together to promote these skills both at home and at school benefits the child and also helps to create a strong home-school link.\nProviding a child with a full range of social skills gives them with the ability to make social choices. The benefits of social skills are:\n- creating a positive and safe school environment\n- helping children to overcome stressful situations\n- providing children with an ability to express emotions, e.g. anger, in an appropriate and safe way\n- learning to walk away from a situation and being able to request an adult's help\n- understanding how their actions can affect other people\n- taking personal responsibility for promoting a safe and positive school environment."

A child's misbehaviour often decreases over time when behaviour 'costs' a child, i.e. the focus should be on 'not gaining' as opposed to 'taking away'.\nIt is also important to note that taking away a longer-term reward (e.g. a trip to the pantomime) can sometimes worsen behaviour as the child will no longer have anything to work for. In situations like this the use of a strike chart may be more appropriate, for example if the child receives three strikes on the chart then the main reward is taken away. The use of strike charts usually gives a child up to three chances before being penalised. It is the child's choice whether to engage in positive or negative behaviour. There may be occasions, however, when main rewards may need to be changed if a child's behaviour is severe."

In order to keep the child focused and motivated, implement the 'Golden five minutes' rule. Here, within five minutes of the reprimand/sanction, find something to praise the child on. For example, sitting correctly, reading quietly, completing their work, putting their hand up to ask a question.

Eventually, the school contacted the education welfare officer who made a home visit. She spoke to Darren and his mother. It turned out that Darren was being repeatedly bullied both physically and verbally. He was often too afraid to go to school. Further investigations showed that he was also the subject of bullying on the school bus to and from school and in the yard during playtimes. His mother had taken him home to see her general practitioner twice following bouts of physical bullying. Darren believed that by reporting the boys who bullied him, he would be subjected to more serious bullying. His mother was also concerned about being victimised within the local community. The bullying started because Darren was smaller than his peers, overweight and not so good at sporting activities.\nAfter the intervention of the education welfare officer and the school taking appropriate action, the bullying stopped.

Sometimes parents or carers fail to understand the importance of regular attendance at school or the legal requirements placed upon them. Sometimes, parents/carers simply prefer to have their child at home for company or lack the motivation to ensure that they make it into school. These and other reasons are why it is important for schools to liaise with the education welfare service to ensure that a home visit and a detailed follow-up report are made.\nResearch also suggests that there are different 'types' of children who miss school for 'unauthorised' reasons. Some children are naturally shy or quiet. Some may have 'phobic' tendencies. Others may be disruptive children who are often in trouble at school.\nSome children will talk openly about their reasons for missing school. Others will not. Some will provide genuine reasons for missing school. Others will do the opposite. It is also for these reasons that advice from the local education welfare service is often advisable. Welsh Government policy requires schools to follow up on all 'unauthorised' absences as soon as possible. Early prevention may forestall subsequent potential persistent absence.

Suddenly, at the age of 10, he started missing school, at first only for a day or two and then for several days at a time. He complained of feeling unwell. After the school referred him to the education welfare service, he was taken to see his general practitioner and the local educational psychologist. Subsequent investigations found that Aled was suffering from diabetes and had a hearing loss. After medication and the fitting of a hearing aid, Aled's attendance improved. Although academically behind many of his peers, he is enjoying school more."

    "context_enriched_content": "Playtime\nCreating a well-structured playtime can help tackle the inactivity, boredom and poor behaviour of children who spend approximately a quarter of their school day in the playground.\nAn unstructured playtime can sometimes be the cause of a range of behavioural incidents which not only impact on the health and well-being of other children but also upon the morale of the midday supervisors. If these are not dealt with appropriately, such incidents can carry on after playtime and impact on lessons.\nIt is therefore important to create a well-structured playtime with trained midday supervisors and support staff to ensure consistency between classroom and playground behaviour. Incidents must also be dealt with effectively and immediately to prevent them escalating and recurring.\nThere are a number of possible reasons why children display inappropriate behaviour during playtime. These include the following.\n- Unstructured playtimes.\n- Lack of appropriate space to play.\n- No play equipment.\n- Children being unfamiliar with playground rules.\n- Disagreements, e.g. over a game of football.\n- Bullying.\n- Children lacking coping skills.\nIn order to encourage the right conduct, staff training on playground procedures is essential. It is important that all school staff apply the same principles and procedures."

Engaging in play enables children to discover more about themselves and the world. Play provides opportunities for children to learn through imitation, imagination and fun, and to learn about experiencing the consequences of their actions.\nPlay also has an effect on a child's stress levels. For example, stress chemicals are lowered in the body thereby enabling the child to deal with stressful situations more successfully by playing imaginatively and creatively. Gentle rough and tumble play and laughter are also known to have anti-stress effects, activating the brain's emotion-regulating centres and causing the release of opioids, the natural brain chemicals that induce feelings of pleasure and well-being (Sunderland, 2006).\nEvidence has shown (e.g. Heck et al., 2001) that children who engage in cooperative games (non-competitive games) are less likely to engage in aggressive behaviour. Invite your local authority physical education instructors to teach the children (and playground buddies) a range of cooperative games and activities."

Therefore they should not have the authority to punish younger peers in, for example, 'time out' or be entitled to remove them from the playground. Instead, they must inform whoever is on duty about the situation and the adult in charge will then take the appropriate action.\nBenefits of buddy schemes include:\n- reducing incidents of inappropriate behaviour\n- encouraging more children to play together\n- promoting anti-bullying\n- enabling children to resolve play and friendship problems in a fair way\n- helping children find friends\n- making the playground a happier and safer place\n- helping to raise the self-esteem of children\n- providing positive role models for younger children\n- supporting staff."

By looking after yourself, you will help to make sure you're fit and healthy and in a better state of mind to help your children. Teachers sometimes feel guilty about doing so, as if they are putting their own needs before those of their children, but doing so will help you to provide more quality time and better teaching for your children.\nMcGee* (2001) defines GUILT as:\n- G ive yourself\n- U ninterrupted\n- I ndulgent\n- L eisure and pleasure\n- T ime at least twice a week."

    "context_enriched_content": "You are only human\nNot everything is going to go the way you anticipated, whether it's a lesson or a challenging situation. So don't pretend. Children have more respect for teachers who are human and communicate what went wrong and how it can be dealt with more effectively in the future. For example, 'Lana I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to speak to you today about your trip to London, so what I need you to do is to find me tomorrow break time in the playground so we can have a chat.' We can achieve this by following our own social rules and by saying what we mean. It is important to mean what we say by developing our own self-awareness and expressing ourselves correctly."

Instead be proactive and talk about it.\n* 59 Minutes to a Calmer Life by Paul McGee (Go MAD Books, 2001)"

Remember, mistakes are merely portals to learning.\n- It is important to understand that children's behaviour may only improve slightly or sometimes not at all. It may even get worse before it gets better, which can make us feel helpless, even inadequate.\n- Keep a flexible approach and do what works best for you and the children.\n- Plan ahead, but be flexible and accept change. Remember it takes time to accomplish all your goals. Also, keep your goals realistic.\n- Don't take it personally when sometimes children will not show appreciation for your efforts.\n- If you feel overwhelmed, chat it through with another member of staff.\n- Take time out to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, including exercise, healthy eating and sleep.\n- And, finally, try to maintain a sense of humour and have some fun."

It is also the responsibility of the headteacher to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all children in the school.\nThe headteacher keeps records of all reported serious incidents of misbehaviour.\nThe headteacher has the responsibility for giving fixed-term exclusions to individual children for serious acts of misbehaviour. For repeated or very serious acts of antisocial behaviour, the headteacher may permanently exclude a child. The role of the governors is detailed in the exclusion policy.\nOnly the headteacher (or the acting headteacher) has the power to exclude a child from school. The headteacher may exclude a child for one or more fixed periods, for up to 45 days in any one school year. The headteacher may also exclude a child permanently. It is also possible for the headteacher to convert a fixed-term exclusion into a permanent exclusion, if the circumstances warrant this. The chair of governors and the exclusion committee is to be informed of any fixed or temporary exclusions.\nIf the headteacher excludes a child, she informs the parents/carers immediately, giving reasons for the exclusion. At the same time, the headteacher makes it clear to the parents/carers that they can, if they wish, appeal against the decision to the governing body. The school informs the parents/carers how to make any such appeal.\nThe headteacher informs the local authority and the governing body about any permanent exclusion, and about any fixed-term exclusions beyond five days in any one term.\nThe headteacher monitors the effectiveness of this policy on a regular basis, reports to the governing body on the effectiveness of the policy and, if necessary, makes recommendations for further improvements.\nIf the school has to use sanctions we expect parents/carers to support the actions of the school. If parents/carers have any concern about the way that their child has been treated, they should initially contact the headteacher. If the concern remains, they should contact the chair of governors. If these discussions cannot resolve the problem, a formal grievance or appeal process can be implemented as set in the school's complaints policy.\nAgreed by staff:\nDate\nReviewed annually - last review\nAgreed by governors:\nDate"
