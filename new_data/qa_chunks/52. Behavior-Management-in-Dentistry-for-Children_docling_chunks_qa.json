    "context_enriched_content": "From Gerald Z. Wright\nFew books are solo efforts and this one is no exception. If it were not for three people, it would not have been written  and  published  at  all.  The  first  to  be  acknowledged is Professor Anna Fuks. For years, my good friend Anna had been urging me to write another edition to my first book,  Behavior  Management  in  Dentistry  for Children. Urging is probably putting it mildly, but her requests went unheeded for many reasons. Finally, she put me in communication with Dr. Ari Kupietzky. His acknowledgments follow mine.\nMy co-editor Dr. Kupietzky is a very persuasive and persistent individual. We had several discussions about the need for this type of book, the differing approaches to treating children in dentistry in the world today, and the fact  that  it  would  be  timely  to  once  more  consolidate some of the thinking and writing in behavior management. When he offered to co-edit this book with me, I assented and we moved forward with this project. Essentially, the second edition is a new work including new chapters and contributors. Once the planning and writing was under way, I realized that he is a well-organized person, has an excellent knowledge of the most current literature, and possesses  a  passion  to  meet  deadlines.  He  has  been  a pleasure to work with.\nThe third person who was influential in this project was my wife, Nancy Wright. She knew that I was unsure about  involving  myself  in  this  commitment;  it  was twelve years since my retirement from dental teaching and practice. She urged me to go ahead with this book. Not  only  did  she  provide  encouragement,  but  Nancy read  and  commented  upon  most  of  the  chapters  to which  I  contributed.  Her  professional  background  in psychology  was  instrumental  in  creating  numerous 'book discussions' in our home.\nAri and I enlisted fourteen contributors from five different countries to lend their expertise to this book. Each of them provided worthy chapter drafts, met deadlines and accepted our editing with grace and understanding. Consequently, the book was completed ahead of schedule.\nThere  were  many  others  who  contributed  as  well. Rick  Blanchette  of  Wiley  supported  our  project  and quickly arranged a book contract. All of the Wiley people  have responded to our many questions and made helpful  suggestions,  especially  Melissa  Wahl  and  Teri Jensen, who steered our manuscript through to completion. Jill Wright helped when my computer skills were lacking, and she facilitated copying of the original manuscript, allowing us to get a quick start in the writing. Dr.  Sergio  Weinberger and his office staff came to my rescue when I needed certain photographs. I also would like to acknowledge the assistance provided to me from the A&B Taylor Library staff at Western University who guided me in finding obscure references."

Wright. The book has been a bible for me throughout my career. Having the opportunity to work with Gerry has been a challenging experience. He is a true pioneer of pediatric dentistry.\nProfessor Anna  Fuks,  both  a  colleague  and  mentor, made the introduction to Gerry, which resulted in the writing of this book.\nProfessor  Milton  Houpt  has  been  an  inspiration throughout  my  professional  career.  His  expertise  on conscious sedation motivated me to focus on this aspect of behavior management in pediatric dentistry. He has always been in the background offering support, guidance, and advice.\nFinally, I thank my wife and children, who tolerated the long hours I spent critically reading and writing. I am  deeply  indebted  to  them  for  their  understanding, love and support. To them I offer special recognition."

    "context_enriched_content": "introductory remarks Chapter 1\nGerald Z. Wright\nAri Kupietzky\nMore than a century has elapsed since a dentist, writing in  one  of  the  professional  journals  of  the  day,  voiced concern about the behavior of children in his practice (Raymond 1875). It was his opinion that 'getting into the good graces of children is almost half the work to be accomplished.' This observation opened the gates to a flood of comments on a subject which hitherto had been unrecognized in the dental literature.\nMuch  attention  has  been  focused  on  shaping  children's  behavior  in  the  dental  environment.  Although some dentists have reacted intuitively to the needs of their child patients, others have been more systematic. They have tried to identify children's behavior patterns and  to  find  the  best  means  of  coping  with  them. Practitioners have adopted and adapted the techniques of their dental colleagues. The better methods have been passed from one generation of practitioners to the next. These  procedures  have  stood  the  test  of  time.  The cumulative effect of this knowledge and experience has been  the  gradual  development  of  an  area  known  as behavior management.\nWhen planning the second edition of this book, the change in nomenclature was an initial stumbling block. Forty years ago the foremost national specialty organization in the world, the American  Academy of Pedodontics, now known as the American Academy of Pediatric  Dentistry  (AAPD),  used  the  term  behavior management. The AAPD now prefers the term behavior guidance rather than behavior management. Checking with  other  organizations  around  the  world,  many  of which  were  non-existent  40  years  ago,  we  found  that behavior  management  was  the  global  term  of  choice. Therefore, at the risk of political incorrectness, the term behavior management will be used in this book.\nThe  study  of  behavior  management  has  undergone changes.  Early  writing  on  the  subject  was  essentially subjective and anecdotal. Interest matured in the 1970s . The  result  has  been  a  more  scientific  approach  to behavior management.\nThe  descriptive  terms  'subjective'  and  'anecdotal' might  be  interpreted  as  a  criticism.  This  was  not  the intention.  Earlier  writers  on  the  subject  of  behavior management were pioneers. They attempted to list the causes  of  uncooperativeness.  They  classified  behavior patterns. They made accurate observations. They established guidelines for behavior management, some of  which are incorporated into the foundation of contemporary practice.\nProfessional  recognition  that  the  behavior  of  the child  patient  is  the  most  influential  factor  affecting treatment  outcomes  significantly  heightened  interest in behavior management. As a consequence, dentists began to confer on the subject the same respect and objectivity  that  they  have  accorded  other  areas  of science  in  dentistry  (Teuscher  1973).  Collaborations with  psychologists and  psychiatrists  have  broadened  the  theoretical  bases  of  behavior  management. The  current  systematic  approach  has  been  referred to  as  behavioral  science  research  in  pediatric  dentistry. The maturing interest has resulted in a healthy questioning  of  our  earlier  subjective  considerations. Investigators have explored various hypotheses, new and old, in an attempt to further enhance our relationships with children.\nAs one would  expect, the practice of behavior management has been a dynamic one. Differing treatment  techniques  have  been  recommended  and debated  by  pediatric  dentists.  The  choice  and  acceptability of technique is directly dependent on the societal norms of specific  cultures. As  a  result,  today's  practitioners have a wide selection of methods which can be used for managing children's behavior."

    "context_enriched_content": "aims and scope of the second edition\nThis  book  has  two  main  purposes:  (l)  to  introduce current information basic to the understanding of children's behavior and (2) to describe and discuss many of the techniques and methods, new and old, used for promoting the cooperative behavior of children.\nDespite the numerous clinical approaches, the increased research output by behavioral scientists and the growing awareness of the importance of this area, no longer is there one up-to-date source which the dentist or  dental  student  could  turn  to  for  a  comprehensive coverage  of  the  subject.  Books  dealing  with  behavior management have come and gone. That is one reason for  reviving  this  book  with  a  second  edition.  It  is intended to integrate current pertinent information from research with current clinical practices.\nAnother  aim  has  been  to  balance  the  practitioner's need  for  some  basic  knowledge  of  child  psychology with  the  requirement  of  practical  clinical  instruction. Dental teachers and clinicians have expressed the need for  such  a  book  provided  that  it  is  relevant  to  dental practice. Little psychological background on the part of the reader is therefore presumed, but an attempt is made to build a foundation on which a practicing dentist can develop an understanding of the dynamics of children's behavior in the dental environment.\nThe  volume  begins  by  describing  in  some  depth psychological,  social  and  emotional  development  of children. What is normal behavior for a three-year-old may be unacceptable for a child of five. There are margins of normality which those treating children should understand.\nWhen  the  first  edition  of  this  book  was  written, maternal anxiety was significantly related to children's cooperative behavior and the primary focus of a chapter. But there are many types of families nowadays-single parent families, same sex families, blended families-to name a few, and they too will be discussed. While the nuclear  family  is  still  predominant  in  society,  understanding family environments and how they influence child behaviors is much more complex than in the past. Therefore, much more emphasis has been placed on the study of families of dental patients and an entire chapter is devoted to this subject.\nAs the reader progresses through the book, a spectrum of techniques for managing the behavior of children is offered. The approach is characterized by eclecticism. It includes  clinical  management  of  children  using  many non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods.\nThe non-pharmacologic techniques generally are those  which  have  been  time-tested  over  generations. They  still  form  the  basis  of  behavior  management. However,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  use  of sedation and it is obvious that many new pharmacologic methods need to be highlighted. Sedation usage has led to  numerous changes in dental practice: new sedation agents along with optimum drug dosages and new drug combinations,  guidelines  for  patient  monitoring,  and emergency measures are only some of these changes.\nAn entire chapter is devoted to the management of children  with  disabilities.  Most  writings  on  this  topic have been technique-oriented. The present chapter takes a  broader  approach.  A  disabled  child  creates  special problems  in  a  family  and  alters  the  dynamics  of  that family. Since the trend today is to maintain the special patient in the community, rather than in an institution, it is apparent that a greater knowledge and understanding of the management  of  these patients is required. Additionally, much more is known today about communicating with these children than was known when the first edition of this book was created. Some of these communication methods will be addressed in this chapter.\nIn the last two chapters the book covers practical considerations  in  the  office,  discussing  a  myriad  of  strategies. The dentist plans and has ultimate responsibility for  these  strategies,  while  the  office  personnel  carries them  out.  There  is  abundant  evidence  that  successful behavior management is facilitated by a well-run office, the employment of personnel well-trained in relating to children, and the design and appearance of the dental office. The final chapter is devoted to the office environment. Having an office that appeals to children makes management much easier. An appealing office might be considered a starting point in behavior management."

    "context_enriched_content": "aims and scope of the second edition\nBy now it should be apparent that this book has been organized to present an overview of an extremely broad field, rather than an investigation of a few topics. It was designed for all members of the dental health team who deal with children. These team members combine their efforts in the management of children's behaviors. Each makes  their own  unique  contribution  as  a  dental professional. Consequently, certain aspects of this book will be more appealing, or more germane, to one or the other of the team members. It is the sum total of the children's  experiences  in  the  dental  environment  which ultimately  determines  their  cooperative  behaviors. All team members have a stake in determining the nature of those  experiences:  each  of  the  team  members  should have a mastery of their own profession and an understanding of the roles of office associates.\nThis book also has a major difference when compared to the original book. To elucidate some of the key points in the writings, cases are presented. The cases provide examples that make the book more clinically relevant. Some  of  these  cases  are  from  the  book  Managing Children's  Behavior  in  the  Dental  Office  by  Wright, Starkey and Gardner (1983)."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Pediatric Dentistry treatment triangle\nThe concept of the pediatric dentistry treatment triangle (Figure  1-1),  to  some  extent,  has  provided  the  framework for this entire volume. It is not possible to view any single corner of this triangle in isolation. The child is at the apex of the triangle and is the focus of attention of both the family and the dental team.\nThe two lines of communication emanating from the dentist's corner emphasize a major difference between children's  dentistry  and  adult  dentistry.  These  lines show that treating children is at least a 1:2 relationship (i.e., dentist:child and parent). Adult dentistry tends to be  a  1:1  situation  (i.e.,  dentist:patient).  It  is  extremely important  for  all  dental  personnel  to  communicate  in both directions.\nThe  arrows  at  the  end  of  the  lines  indicate  that communication is reciprocal. They also signify that the dental  treatment  of  the  child  patient  is  a  dynamic relationship  between  the  corners  of  the  triangle-the child,  the  family,  and  the  dentist.  The  importance  of this unifying concept will become evident as techniques are described in subsequent chapters.\nNote the difference in Figure 1-1 between the triangular illustrations in 1975 and 2013. In 2013, societal expectations  have  greatly  impacted  the  practice  of pediatric dentistry. The pediatric triangle does not represent an isolated environment, but rather exists within and is influenced by the surrounding society, hence the addition of the circle.\nPerhaps  the  greatest  societal  impact  on  pediatric dentistry  was  the  law  of  informed  consent.  Informing the  parent  about  the  nature,  risk,  and  benefits  of  the technique to be used and any professionally recognized or  evidence-based  alternative  is  essential  to  obtaining informed consent. The impact upon professionals became more widespread in the 1980s. Pediatric dentists became  aware  that  it  was  far  more  difficult  to  obtain legal consent from a parent on behalf of a child than it was to have consent when dealing with an adult on a dentist-patient (1:1) relationship.\nThe  term  informed  consent  first  appeared  in  the United States in court documents in 1957. It was in a civil  court  ruling  for  a  patient  who  underwent anesthesia  for  what  he  thought  was  a  routine  procedure. He  woke  up  permanently  paralyzed  from  the  waist down. The doctor had not told him that the procedure carried risks. In a subsequent civil suit, the judge in the case  ruled  that  'a  physician  violates  his  duty  to  his patient and subjects himself to liability if he withholds any facts which are necessary to form the basis for an intelligent  consent  by  the  patient  to  the  proposed treatment.' Obtaining informed consent for all procedures  is  now  mandatory,  and  it  is  an  example  as  to why society has to be considered when illustrating the pediatric treatment triangle.\nFor  those  interested  in  the  subject  of  informed  consent,  consider  reading  the  book The  Immortal  Life  of Henrietta  Lacks by  Rebecca  Skloot  (2010).  The  book relates  the  story  of  how  doctors  at  Johns  Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland took Lacks' cancer cells without asking. Until that time, harvested cancer cells always died. Lacks' cells never died and they launched a  medical  revolution.  They  provided  researchers  with an avenue to investigate cancer. The cells became known as  the  HeLa  cells  and  they  launched  a  multi-million dollar  industry.  Cells  were  produced  and  sold  for research. The Lacks family was totally unaware of this and they did not profit at all.\nSocietal norms affect all corners of the triangle individually,  as  well  as  the  interactions  between  all  three\nFigure 1-1.

The professional relationships between dentist and child and dentist and parent have also evolved, dictated by societal changes. In 1975, it was widely accepted that a mother's attitude significantly  affected  her  offspring's  behavior  in  the dental office. Roles in families are changing and now the total family environment has to be considered. A father bringing a child for treatment is not unusual. Not infrequently, both parents are working and the child presents at  the  dental  office  with  a  caregiver.  Hence,  the  new triangular  illustration  recognizes  the  change  that  has occurred in the last 40 years. This book will highlight some of these changes and identify how they have influenced the practice of pediatric dentistry."

    "context_enriched_content": "What is Behavior Management?\nMcElroy (1895) inadvertently provided a definition for behavior management  near the beginning of this century.  She  wrote,  'although  the  operative  dentistry may be perfect, the appointment is a failure if the child departs in tears.' This was the first mention in the dental literature of measuring the success or failure of a child's appointment on anything other than a technical basis.\nThe  term  behavior  management,  or  its  synonym child  management,  has  been  used  repeatedly  in  dentistry for children. Generally, it has referred to methods used to obtain a child's acceptance of treatment in the dental  chair.  Considering  the  frequency  with  which these terms have  been  applied,  it  was  somewhat surprising  that  a  precise  definition  was  non-existent when the first edition of this book was produced. For the purpose of that monograph, the term behavior management was defined as follows:\nIt  is  the  means  by  which the dental health team effectively  and  efficiently  performs  treatment  for  a  child patient  and  at  the  same  time  instills  a  positive  dental attitude.\nNote  that  this  definition  makes  no  mention  of  any specific techniques or modalities of treatment. Years ago discussions with colleagues led to the belief that behavior management was absolutely non-pharmacologic. Some stated that behavior management was not truly   practiced when drugs were employed to allay apprehension.\nDrugs are an adjunct to behavior management. Their use  depends  upon  the  philosophy  and  attitudes  of  the dentist.  Personalities and educational backgrounds tend to influence clinical practice (Wright and McAulay 1973). However,  as  long  as  the  proposed  definition  has  been satisfied,  it  is  behavior  management. Not all techniques advocated in this book will be the reader's personal choice. But they are the means by which some dentists successfully practice behavior management with children.\nReasonable cooperation between child and operator is implicit in the proposed  definition of  behavior management.  What  is  meant  by  'reasonable'  varies from  operator  to  operator.  This  will  be  discussed  at length  in  Chapter  Three.  Meanwhile,  consider  the meaning of two key words in the proposed definition: effectively and efficiently. They are important to a contemporary definition.\nEffective  service  is  the  provision  of  high  quality treatment. Treatment should not be modified to the detriment  of  a  child's  oral  health.  For  example,  totally untreated dental caries exposed to the oral environment until  a  patient  gets  older  is  unacceptable.  It  is  not behavior management, and it is not good dentistry.\nEfficient service has to be considered in private practice  today.  The  day  is  past  when  the  dentist  plans  to 'give a child a ride in the chair' over a series of appointments without accomplishing any treatment objectives. Neither the parent nor the dentist can usually afford this unnecessary expenditure of time. Quadrant dentistry or half-mouth  dentistry  using  auxiliary  personnel  is  the rule when one considers an efficient practice. Introduction to dentistry should be accomplished gently and with the greatest facility.\nThe final part of the proposed definition of behavior management stresses the importance of creating positive attitudes in children. That attitude may become positive after a single appointment or over a series of appointments.  Indeed,  the  positive  attitude  sometimes  takes years to develop. Many practitioners have believed that getting the job done without taking into consideration their child patients crying is behavior management. This is not good enough.\nSince  the  introduction  of  this  definition,  the  AAPD guidelines have stated (AAPD Reference Manual, 2011):\nThe goals of behavior guidance are to establish communication, alleviate fear and anxiety, deliver quality dental care, build a trusting relationship between dentist and child, and promote the child's positive attitude toward oral/dental health and oral health care.\nAs the reader can see, these goals are very similar to the definition proposed for this book."

    "context_enriched_content": "importance of Behavior Management\nIf a generalization can be made about dental curricula of the  past,  it  is  that  the  study  of  human  behavior  has played a secondary role to the scientific and technical\nlearning. Recognizing  this in academia,  behavioral sciences  now  are  included  as  an  integral  part  of  a modern  curriculum,  and  behavior  management  has been a part of this newly developing course of study. It is taught using a multimedia approach. Educators have an array of literature, films and videotapes to call upon as effective teaching aids.\nConcomitant  with  expanded  teaching  in  behavior management, there was a surge in behavior management research. It was spurred on by educators like McDonald, (1969) who wrote, 'Until recently little research has been undertaken  to  provide  answers  to  even  the  common problems  associated  with  the  guidance  of  the  child's behavior  in  the  dental  office.'  The  emphasis  on  the humanistic  aspect  in  teaching  and  research  has  led to many fine studies published in the 1970s into the 1980s. Unfortunately,  this  research  productivity  has  slowed (Wilson and Cody 2005). This is probably due to practical reasons, such as lack of funding and a greater emphasis on  other  aspects  of  pediatric  dentistry.  Funding  has  a great impact on research, and behavioral science research primarily is dependent upon government funding.\nConsiderable  effort  has  been  directed  toward  the question,  'Why  do  people  not  attend  a  dentist  regularly?'  No  simple  answer  has  emerged.  Indeed,  there are so many related variables that it boggles the mind to think of them. Does public opinion vary geographically? Does ethnic background affect viewpoints? What bearing  would  socioeconomic  status  have  upon  the question?  Dentists  have  been  aware  of  the  jibes  of humorists, artists  and  authors  in  the  past.  Have  these reflected or shaped the public attitude? When studying individual  behaviors,  there  are  exceptions  to  causeeffect relationships. When dealing with large population groups with an increased number of variables, the difficulty in establishing relationships becomes more complex. Despite the difficulties, however, certain variables have cropped up repeatedly as sources of the public's negative  attitude.  The  major  variables  are  economics and dental anxiety or fear.\nInvestigations into dental utilization have repeatedly demonstrated that many children lack care. Most utilization rates are determined through questionnaires, and the data can be skewed depending on the data collection methodology. Nonetheless, there is sufficient information to pay heed to the issue.\nIn Iowa, utilization rates ranged from 18% for   children newly enrolled in a Medicaid program to 58% for children in the State Children's Insurance Program (Damiano et  al.  2006).  Focusing  on  adolescents,  McBroome et al. (2005) studied the impact of the Iowa State Children's Health Insurance Program on dental care access. They determined that adolescents were least likely to have an annual  dental  visit  and  one  in  six  had  unmet  dental needs. They concluded that non-financial barriers existed for many adolescents. Relative to other services, dental care was reported to have the highest in unmet needs.\nThe California Health Care Foundation's Step by Step program  investigated  utilization  in  eight  California Healthy Kids programs. Once more, low utilization was found ranging from 14% in Fresno County to 48.4% in Santa  Cruz  County with an average of 32.6% (Phipps and Diringer 2006).\nSimilar findings have  been reported in Alberta, Canada  (Amin  2011).  Using  data  gathered  from  telephone interviews of 820 clients selected from the Alberta Child Health Benefit Program, it was found that only 33.7% of children two to four years of age had received dental services in the previous year. Better results were achieved for children five to nine years of age as 83.5% had received one or more dental services."

    "context_enriched_content": "importance of Behavior Management\nIt is important to point out that progress is being made in the United States. Some locales have found an increase in utilization rates. Wall's dental Medicaid report (2012) compared  data  from  several  years  of  Medicaid  children's dental visits. The report showed a steady increase of access to dental care. Approximately 40% of children enrolled in the Medicaid program received a dental service in the previous year. This reflected a 50% increase over the 27% of children who received a dental service in 2000.\nFurther  evidence  of  improved  access  to  dental  care was reported by Isong et al. (2012). These investigators referred to previous studies that repeatedly documented marked racial /ethnic disparities in American children's receipt  of  dental  care.  They  analyzed  data,  gathered between 1964 and 2010, on race and dental care utilization  for  children  two  to  seventeen  years  of  age  and were  able  to  demonstrate  a  dramatic  narrowing  of African American/white disparities. The disparities in children's  dental  utilization  rates  were  significantly different  in  1964  but  were  non-significant  in  2012. Considering all children, regardless of race, those without  a  dental  visit  in  the  previous  12  months  declined significantly from 52.4% in 1964 to 21.7% in 2010.\nIn a perfect world, every child would receive routine dental care. However, as the foregoing clearly demonstrates, it is not a perfect world and many children go uncared for. Why? Many have attempted to answer the question. It is complex and no single variable can provide  the  answer.  Numerous  practical  barriers  to  care have  been  described,  such  as  a  limited  availability  of dental  providers,  low  reimbursement,  and  transportation  difficulties.  The  cost  of  dental  care  has  also  been suggested as a chief reason why many do not attend to their dental needs on a regular basis. While this may be a good reason for some, poor attendance at low-income,\ngovernment-sponsored dental programs discounts the economic factor as a chief barrier. It is apparent that the reasons many people do not seek regular dental care go well beyond the simplistic contention of some that if the economic impediment were removed, then demand and dental  care  standards  would  improve.  Other  factors obviously affect public attitude and utilization.\nThe  importance  of  behavior  management  becomes more important when assessing the effects of dental anxiety. It completely limits, or partially limits, utilization of health care (Berggren and Meynert, 1984; Locker, 2003). A more recent French national cross-sectional survey of dental anxiety found farmers and low-skilled workers significantly more anxious than shopkeepers and executives. Anxiety was also associated with avoidance of care and lack of regular dental visits (Nicholas et al. 2007).\nEvidence for the role of conditioning in dental anxiety, through  either  aversive  experiences  or  family  influences,  has  been  provided  by  Berggren  and  Meynert (1984)  and  Shoben  and  Borland  (1954).  The  latter, working with adults, studied fear and its relationship to dentistry. Using  the paper-and-pencil  questionnaire method, they found that a significant factor in the population's background appeared to be the attitude of the patient's family toward dentistry. Their widely quoted finding points to the origin of fears in childhood.\nWhile dental anxiety has been studied to determine its effect on dental care, little attention has been given to the age of onset of dental anxiety, even though it may have a bearing on the origins of dental fear. Locker et al. (1999) studied this variable by means of mail surveys. Based upon 1420 responses, 50% of those who replied identified that the onset of their anxiety was in childhood and 22% reported their anxiety stemmed from adolescence.  Considering  the  variables  leading  to  childhood anxiety, there was a strong association with an aversive incident. Interestingly, half  who  had  child  anxiety onset  also  reported  that  they  had  a  mother,  father  or sibling who was anxious about dental treatment."

    "context_enriched_content": "importance of Behavior Management\nDental anxiety or fear is not inherited. It is acquired, and  it  is  commonly  accepted  that  genesis  occurs  in childhood. A reasonable speculation is that these early dental  fears  shape  a  patient's  attitude  in  adulthood. Research has demonstrated that adults holding negative dental attitudes can and do convey their feelings to their offspring. Therefore, it can be concluded that negative attitudes tend to be self-perpetuating (Figure 1-2).\nThe early part of this book focuses on the family and the  home environment. If the circular  pattern  is  to  be interrupted, that is where we must begin. Since dental anxiety and fears are acquired, the most logical place to interrupt these sequential events is in childhood. It is far simpler  to  start  patients  with  proper  dental    attitudes than to attempt to change deeply rooted negative ones.\nFigure 1-2. Dental attitudes are passed from one generation to another. The illustration is a diagrammatic representation of the circular pattern.\nThe establishment of a dental home as early as the first year of life will be expanded upon in Chapter Five. The early  development  of  a  positive  relationship  with  the dentist will help shape the future behavior of both child and parent. It is obvious that in order to accomplish this, early dental exposures must occur with a minimum of psychological  trauma.  Thus,  the  need  for  continually improving behavior management becomes obvious and extremely important.\nTo recapitulate, this section has attempted to explain the importance of behavior management. It has provided an overview of the question, 'why do people avoid dentistry?'  The  problem  is  multidimensional.  Two  major factors were discussed: economics and dental anxiety or fear. Both are important. However, dental anxiety or fear seems to be most consistently related to negative attitudes toward dentistry.\nConsiderable effort has been expended by organized dentistry over the years to improve its image. If we are to  promote  positive  dental  attitudes  and  improve  the dental health of the public, then children are logically the  keys  to  the  future.  No  greater  compliment  can  be paid  to  the  dentist  than  when  the  parent  of  a  young patient says, 'I can't understand it, but my kids really look forward to going to the dentist.' That is another reason for this book."

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding Key Moments in Child Development\nEileen Wood\nDevelopmental psychologists examine changes in physical, cognitive, and social/emotional development across  the  lifespan.  Understanding  how  changes  in each of these domains occurs allows researchers and practitioners  to  predict  how  individuals  of  different ages and abilities will react and behave in familiar and novel situations. This chapter will summarize changes that occur in each of the physical, cognitive and social/ emotional  domains  in  typically  developing  children, and  will  provide  insight  regarding  what  to  expect from  children  and  adolescents.  One  caveat  before reading  further  is  that  the  developmental  sequences summarized  here  represent  'averages,'  or  estimates of children's abilities, expectations and experiences at any  given  point  in  development.  Individual  differences  among  children  are  great,  and  even  within  an individual child there may be variation in development. For  example,  while  language  skills  may  be  high, physical  development  may  lag  behind  peers  of  the same age. Thus, we must be careful not to overgeneralize  based  on  a  single  observation,  nor  should  we expect  all  children  to  conform  to  a  single  'right' pattern of development.\nThe information provided here explains how development  progresses  and  identifies  when  major developmental changes typically are observed with the understanding  that  practitioners  working  with  children must be ready to shift their expectations depending  on  their  encounters  with  each  individual  child. Much of the information in this chapter deals with early childhood  and  presents  information  that  often  is  not found  in  dental  writings.  However,  more  and  more importance is being placed upon knowledge about the early years and how this contributes to understanding future development."

An incredible amount of development occurs prior to birth as well as  in  the  first  few  years  of  life,  and  the  outcomes  of these  early  experiences  can  have  a  lasting  legacy.  For this  reason,  knowing  a  little  about  a  child's  early development  is  important  in  assessing  clinical  issues about the child. In addition, having this information reinforces the important role practitioners can play in assisting to-be parents through pregnancy and early infancy. Throughout  this  section,  both  nature  (i.e.,  biological/ genetic)  and  nurture  (i.e.,  environmental)  issues  are highlighted, as both of these factors interact to shape the individual. By adopting this interactionist perspective, it  becomes  clear  why  all  practitioners  should  take  an active role in providing the best start for young lives."

    "context_enriched_content": "setting good foundations: Prenatal and early Development\nAdvances in technology have allowed us to see that critical  brain  development  occurs  much  earlier  than  we originally  imagined.  Indeed,  the  vast  majority  of  the neurons an individual will ever have are formed by the end  of  the  second  trimester  of  pregnancy  (Kolb  and Fantie 1989; Rakic 1991). This is followed by the 'brain growth spurt' between the last three prenatal months to the end of an infant's second year, when more than half of an individual's adult brain weight is achieved (Glaser 2000). During the brain growth spurt, more neurons are\nproduced and it has been suggested that this abundance of neurons prepares the infant to face the myriad of possible  sensory  and  motor  experiences  that  could  occur (Greenough et al. 1987: 2002). Since no individual experiences every possible form of stimulation, unnecessary neurons fail to thrive or serve as a reserve for injuries or new skill development (Elkind 2001; Huttenlocher 1994; Janowsky  and  Finlay  1986).  In  addition,  neurons  that successfully  interconnect  with  each  other  crowd  out those  that  do  not.  Both  maturational  unfolding  and early experience, therefore, are important determinants of brain growth (Greenough et al. 1987; Johnson 1998, 2005; Thompson and Nelson 2001).\nPhysical growth also occurs at a rapid pace prenatally, during infancy, and through the early childhood years. The pace then tapers until adolescence when it increases again.  With  some  exceptions,  growth  tends  to  follow both a cephalocaudal (i.e., from head to toe) and proximodistal  (i.e.,  from  the  center  of  the  body  outward) pattern  (Kohler  and  Rigby  2003).  For  example,  prenatally, the head grows much faster than any other body part-so  much  so  that  at  birth,  infant  head  sizes  are approximately 70% of their later adult head size (Shaffer et  al.  2010).  This  growth  in  head  size  is  followed  by quick growth in the trunk area over the first year, which is then followed by rapid growth in leg length until adolescence,  when  both  the  trunk  and  legs  lengthen. Proximodistal growth is also observed prenatally as the chest  and  internal  organs  form,  followed  by  the  arms and legs, and then the hands and feet. The growth of arms and legs outpaces the growth of hands and feet until puberty, when the hands and feet become the first body parts to reach adult proportions, followed by the arms  and  legs  and,  finally,  the  trunk  (Tanner  1990). Muscular development also proceeds in cephalocaudal and proximodistal directions, with muscles in the head and neck maturing before those in the trunk and limbs. This pattern of growth can be used to explain how children acquire some motor movements before others. For example,  head  control  comes  in  early  while  precise pincer  grasps  come  in  quite  a  bit  later.  Major  motor milestones follow a fairly constant pattern. For a quick review of actions and expected trajectories see Table 2-1. It is important to keep in mind, however, that although the pattern of change tends to be similar across individuals, there is considerable variation in the acquisition of skills (resulting from differences in the timing of growth spurts, the amount of growth that takes place, and stimulation  from  the  environment). As  long  as  the  skill  is attained within the expected range, there is no particular advantage for earlier versus later acquisition.\nWhile  enriching  environments  can  promote  healthy growth, teratogens (e.g., drugs, diseases, environmental hazards such as X-rays or toxic waste) are agents in the environment  that  can  cause  birth  defects  (including facial and dental deformities), intellectual deficits, behavioral problems and death (Kopp and Kaler 1989, Mattson and Riley 2000). Many teratogens do the most harm during the first trimester, when there are critical periods  where  certain  body  structures  develop.  Other"

    "context_enriched_content": "Coming Prepared for action: infants and young Children\nRefinements  in  physical  development  prepare  infants and  children  for  increased  mobility.  Mobility  is  one important foundation for encouraging exploration. For example, once infants attain head and neck control they can orient themselves toward interesting things to watch or  hear.  Rolling,  sitting,  standing,  and  walking  (milestones shown in Table 2-1), continue to expand access to intriguing, novel, and familiar stimuli that fill children's worlds. Indeed, infants are not the 'helpless,' dependent, and passive participants  in  the  world  that  we  viewed them as in the past. We now know that infants arrive as active,  engaged  learners  equipped  with  an  impressive range of reflexes and sensory skills that allow them to respond  to  the  vast  array  of  stimuli  that  the  world presents.\nAmong their repertoire of early reflexes are sucking, swallowing, coughing, and blinking, which serve important survival and protective functions. Similarly, other,  less  well-known  reflexes  such  as  the  rooting reflex-which  occurs  when  an  infant  is  stroked  on  the cheek, resulting in the infant opening its mouth and preparing  to  latch  to  a  nipple-also  provide  infants  with skills  to  help  them  survive.  In  some  cases,  problems with reflexes such as sucking may lead to referral to a dentist. For example, mothers may be referred to a lactation  consultant,  who,  in  turn,  sometimes  calls  upon  a pediatric dentist to assess the need for a lingual frenectomy. Thus pediatric dentists need to be familiar with a newborn's  features,  development,  and  characteristics since  they  may  be  referred  infants  shortly  following their birth for examination.\nNewborns  also  demonstrate  reflexes  that  appear  to serve  no  apparent  function.  For  example,  the  Palmar grasp  involves  infants  closing  their  hand  around  any object placed in the palm. Although parents and other care providers are often delighted when it appears that the infant is 'holding' their finger, reflexes such as the Palmar grasp are believed to be vestiges from our evolutionary past. The presence of these reflexes at birth, as well  as  their  disappearance  in  the  first  few  months\n(when  reflexive  behaviors  come  under  the  voluntary control of higher brain centers), are early indicators for assessing development of the nervous system.\nIn terms of sensory readiness to explore the world, the five senses, although  not all fully developed, are functional at birth. Newborns even have preferences for certain odors, tastes, sounds, and visual configurations. For example, infants prefer sweet tastes and are able to differentiate  between  salty,  bitter,  and  sour  solutions. They will also turn their head in the direction of a sound, and  most  show  a  preference  for  female  voices.  Early experiments  comparing  infants'  preferences  for  their mothers' voices or faces compared to voices or faces of unfamiliar females demonstrated that, within the first few  days  of  life,  infants  showed  a  preference  for  the familiar voice and face (DeCasper and Fifer, 1980; Field et al. 1984). Although vision is the least-developed sense (with acuity being about 20/600), newborns can still see all  or  almost all of the colors adults see (Brown, 1990; Franklin, et al. 2005). Newborns are also responsive to touch and sensitive to pain (Porter et al. 1988)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development: learning, thinking and Memory\nCognitive  development  starts  early  and  progresses quickly as children are exposed to rich and stimulating learning  environments.  Interesting  environments  for young  children  can  include  both  novel  and  familiar materials. Novel materials and books allow children an opportunity  to  expand  their  experiences,  acquire  new skills, and map learned skills to new contexts. Familiar materials, especially those that children can use in many ways (such as containers or blocks that can be stacked, be used to build things, or serve other purposes such as being  tools,  musical  instruments,  or  even  transport devices  for  other  toys,  etc.),  also  allow  children  to experiment  and  evolve  their  play  just  as  well-loved books can allow them to demonstrate their increasing comprehension,  letter-recognition,  and  other  reading skills. Cognitive development, then, is influenced greatly by children's experiences, the information they are given and the way in which they are encouraged to explore new information and events.\nExactly how does cognitive development take place? Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development embraced the notion of children as active, engaged learners who try  to  understand  the  world  and  experiences  they encounter (Piaget 1971; Piaget and Inhelder, 1969). In his theory,  children  pass  through  four  invariant  stages  of intellectual  development  with  each  stage  reflecting  a qualitative shift in reasoning capabilities. Schemas serve as the underlying cognitive structures that are used to\nidentify and interpret objects, events, and information that  infants  and  children  encounter.  Infants  have  very basic schemas that are refined, and replaced with more complex ones as children acquire more skills. Schemas are  altered  through  two  complementary  processes, called  assimilation  and  accommodation.  When  we encounter new objects, events, experiences, and information,  we  first  use  existing  schemas  to  understand what is going on. If the new experience does not 'fit'  (i.e.,  it  cannot  be  assimilated),  then  the  schema must be modified, or a new schema must form to accommodate  this  new  information.  For  example,  when  a child encounters a horse for the first time, they might try to understand it in terms of their pet dog and think 'this is a very large dog.' However, when they become aware that the horse is quite different from a dog, this initial conceptualization will change and they will now think about dogs and horses in a different way. Piaget believed that  within  each  of  his  stages  there  were  significant cognitive  understandings  that  children  acquire.  Once these ways of thinking were achieved, the child would progress to the next stage.\nUsing the tests that Piaget devised, we can still see infants  and  children  respond  in  the  same  way  that Piaget observed within each stage. For example, Piaget believed  that  infants  experienced  the  world  through their senses and motor activity with objects in the here and  now.  This  first  stage,  the  sensorimotor,  begins  at birth  and  extends  to  eighteen  to  twenty-four  months. Once objects were no longer in view or available, infants perceived  them  as  no  longer  there-literally  'out  of sight' meant 'out of mind.'\nA critical achievement, then, would be for the infant to  be  able  to  represent  objects  and  people  mentally, rather than just tangibly. That is, children must come to understand  that  things  exist  even  when  they  are  not immediately visible or in hand. This understanding of object permanence, at about two years of age, represents the point where Piaget believed they move to the second, or preoperational stage."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development: learning, thinking and Memory\nPreoperational  children  (ages  two  to  seven)  experience a language explosion, and with that increasing skill they  come  to  use  the  arbitrary  symbol  system  of  language to represent objects and actions. Now words and images can be used to represent things and events. As the ability to represent things increases, there is also an increase in imaginary or symbolic play, where children pretend to be other people, creatures, and objects, and use objects in creative, playful ways. Concomitant with these gains are several limitations. For example, limitations in children's schemas inhibit their ability to solve some  logic  problems.  That  is,  children  are  unable  to mentally manipulate all of the 'operations' needed to solve some problems (hence the name preoperational).\nThe inability to solve conservation problems provides a good example. An example of this problem would be to  show  children  a  short,  fat  glass  filled  with  liquid. Then, in full view of the child, an experimenter would pour the liquid from the short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass  and  ask  the  child  if  the  glasses  contained  more, less,  or  the  same amount of liquid. The answer? Most children  report  that  the  tall,  skinny  glass  has  more. Children appear to be stymied by the one change-the higher height of the liquid in the tall glass-rather than understanding the constancy of volume across the two glasses. Children make this same mistake with mass and number. When children hone in on one feature, especially a perceptually salient one, to the detriment of taking  in  all  the  important  variables,  they  are  said  to  be engaging  in  centration-a  characteristic  flaw  for  this stage-and one that contributes to their failure at conservation. Children also have challenges with reversibility. In the case of the volume problem above, children may not be able to reverse the action and understand that the liquid could be poured back into the short fat glass, which would allow them to see that the volume would remain the same across the two glasses. Centration and irreversibility are two errors that impact children's problem solving.\nChildren  in  this  stage  are  also  egocentric  in  their thinking.  Often  we  interpret  the  word  egocentric  as something negative, but in this context it refers to how children 'see' or represent the world. Think of children as  seeing  the  world  through  only  their  own  eyes  and through only their own experience. For example, a child might show you an interesting picture he has found in a book. When showing it to you, the child might orient the book toward him rather than you, leaving you with an upside-down image. The child may not seem to understand  that  you  will  not  be  able  to  see  the  image  well from  that  upside-down  perspective.  Egocentrism  also shows  up  in  children's answers  to  questions. For example,  parents  might  call  out  to  their  young  child 'Where are you?' and get the reply 'Here.' The child is not trying to be obstinate or deliberately vague. Instead, the child looks around the environment that he can see and it is obvious to him that 'here' is where he is. These cognitive traits for two to seven year old children can have great import when communicating with preoperational children in the dental office.\nBy Piaget's third stage (concrete operations) children seven  to  twelve  years  of  age  are  able  to  navigate  the problems of preoperational thinking. They can decenter their thinking and focus on more than one dimension of a stimulus at a time. They understand the concepts of reversibility  and  conservation  (although  conservation comes in slowly with conservation of mass, for example, preceding  conservation  of  volume).  They  can  also\n(b)\nFigure 2-1. Allowing children to 'teach' their favorite stuffed toy or a puppet can make the setting more memorable and more personally relevant for pediatric patients (a).

What is the limitation  for  children  in  this  stage?  The  label  'concrete' describes the most significant limitation. Children can apply  logical  operations  only  to  concrete  problems. Abstract or hypothetical problems are a challenge that is not resolved until children achieve the final stage, formal operations.\nchildren can make this possible. For instance, some dentists acclimate young children to their practice by letting them see the equipment, and maybe take a 'ride' in the chair. If this acclimation was taken one step further by allowing the child to see and test how the chair functions and how other tools work, then the children would be both familiarized and intrigued. Children may be given a dental mirror and shown how it assists the dentist in seeing the teeth from all aspects.\nThe  formal  operations  (ages  eleven  to  twelve  and beyond) stage represents the ability to fully engage in multiple forms of logical thinking. Children can think deductively and inductively. They can generate and test hypotheses,  and  explore  concrete  and  abstract  ideas. This level of thinking, however, is not achieved by all children (or adults) (Kuhn 1984; Siegler 2005)."

Many traditional  Piagetian  tasks  are  considered  too  challenging, often requiring more than one skill set simultaneously (for example, requiring both advanced verbal and perceptual skills). For that reason, Piaget is thought to have underestimated the abilities of very young children and infants. However, we continue to adopt Piaget's understanding  of infants and  young  children  as  active, curious, and engaged learners, who construct knowledge by  generating, testing, and  developing  theories  to explain their world. Understanding children in this way means  that we  should present environments that intrigue them and give them opportunities to engage in trial and error. Even small changes to our approach to\nEncouraging them to think about the process without giving  them  all  the  answers  can  engage  a  child  and begin the kind of rapport that is built upon interest and that can sustain engagement with a child. Knowing that pretend  play  emerges  in  the  preschool  to  early  grade school years tells us that this is a time to use pretend play as a way to connect with children and to convey important  skills  and  knowledge  in  a  manner  that  is interesting to them. For example, allowing children to pretend to be the dentist. Having them learn important hygiene skills or routines by letting them 'teach' their favorite stuffed toy or puppet can make the setting more memorable and more personally relevant for the child. Demonstration  dolls  are  available  for  this  purpose (Figure 2-1). Regardless of age, effective teaching should involve  concrete,  observable  instructions  and  demonstrations to maximize learning."

    "context_enriched_content": "More recent views on Cognitive Development\nMore current views on cognitive development typically borrow  from  the  work  of  Vygotsky  or  information processing models. Vygotsky (1978) argues that children's cognitive  development  is  highly  tied  to  sociocultural factors. Children do not learn in a vacuum; instead, their\nknowledge is shaped by the beliefs, values and tools that surround  them  as  they  develop.  This  cultural  context influences not only what they know but how they think. Where Piaget attributed cognitive gains to mechanisms within the child, Vygotsky argues that many of the discoveries  and  knowledge  that  a  child  attains  are  facilitated through exchanges with a knowledgeable 'other.' The  other  can  be  a  parent,  peer,  teacher,  dentist,  or anyone  who  engages  the  child  and  works  collaboratively to help bring the child from their current level of knowledge to a higher level. Knowledgeable others can support learning because they can bridge the distance between what the child currently knows and can accomplish  on  his  own,  and  what  the  child  is  capable  of acquiring or performing  with  a  little  guidance  or assistance.  The  term  'zone  of  proximal  development' represents this distance in knowledge. If the distance is too large-that is, too complex-it exceeds the child's zone of proximal development, the child will not be able to internalize  or  make  sense  of  the  information,  and  the learning  opportunity  will  be  lost.  Using  Vygosky's theory  as  the  framework  for  facilitating  practitionerclient  interactions  requires  several  key  elements.  First, practitioners need to know something about the context and  culture  of  the  child  they  are  treating.  Having  a dialogue with parents can alert the practitioner to preexisting  knowledge  that  the  child  might  have  about dental  practices,  interventions,  protocols,  and  beliefs. The  importance  of  learning  about  the  child  patient  is also highlighted in Chapters Three and Six.\nThe information exchange should also consider 'tools' for learning. For example, many children today use  technology  as  a  source  of  information,  play,  and socialization.  Practitioners  may  want  to  adapt  current interventions  to  use  a  familiar  tool  (for  example,  perhaps  downloading  a  relevant  video  tutorial).  Using these tools may make learning easier for the child (See Chapter Seventeen). Similarly, practitioners can assume the role of knowledgeable others. To be effective in this role,  practitioners  must  determine  the  child's  current level of understanding and, where applicable, skill mastery.  There  is  one  additional  step.  Once  the  child  has acquired the knowledge or skill, they must be given an opportunity to practice it to ensure mastery.\nOnly with mastery can a child internalize it for later use. For example, introducing a child to independent tooth  brushing  involves  knowing  how  to  grip  the toothbrush, the ideal amount of pressure, the direction of  brushing,  the  number  of  strokes,  rinsing,  etc.  By breaking down the task to its elements and checking to see  what  the  child  can  already  do,  practitioners  can then provide instruction and opportunities for practice so the child can acquire the skills and knowledge that is currently missing.\nWhat  can  be  expected  when  teaching  oral  hygiene techniques to children? Children usually can brush their teeth by six years of age and efficiently floss their teeth by about nine. If these two tasks, requiring manual and digital skills, are considered developmental milestones, then six and nine years of age represent the average ages that a child can be expected to accomplish these tasks. What also has to be considered is the 'normal range.' Thus, self-tooth brushing can be anticipated at about six years (± one year) and self-flossing at nine years (± one and a half  years).  The  general  principle  that  developmental  tasks  tend  to  occur  with  wider  ranges  of  normality as age increases can and should be applied when teaching children oral hygiene techniques."

    "context_enriched_content": "More recent views on Cognitive Development\nInformation  processing  models  have  been  used  to explain how attention, memory, and higher order skills develop  and  function.  In terms  of attention, it is well-known that younger children have shorter attention spans  than  older  children.  This  is  why  many  dentists have advocated shorter appointments for younger children.  In  part,  this  is  a  function  of  the  challenges  that younger children face. Specifically, young children are less  attentive,  more  easily  distracted  by  the  multitude of  other  interesting  things  in  their  environment,  and they  are  susceptible  to  intrusive  thoughts  or  actions. Hence, the introduction of distraction with video tapes or  television  has  worked  well  with  younger  children (Hinotsume et al. 1993). Overall, children can be easily distracted by interesting, novel stimuli. Distraction can be used as a tool when we do not want children to notice things, but it needs to be addressed when we want children to focus. Children, especially very young children, need to be cued to come back on task and the key task needs to be very salient in relation to other things in the environment.\nAlthough  children  may  have  trouble  learning  new information in general, many children, even very young ones, demonstrate areas of expertise. For example, have you ever had a conversation with a young kindergartenaged child about the topic of dinosaurs and found that you did not know all the types of dinosaurs or whether they  were  omnivores,  carnivores,  or  herbivores?  This situation is not uncommon. It reminds us of the importance  of  recognizing  that  children  can  have  extensive domain knowledge in some areas and that they are not always naïve compared to adults. For example, in a classic experiment ten-year-old chess experts showed much higher  recall  for  the  placement  of  chess  board  pieces than adults (Chi 1978; 2006).\nKnowing that children can have 'expertise' provides practitioners  with  an  important  tool.  First,  acknowledging a child's knowledge and engaging them in their area  of  expertise  provides  one  avenue  for  building rapport.  Second,  when  a  practitioner  acknowledges  a\nlack of expertise in the domain in which the child has expertise, the practitioner can then provide an opportunity for the child to 'teach' or inform the practitioner. This sets an important precedent for the child that the practitioner may not be all-knowing. Research on child interviewing  techniques  suggests  that  when  children are  made aware that an adult, especially an authority figure, does not 'know everything' they are much more likely  to  provide  answers  to  questions.  Finally,  if  it  is possible  to  tie  information  that  you  want  children  to remember to their prior knowledge, the new information can be more easily integrated and subsequently recalled Woloshyn, Wood and Willoughby, 1995)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Feelings\nEmotional development requires mastery of two sets of emotions:  basic  and  complex.  Basic  emotions  include joy, surprise, anger, sadness, and fear. The term 'basic' reflects  the  apparent  biological  programming  of  these emotions because they appear at about the same time in all infants (two to seven months of age), and are interpreted  in  the  same  way  by  observers  across  different cultures.  Complex  emotions  (pride,  embarrassment, shame, guilt, and envy) appear later, at about two years of  age  and  onward,  and  require  both  cognitive  and social  skills.  For  example,  complex  emotions  require that a child has the cognitive skills to evaluate their own behavior relative to some self-imposed or socially construed expectation. Recall from the previous section on cognitive development that being able to fully comprehend the perspective of others is a challenging task for children.  Additionally,  children  need  experiences  in  a wide array of social contexts to understand the expectations they face. As expected, therefore, development of complex emotions is highly influenced by the information  children  receive  from  adults  (Alessandri and Lewis 1996). Thus, giving a child a prize for good behavior has importance. It reinforces the positive experience. Early in life (among toddlers and preschoolers), the expression of complex emotions tends to be limited to  contexts  where  an  adult  or  other  person  is  present who might encourage the type of self-evaluation that is needed to achieve these emotions (Stipek et al. 1992). It is not until the mid-to-late elementary school years that children internalize these complex emotions and experience them both when they are on their own and when others are there.\nExperiencing  feelings  is  one  element  of  emotional development and displaying them is another. Cultural and social rules are taught to children to help them to display emotions 'correctly' (Eisenberg et al. 2003). In order for children to comply with these display rules, they must learn to regulate their emotions. For example, North American  children  learn  that  they  should  look pleased upon the receipt of a gift from a family member. What  happens  if  the  gift  is  a  disappointing  one?  To comply with the social display rule-that the child must be pleased with the gift-the child must inhibit displaying  their  true  emotion  of  disappointment  and  then exhibit the features that will indicate a positive emotion. This  is  a  challenging  task,  even  for  some  adults.  By about three years of age, children are already beginning to try to execute display rules. Often, however, it is not until about seven to nine years that children can mask their true emotion and deliver another.\nPerhaps one of the most important feelings infants and children experience in life is the emotional attachment that forms between infants and parents or care providers. While parents often experience an intense and immediate bond with their infant, infants' emotional ties to their parents or care providers take time to forge.\nIf  you  have  interacted  with  infants  regularly,  you will probably already be aware that, initially, infants seem  to  be  quite  happy  interacting  with  anyone.  In fact,  parents  can  pass  even  a  fussy  young  infant  to another person who will be able to calm and entertain them. Somewhere between seven and nine months of age, this pattern changes and infants start to protest, sometimes quite vehemently, when they are separated from one key person (their attachment figure). Hence, during the one-year dental visit it is recommended to examine  infants  in  the  knee-to-knee  position  (see Chapter  Five).  Infants  at  this  stage  can  crawl,  and often do so to stay in proximity to this key attachment figure.  They  will  wriggle  and  try  to  free  themselves from the hold of others-even those whom they may know well-in  an  effort  to  get  to  the  desired  attachment figure. The knee-to-knee examination acknowledges their  first  attachment  as  it  allows  the  child  to see the parent's face.\nThe quality of attachment can vary. Approximately two thirds of infants form secure attachments and the"

To determine what type of attachment has formed, children up to two years of age are tested using the Strange Situation (Ainsworth et al. 1978). This technique  consists  of  eight  episodes,  during  which caregiver  and  child  interactions  are  observed  as  they have  opportunities  to  explore  new  and  stimulating toys,  encounter  strangers,  separate  briefly  from  one another, and potentially reunite. Children and care providers  with  different  attachment  types  handle  these situations differently. The term 'secure' reflects a relationship where the infant will freely explore new toys, often  looking  back  to  use  the  attachment  figure  as  a reference or 'safe base' from which to explore. These children  are  visibly  distressed  when  separated  from their  attachment  figure  and  greet  him  or  her  warmly upon return, often seeking physical contact (a hug, a touch),  after  which  the  child  may  return  to  play activities.  With  the  attachment  figure  present,  these children are relatively outgoing with strangers. Securely attached infants are typically characterized as the most responsive, obedient, and content children compared to other attachment types.\nThe most common category of insecure attachments, Avoidant  Attachment,  impacts  about  20%  of  North American infants. These infants tend to be unresponsive to their attachment figures when they are present, and are  untroubled  when  separated  from  them.  Those infants  with  Resistant  Attachment  patterns  (10%  of North Americans) seek close contact with their attachment  figures  even  before  being  separated  from  them and are hesitant to leave them, even to explore the interesting toys.\nFinally, about 5% of North American infants display Disorganized/Disoriented  Attachment  patterns.  They display mixed responses after a separation. For example, the infant may sometimes show characteristics of resistant or avoidant attachments, or they may appear confused and waffle between both resistant and avoidant responses at the same time. Overall, these infants appear to be most stressed by the Strange Situation and are considered to be the least secure (NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2001).\nAlthough anyone can potentially be an attachment figure, much of the research has been conducted with mothers. Mothers of securely attached infants tend to be  sensitive,  affectionate,  positive,  and  responsive  to their  children  (Isabella  et  al.  1989;  DeWolff  and  van Ijzendoorn 1997). They create opportunities for themselves  and  their  infants  to  interact  and  they  respond quickly  both  to  the  children's  interest  and  distress. Mothers of infants with a resistant attachment tend to be  inconsistent  in  their  responsiveness  to  their  child and  in  their  emotional  responses.  For  example,  they might  be  engaging,  positive  and  supportive  in  one interaction  and  indifferent  to  the  child  in  the  next. Mothers  of  infants  who  display  avoidant  attachment patterns  fall  into  one  of  two  interaction  categories. Some demonstrate little affection and generally fail to respond to their infants' needs and cries, while others are overly engaged and overly stimulating, independent of the cues and needs of their infants. The research with mothers is supported in father-child attachment relationships. Fathers can be the primary attachment figure and can provide the same responsive and competent interactions that mothers have been shown to provide (Roberts and Moseley 1996).\nThe  research  outcomes  on  infants  exposed  to  the Strange  Situation  have  also  been  demonstrated  with older children using alternative methodologies. That is, the  attachment  categories  observed  in  infants  are  also found in older children, and the impacts of these attachment  types  on  social  and  cognitive  functioning  have also been supported."

    "context_enriched_content": "Feelings\nThe  long-term  correlates  for infants  with  secure attachments  are  positive  in  many  domains.  In  early childhood, securely attached children are more socially skilled, they express more positive than negative emotions,  and  they  are  typically  rated  by  others  as  more desirable  playmates  (Fagot  1997;  Kochannska  2001). Positive  social  outcomes  continue  to  be  evident  by eleven to twelve and sixteen years of age. Secure children also demonstrate cognitive advantages and academic success.\nThe previous summary refers to outcomes in North American children. There is some variation in the percentages  of  children  classified  into  each  category  as  a function  of  culture.  Overall,  however,  John  Bowlby (1951),  one  of  the  foremost  theorists  on  attachment, captured the key concern with attachments. He stated that  in  order  to  ensure  mental  and  emotional  health, infants and young children 'should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship' with their attachment figure that is  mutually  satisfying  and  enjoyable. Health  care  providers  can  support  and  extend  this relationship  within  their  own  practice  by  developing protocols  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  children  and  their care providers.\nYou might wonder why children form attachments at  all.  Initially,  it  was  believed  that  infants  formed attachments  because  caregivers  provided  the  food necessary for survival, but an intriguing set of studies showed that, although having the necessities of life is critical,  close  contact-comfort  was  a  basic  need  for healthy  attachment  (Harlow  1962).  This  conclusion became clear when Harlow (1962) conducted experiments with infant monkeys in which the infants could\nselect the kind of support (nutritional or comfort) they wanted. The experiment involved two cylindricallyshaped artificial  monkey  'mothers;'  one  made  from wire-mesh,  the  other  similar  but  covered  with  soft terry  cloth.  Each  of  these  'mothers'  could  be  fitted with  a  baby  bottle  to  provide  formula.  Through  a number of experiments it became apparent that 'the infants  developed  a  strong  attachment  to  the  cloth mothers  and  little  or  none  to  the  wire  mothers' (Harlow  and  Harlow  1962,)  independent  of  which mother  provided  the  food.  In  other  words,  it  was contact comfort-the comfort supplied by bodily contact that formed the basis of the infant monkeys' attachments.  Human  infants,  too,  need  contact  comfort to develop optimally. Studies examining children raised  in  orphanages  repeatedly  show  that  healthy social development requires more than basic nourishment  and  medical  care  (O'Connor  and  Rutter  2000; Rutter and O'Connor 2004). Children require attention by a warm, close caregiver who provides comfort and attention  (Montagu  1962;  Van  IJzendoorn  and  Juffer 2006). Practitioners can support parents and infants by providing and modeling responsive, warm, and caring interactions."

    "context_enriched_content": "Compliance Through Parenting Styles\nA key goal in social development is to get children to comply with social expectations. Although compliance is  initially  controlled  externally,  the  goal  is  to  provide children with enough information, skills, and opportunities for them to internalize the values of society and comply  with  social  expectations  independently.  The first step on this path is typically provided by parents (Figure 2-2). How parents get their children to comply can  be  captured  by  three  parenting  styles  (Baumrind 1971,  1991):  authoritative,  authoritarian,  and  permissive. Maccoby and Martin (1983) modified Baumrind's groupings, renaming 'Permissive' as 'Indulgent' and adding  'Neglectful'  as  a  fourth  parenting  style  (see Chapter Four for further discussion and application in the dental setting).\nIt  is  important  to  know  about  parenting  styles because many children expect these general styles of compliance to span contexts, such as in school and at their  dentists'  office.  Many  professionals  expect  and employ a different style of 'control' than the one that is  used  at  home,  which  can  confuse  the  child  and potentially  lead  to  challenges  both  from  the  child and  their  parents.  Modeling  desirable  authoritative interactions  may  be  one  way  of  assisting  parents  in communicating  with  their  child  and  ensuring  that important information and rules are presented in the most effective manner."

    "context_enriched_content": "Who am I?\nIt  is  important  to  consider  how  children  come  to understand themselves as unique individuals in the world, and how their self-awareness will impact the way that others will likely treat them. One of the first steps in understanding who you are is to first understand that you are. Children only come to recognize that they are a separate and recognizable individual somewhere between eighteen and twenty-four months of age (Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979). After children recognize themselves (e.g., in mirrors or photos), they can begin to describe who they are. If you ask a toddler to tell you about himself, he will most likely focus on  externally  observable  attributes  such  as  sex  and age. For example, my son described himself as 'Mine big boy'. They might also use some broad social categories such as 'good' or 'nice.' Three- to five-yearolds expand this description by including possessions they might have ('I got Spiderman') or activities they can perform. Preschoolers are also capable of identifying  stable  social  and  psychological  characteristics that they believe are true to them, but they often fail to do so unless the information is provided to them. That is,  if  asked  whether  they  like  to  play  by  themselves  or  with  others,  preschoolers  can  accurately identify the characteristic that tends to be stable over time (Eder 1990).\nAs children move closer to adolescence, they begin to spontaneously  generate  more  abstract  understandings of their inner and outer selves. At this point they understand enduring characteristics about themselves, including traits, values and beliefs (Shaffer et al. 2010). Stable identities, or self-concepts, develop during adolescence,  and  at  this  point  individuals  can  provide coherent,  well-integrated  understandings  of  what  it  is to  be  themselves.  Self-esteem  develops  alongside  selfconcept. Not surprisingly, self-esteem, the evaluation of who you are, has an incredible impact on the well-being of  children  and  adolescents.  Maturational,  biological, cognitive,  and  social  influences  all  contribute  to  selfesteem. The term 'looking glass self' has been used to describe  how  it  is  that  we  sometimes  come  to  define ourselves through  the eyes of others. If  someone says  'you're  generous'  we  may  be  surprised  initially, but come to understand that as a true statement. This knowledge is then incorporated into our understanding of self, and because it has a positive evaluation, it assists in  supporting  our  self-worth.  Older  children's  selfesteem is further impacted by how they weigh or value different characteristics. If being generous was considered positive but not deemed an important trait, then it would  be  less  beneficial  to  hear  that  generosity  is  a characteristic relative to some other, more valued trait. Parents, teachers, health care providers, and peers can support  positive  attributions  and  foster  positive  selfesteem by identifying strengths in those under their care."

    "context_enriched_content": "significant Changes in adolescence\nAdolescence  begins  with  the  onset  of  puberty.  Apart from  the  visible  and  physiological  changes  typically associated  with  puberty,  adolescents  begin  to  demonstrate  significant  changes  in  the  way  they  think  and behave.  One  unique  developmental  change  occurs when adolescents experience a different kind of egocentrism from that reported by Piaget in younger children. This adolescent version of egocentrism takes two forms: the imaginary audience and the personal fable (Elkind 1967, 1985).\nEgocentrism involving the imaginary audience can be characterized simply: 'In the young person's mind, he/ she  is  always  on  stage'  (Buis  and  Thompson  1989). Adolescents believe that they are literally on view at all times and that everyone is evaluating them. Evaluations can been positive, with others admiring them, or negative, with others critiquing them.\nGiven the feeling that they are 'on view,' adolescents may spend time imagining how they will be perceived. For example, they may imagine the reaction of others when they enter their classrooms or dentists' offices and wonder how they will be judged. They may also imagine  how  they  should  or  would  interact,  what  they should say and  how  various  responses might  be received.  Coupled  with  this  imaginary  audience  is  an exaggerated  sense  of  personal  uniqueness  and  indestructibility called the personal fable.\nMany adolescents feel that they are experiencing the world  in  a  way  that  no  other  person  has  or  could. Clearly, holding these beliefs can make even the simplest  social  setting  potentially  terrifying  or,  alternatively,  an  event  that  requires  great  preparation.  In either  case,  these  beliefs  can  place  adolescents  under great stress. Adolescents require sensitivity from those working with them, as well as support to help minimize  stress  that  can  be  caused  by  these  forms  of egocentrism."

    "context_enriched_content": "Closing Comments\nThe preceding developmental summary identifies some key changes that occur physically, cognitively, and emotionally and socially. The goal was to highlight not only the changes themselves, but how those changes might impact  the  way  children  and  adolescents  understand the world around them in general as well as how they might  approach  the  dental  environment  and  practitioners.  There  are  four  major  points  that  should  be emphasized before closing, as these considerations need to be kept in mind when we meet children and adolescents as individuals.\n1. All children are unique . In the same way that adults differ from one another, children, too, are different. They differ in personality, cognitive capacity, social skills,  and  experience.  The  summary  provided  in this chapter outlines global changes that occur, but these are based on populations rather than individuals. Not all children progress through development in the same way or at the same time. Knowing what is typically observed to occur, however, provides a starting point for approaching and interacting with children, and this is a critical first step in building a relationship with a child.\n2. Children do not exist in isolation. Children come from families,  attend  schools  and  daycares,  and  have friends  and  experiences  that  shape  and  influence them. Understanding the child involves some consideration of the cultural and social context from which the child comes. Interviews with parents are important.  Understanding  how  parents  influence their children can have implications for how children expect practitioners to interact. In addition, knowing more about the child's social context is important for\ndesigning and sharing health information and protocol.  Finally,  knowingly  or  unknowingly,  practitioners provide a social context through their practice. Ensuring that your dental practice provides a positive, supportive environment for children is an important consideration for the healthy development of those children under your care.\n3. Children  may  not  have  enough  knowledge  to  understand . While it is important that practitioners never underestimate or 'dumb down' their interactions with children, it is equally important that knowledge not be taken for granted. Ensuring enough time to have  a  casual  conversation  with  children  during each visit can be important in assessing their current level of knowledge, allowing you an opportunity to present information at the right level. Using accessible  language,  concrete  examples,  and  opportunities for practice can reinforce the  conveyed messages.\n4. Taking time to establish rapport is worth the effort and time. Children  are  fascinating  and  eager  to  learn, and most desire attention and approval from adult authority figures. Providing children with a sensitive, caring introduction to yourself as a practitioner,  the  dental  practice,  and  dental  procedures allows children to develop trust and knowledge and retain some control. Respecting children's strengths and  welcoming  them  as  valued  individuals  is  the foundation  for  sustaining  a  healthy,  long-lasting relationship."

It is intended to assist the dental health team in  raising  its  perception  of  children's  behavior.  The information  will  hopefully  help  dental  professionals attain  a  greater  sensitivity  to  the  underlying  factors which  contribute  to  children's  reactions  in  the  dental office. It is this kind of broad understanding that facilitates decisions concerning the management techniques that  are  likely  to  be  successful  for  an  individual  child patient. Although clinical suggestions are offered on fostering positive reactions and dealing with negative ones, this is not the chapter's main purpose: that information receives more attention in Chapter Six.\nHistorically, early writing on the subject of children's behavior  in  the  dental  office  began  by  following  two lines of thought. First, a number of techniques for the 'containment'  of  children  in  the  dental  environment were  suggested.  Second,  the  need  for  psychological knowledge and its  application  to  children's  treatment was realized.\nIn the 1930s, the profession began to assess and detail children's reactions to dentistry. There was an immediate interest  in  these  writings  which  has  been  maintained and has steadily grown. The writings have taken two forms. The early descriptions were, for the most part, based  on  clinical  observations  and  personal  opinion. Collectively,  these  writings  can  be  highly  informative and useful in supporting theoretical guidelines. In the 1960s,  controlled  data-seeking  investigations  began  to appear in the dental literature. As a result of differing viewpoints and experimental designs, the information gleaned from these studies can sometimes be confusing or contradictory. Nonetheless, they are helpful.\nGuidelines are currently research-based. The focus is on  evidence-based  clinical  trials  (Roberts  et  al.  2010), which  implies  the  use  of  randomized  clinical  trials (RCT). Since there has been a deficiency of this type of pediatric dentistry research over the past few decades, evidence often is gathered from other disciplines such as psychology  or  medicine  (Klingberg  2008,  Gustafsson et al. 2010).\nThe  writings  describing  children's  behavior  in  the dental  office  have  centered  around  three  main  areas. These areas include: (1) classifying children's behavior, (2) describing various forms of behavior, wherein negative behavior patterns have been labeled and, (3) elaborating on factors which affect behavior in the dental environment. Hence, these main areas have served as natural focal points for the organization of this chapter."

    "context_enriched_content": "Classifying Children's Behavior\nNumerous systems have been developed for classifying children's  behavior  in  the  dental  environment.  The knowledge of these systems holds more than academic interest and can be an asset to clinicians in two ways: it can assist in evaluating the validity of current research, and  it  can  provide  a  systematic  means  for  recording patients'  behaviors.  Interestingly,  most  classification systems that are used in clinical practice nowadays were spawned from research investigations.\nWhen a clinician treats a child patient, the first issue of concern is the child's behavior. The clinician has to classify  the  behavior  (mentally  at  least)  to  help  guide  the management approach. There is wide variation between classification systems. One of the first was described by Wilson  (1933),  who  listed  four  classes  of  behaviornormal or bold, bashful or timid, hysterical, and rebellious. During the same year, Sands wrote that children were  of  five  types-hypersensitive  or  alert,  nervous, fearful,  physically  unfit,  and  stubborn.  These  systems identified behaviors during dental procedures that mainly limited success of treatment. Nowadays, classification systems are often based on principles used in psychological questionnaires. Child behaviors during\ndaily, non-dental situations may be placed into categories that  summarize  the  personality  of  the  child  (Klaassen 2002). This provides information on the attitude of the child that is unrelated to treatment situations.\nOne of the most widely used systems was introduced by Frankl et al.  in  1962.  It  is  referred  to  as  the  Frankl Behavioral  Rating  Scale.  The  scale  divides  observed behavior  into  four  categories,  ranging  from  definitely positive to definitely negative. A detailed description of the scale is provided in Table 3-1.\nThe Frankl classification method, as seen in Table 3-1, is often  considered  the  gold  standard  in  clinical  rating scales, mainly as a result of its wide usage and acceptance in pediatric dentistry research. Its popularity as a research tool has stemmed from three features. First, it is functional, as  has  been  demonstrated  through  repeated  usage. Second, it is quantifiable. Since it has four categorizations, numerical  values can be assigned to the  observed behavior. Finally, it is reliable. A high level of agreement among observers can be obtained. In fact, many investigations using this tool have shown the level of agreement to be 85% or higher-a very acceptable level in this type\nTable 3-1.

These are the criteria for a measurement tool that are necessary for a successful investigation.\nOther classification systems similar to the Frankl scale have  been  developed.  Most  notable  are  Likert-type scales,  which  have  five  levels  of  response  (Rud  and Kisling 1973). The studies of Venham et al. (1977) used the  five-point  scales  to  measure  anxiety  and  behavior (self-report and proxy-report). Repeating their study, it was found that the two scales correlated so highly that the use of a single scale seemed appropriate (Veerkamp 1995).  Other  scales,  such  as  the  Houpt  clinical  rating scale (Houpt 1993) or the self-reporting Wong and Baker (1988)  facial  scale,  are  comparable  systems.  These  are also useful in clinical settings, as well as research.\nSelf-report is the first method of choice when studying pain and/or anxiety. However, children under eight years of age have limited cognitive capacities: to depend on the accuracy of their reporting (ten Berge 2001) offers a greater risk of incorrect information. To improve the information on self-reporting rating scales for young children, some investigators  have  used  small  icons  of  dentistry-related situations  or  happy-to-sad  faces  as  clinical  endpoints (Venham et al. 1979; Wong and Baker, 1988, Chapman and Kirby-Turner, 2002). An example of such a scale is shown in Figure 3-1. In general, visual analogue scales (VAS) are the most effective with young children, with 'very cooperative' and 'uncooperative' as the clinical endpoints.\nIn her literature review, Aartman (1998) stated that the method of choice is to take two measurements, e.g., a selfreport and an independent observer, and base conclusions on a combination of both reports. However, this approach may be impractical for some researchers and clinicians.\nClassification procedures have important clinical application. Many general dentists have two thousand patients in their practices. If a fifth of these are children, the   practice would contain four hundred child patients. It is impossible to recall how each child reacted during former visits. For pediatric dentists, having two thousand children in a practice and remembering their behaviors is even more\nFigure 3-1.

Since the behavior of a child is an integral factor in  the  treatment  planning,  noting  reactions  can  be  of major assistance. Developing the habit of systematically recording  patients'  behaviors  on  their  clinical  records takes little effort and can result in a big payoff.\nKnowledge of the progression of a child's  behavior during  a  series  of  appointments,  or  over  a  period  of years, can assist in behavior management. It provides a base for planning. To gather this information, a separate column  on  the  patient  chart  should  be  reserved  for recording behavior. Figure 3-2 records a child's behavior over  several  appointments  using  the  Frankl  Rating Scale.  Note  that  the  scale  lends  itself  to  a  shorthand form. A child displaying positive cooperative behavior can be identified by jotting down (+) or (++). Conversely, uncooperative behavior can be noted by (-) or (=). This enables a child's performance to be discerned at a glance. Similar notation of behavior can be made in computerized patient charts using appropriate software."

    "context_enriched_content": "Rating 3: Positive\nRating scales, such as the Frankl Scale, have two clear shortcomings. First, they do not communicate sufficient clinical  information  for  uncooperative  children.  If  a child is judged to be (-), the scale does not identify the type of negative behavior. Thus, the dentist using this classification system has to qualify as well as categorize the reaction. An example might be: (-) timid. If behavior ranges from negative to positive during a visit, a simple notation  could  be  (- > +).  The  management  technique can also be recorded. TSD shows that behavioral change was accomplished by the T (Tell), S (Show), D (Do) technique (Addelston 1959). Personal abbreviations can be developed  for  the  various  situations  such  as  (-)  INJ, which reminds the dental team that behavior was negative at the time of injection or VC indicating the use of voice  control.  Second,  a  behavioral  scale  represents  a child's performance during the actual treatment. It has no prognostic value. Nonetheless, it helps clinicians to prepare  for  the  child's  future  behavior,  based  on  past performances, and to guide the behavior during treatment instead of simply reacting.\nSimple, direct rating scales show a high inter- and intraobserver reliability (Rud and Kisling 1973). Studies have shown substantial correlations between observations of child behaviors during sequential treatment sessions as well  as  within  parts  of  each  treatment  appointment (Veerkamp 1995b). Thus, it would be extremely beneficial for  dentists  to  learn  and  make  use  of  one  of  the  classification systems  on  child  behavior. A  few  digits  are  read  more easily than a long, detailed report on a child's behavior.\nBefore leaving this subject, it is important to note that all  clinicians  do not perceive behavior in precisely the same way. It follows, therefore, that some dentists feel compelled to develop their own classification consistent with  their  views  of  children's  reactions  to  dentistry. Furthermore, not only do clinicians perceive children's behavior in different ways, but they also tolerate children's behavior differently (Alwin et al. 1995).\nThe interesting concept of the clinician's 'tolerance level' was introduced by Wright (1975) in his original behavior management book. Consider children  who  present  with borderline cooperative-uncooperative reactions to dentistry.  What  is  acceptable  to  Dr.  Jones  may  be  totally unacceptable  to  Dr.  Smith.  Certain  behavior  may  be highly irritating to one dentist but only slightly bothersome  to  another.  The  dentists  have  different  tolerance levels. They withstand stress differently, and this influences  their  classifications  of  children's  behaviors  as well their selection of management techniques. Tolerance level is  an  important  but  seldom-discussed concept. It helps to explain differences in the numerous descriptive classifications. Moreover, an appreciation of this concept points out the necessity for educators to train dentists in a variety of management techniques."

    "context_enriched_content": "Descriptions of Behavior\nIn describing child behavior, the interest or emphasis in the  literature  has  been  on  behaviors  that  dentists  find difficult to deal with or are inappropriate in some way.\nHowever, there are other aspects of behavior that sometimes  can  be  important,  and  dentists  may  need  to consider these as well. Questionnaires appear in Chapter Six  that  can  be  used  to  investigate  children's  environments,  how  children  react  to  different  situations,  and how  they  express  fears  prior  to  and  during  aversive situations. Children's methods of play and oral habits are forms of behavior. Astute receptionists can observe children playing in the waiting room and often provide important information to the clinician.\nWhen a dentist examines a child patient, one type of behavior-the cooperative behavior-is always assessed because a key to the rendering of treatment is cooperative ability. Most clinicians, consciously or not, characterize  children  in  one  of  three  definable  ways  (Wright 1975):\n1. cooperative,\n2. lacking in cooperative ability, or\n3. potentially cooperative.\nKnowing the clinical aspects of these distinctive  child behaviors  is  important  to  behavior  management  and treatment planning."

This is substantiated  by  dental  office  experiences,  as  well  as indirect data from behavioral science studies (ten Berge 2001).  Cooperative  children  are  reasonably  relaxed. They have minimal apprehensions. They may be enthusiastic. Further description of their reactions appears in Frankl's positive groupings (Table 3-1).\nChildren judged to be cooperative can be treated by a straightforward, behavior-shaping or tell-show-do approach (see Chapter Six). When guidelines for their behavior have been established, they perform within the provided framework. These children present a 'reasonable level' of cooperation, which allows the dentist to function effectively and efficiently. They seldom require pharmacologic adjuncts to help accomplish their treatments."

This  could  include  very  young children (less than three years of age) with whom communication cannot be established. Comprehension cannot be expected. If their treatment needs are urgent, they can pose major behavioral problems. Pharmacologic adjuncts may be required for their treatment. MacDonald (1969) referred to these children as being in the pre-cooperative stage. For these children, time usually solves the behavior problems. As they grow older, they develop into cooperative dental patients and treatment is provided with behavior shaping.\nAnother  group  of  children  who  lack  cooperative ability are those with specific debilitating or handicapping conditions. The severity of their conditions often prohibits  cooperation  in  the  usual  manner.  Obtaining information on their intellectual development can give the  dentist  valuable  information  about  the  expected level of cooperation. At times, special behavior management  techniques,  such  as  body  restraints  or sedation,  are  employed  to  control  body  movements. While  the  treatment  is  accomplished,  major  positive behavioral changes cannot be expected.\nIn  most  western  societies,  thrust  in  intellectual impairment  services  is  community-oriented,  and  as large institutions for the mentally challenged are phased out, more children with special needs are being treated in dental offices today. More and more, these children and adults are living in group and private homes within residential  communities.  Many  dental  faculties  have recognized  this  societal  change,  and  programs  have been  established  to  prepare  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  students  to  meet  the  foreseeable  demand.

    "context_enriched_content": "Potentially Cooperative Behavior\nUntil recently, the nomenclature applied to a potentially cooperative  child  was  'behavior  problem.'  The  child may be healthy or disabled. However, there is a difference between the potentially cooperative child and the child lacking  cooperative  ability.  The  potentially  cooperative child has the capability to behave well. It is an important distinction.  When  characterized  as  potentially  cooperative, the judgment is that the child's behavior can be modified: the child has the age-related cognitive capacities to learn to deal with dentistry and can become cooperative.\nPerhaps  one  of  the  most  challenging  issues  for  the clinician is to determine what behavior can be expected from the new patient. There are those children who may approach  the  dental  office  crying  or  screaming.  Their behavior is apparent. Conversely, there are children who are quiet, shy, or withdrawn. These children can be hard to  read.  They  may  or  may  not  be  difficult  to  treat. Behavioral  science  researchers  in  dentistry  and  allied professions  have  made  efforts  to  predict  children's behaviors before their arrival at a dental clinic. Since the 1990s the Children's Fear Survey Scale-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) has received considerable attention. Initially presented by Cuthbert and Melamed (1982), the CFSS-DS has been used worldwide. Indeed, it has been translated and  tested  in  various  cultures  and  nations  such  as\nFigure 3-3.

All venues had similar positive findings when rating fear/anxiety.\nThe CFSS-DS scale has been used in large patient samples between four and fourteen years of age, it is considered  to  work  well  on  a  group  basis,  and  it  has  been evaluated as a diagnostic tool on an individual level. In a  report  comparing  properties  of  different  self-report measures, it was concluded that CFSS-DS was preferred, as  it  has  better  psychometric  properties  measuring dental fear more precisely.(Aartman 1998). The psychometric  properties  were  further  analyzed  and  found appropriate for children from four to fourteen years (ten Berge  2001).  The  test  consists  of  fifteen  items  that  are shown in Figure 3-3. Each item has five different scores, ranging from one (not afraid at all) to five (very afraid). Thus, there is a possible total score range from fifteen to seventy-five. Scores below thirty-one suggest an absence of dental anxiety, or low anxiety, whereas those between thirty-one  and  thirty-nine  are  at  risk  for  developing dental anxiety. Above thirty-nine the dental anxiety definitely needs to be taken into account. Children in this group have extremely high anxiety that is undoubtedly due to more than a single bad experience or some agerelated apprehension. In general, this group needs special  attention,  treatment  time,  and  a  protocol,  likely involving pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Today the test is mainly used in two versions, one to be answered by the child who reads (about eight years or older), and a proxy (parental) version."

    "context_enriched_content": "Potentially Cooperative Behavior\nThe proxy version of CFSS-DS is used most frequently.  It  is  especially  applicable  when  children cannot read. How accurate are the parental reports? In  an  attempt  to  answer  the  question,  Krikken  and colleagues  (2013)  recently  assessed  the  accuracy  of parents  reporting  their  children's  dental  fears.  The study  was  conducted  with  326  children,  seven  to eleven  years  old.  The  children  completed  the  child version of the dental subscale and their parents filled out a questionnaire about their children's dental fears. The  two  groups'  responses  were  compared  and  the results  suggested  that  a  great  majority  of  parents are  able  to  rate  the  dental  fear  of  their  children.  If there were discrepancies, parents generally tended to estimate  the  dental  fears  of  their  children  slightly higher than their children.\nIn the Dutch population, an estimated 14% of   children suffer  from  dental  fear  (ten  Berge  et  al.  2002).  Hence, there has been considerable interest and research on the subject  of  dental  fear  and  anxiety  at  the  Academic Center for  Dentistry Amsterdam, and it is recognized that  the  CFSS-DS  is  a  one-dimensional  measure  of dental fear. It could help clinicians predict the behavior of children. In the Netherlands, children whose dental anxiety  scores  are  between  thirty-one  and  thirty-nine are considered to be in the potentially cooperative category. Knowing that they are anxious-and not simply withdrawn or shy-the important issue is to develop strategies  to  prevent  potentially  cooperative  children from developing serious behavior problems.\nThe dental literature is saturated with anecdotal descriptions of potentially cooperative patients. Moreover, their  adverse reactions have been given specific tags or labels  that  conveniently  convey  to    dentists,  in  as  few words as possible, the essence of the clinical problem. The following are some of the more common labels that have been attached to potentially cooperative behaviors. While it  is  recognized  that  almost  all  negative  behaviors  are caused by a form of anxiety or rejection of dental treatment, the descriptions only relate to the observed behaviors."

    "context_enriched_content": "Uncontrolled Behavior\nWhen an uncontrolled behavior reaction is observed in a potentially cooperative patient, it usually occurs in a child three to six years of age on the first dental visit. The reaction, a form of tantrum, may start in the reception area or even before the child enters the outer office. It is characterized by externalized behavior-tears, loud crying, physical lashing out, and flailing of the hands and legs. All are suggestive of anxiety and an extroverted personality type. This heightened state is usually seen in preschoolers, but acute stress can cause a five- or six-year-old to regress to an earlier form of behavior and act in this way.\nBecause of the furnishings in most dental clinics, the child  must  be  dealt  with  expeditiously  to  prevent personal physical harm. If any success is anticipated, a line  of  communication  must  be  established  with  the patient. In most cases, a time-out will help. If there is no behavior control, it is impossible to explain procedures. Some form of restraint  or  sedation  may  be  needed  to begin  any  form  of  treatment.  However,  most  children can comprehend the situation, and their behavior can be controlled. Thus, the potentially cooperative child can become a cooperative patient."

Jane had the first appointment. Her behavior during  the  examination  was  acceptable.  Judy,  her  twin sister, demonstrated out-of-control behavior in the reception area. Once separated from her parent, her cooperation  improved.  Later,  the  parent  was  questioned  about these two vastly different reactions. It seemed that Jane had always been the leader- better in school, better in sports, helpful at home. She was used as a model for Judy. As a consequence of the discussion, at the first scheduled operative dentistry appointment, their appointment sequence  was  reversed.  Judy  was  the  model  and  she responded admirably.\nCase 3.1, Discussion : School-age children tend to model their  behavior  after  that  of  adults  or  older  siblings. Out-of-control, immature behavior, which usually occurs with younger children, would not be consistent with their self-concept. If out-of-control behavior does occur  in  the  older  child,  there  are  likely  deep-rooted reasons for it. An attempt to understand the reasons for this behavior often reveals unusual situations and can lead to a solution.\nIn this case, where the lack of control occurred in an eight-year-old girl, the pediatric dentist realized that it was unusual and took the time to try and understand the situation. Why was Judy acting in this way? Was she really afraid? Was she rebelling? One reason might be that  she  was  tired  of  always  being  second.  Another reason  might  be  that  she  was  fulfilling  her  family's expectations.  Whatever  the  reason,  the  dentist  solved the problem by reversing the expected protocol in the family.  This  solution  would  not  have  come  about without a post-clinic interview by the dentist."

It is one way that some children  deal  with  aversive  situations.  To  some  extent, defiant behavior is controlled behavior. It is distinguishable by shouts of 'I don't want to' or 'I won't.' This is not the constructive coping style that facilitates dental care.\nChildren who react this way often perform similarly in  their  home  environments.  Their  parents  may  not provide sufficiently strict guidelines for their behavior. When  brought  to  the  dental  office against their will,  they  protest  as  they  would  at  home.  Children exhibiting this type of behavior have been referred to as 'stubborn' (Lampshire 1970). While it is generally acknowledged that there is a relationship between the home environment and behavior in the dental environment,  it  could  be  fallacious  to  make  this  connection. Using  the  Eyberg  Child  Behavior  Inventory  (ECBI), Dunegan  and  colleagues  (1994)  found  that  a  child's disruptive or non-disruptive behavior at home was not a  reliable  predictor  of  behavior  within  the  dental setting. The study used a small sample, so the relationship still is debatable.\nChallenging or defiant children often have a robust self-esteem.  They  tend  to  be  strong-willed  children who are sufficiently extroverted to express their disagreement. Asking parents how they do at home with things  like  cutting  nails,  washing  hair,  or  their  first visit  to  school  can  often  create  an  image  of  a  child without fears.  However,  it  is  possible  that  the  child may  have  been  frightened  by  a  single  intrusive\ntreatment  creating  a  solid  state  (situational)  anxiety (Spielberger 1973). A straightforward, firm approach often changes their behavior dramatically. After their  cooperation  has  been  obtained,  their  behavior should  be  goal-directed.  Definitive  guidelines  for their behavior have to be established. By challenging the dentist, an adult authority, defiant children show some  courage. With the proper techniques, this courage  can  be  used  to  affect  reciprocal  behavior. Once won over, these children have the potential to be highly cooperative and can become some of the dentist's best patients."

This  can  occur  if  the  dentist  is  unable  to  detect  the child's timidity. These children are likely highly anxious and can be difficult to treat. The dentist must proceed  slowly  and  gain  the  child's  confidence.  If  the dentist hurries to start treatment, it might jeopardize the complete treatment alliance that is needed for consecutive sessions. Compared to those behavioral forms already described, timidity is a more introverted type of  behavior.  Some  children  may  shield  themselves behind  a  parent,  but  they  often  fail  to  offer  great physical resistance to the separation procedure. Some may stall when given directions. These children do not always  hear  or  comprehend  instructions.  Therefore, the dental health team should understand that guidelines presented to them often must be repeated because of their emotional state.\nMany reasons may exist for timid reactions. Currently, it is mainly seen as an aspect of the child's personality.  Another  assumption  is  that  the  child's behavior  reflects  that  of  the  parent.  One  child  may come  from an overprotective home  environment. Another may have little contact with strangers. Other children may  be awed  by strange surroundings.

Typically, these  children  accept  treatment.  They  do  not  exhibit violent physical misbehavior, nor can they be suitably classed  as  timid.  They  are,  however,  extremely  tense. The dentist should realize that these patients are probably quite afraid of the dental treatment. In most cases a friendly word or a positive remark from the dentist, and encouragement by the dental staff, can reduce the stress considerably.\nThe term 'tense-cooperative' was coined by Lampshire (1970) specifically for this type of behavior. It  should  be  considered  as  a  positive  sign  when  children are tense-cooperative. They are probably not the most excellent communicators who express their anxiety in eloquent sentences but, without words, they try to control their emotions. Their tension is often revealed by body language. Some patient's eyes may follow the movements of both dentist and dental assistant. These children  can  be  considered  in  an  introverted  anxiety group.\nWhen considering the latter portion of the behavior management definition proposed in the introductory chapter referring to the importance of a positive dental attitude,  one  can  recognize  that  these  children  are easily mismanaged. Because they accept treatment, the busy or unobservant practitioner fails to see a problem. There are two possible results: (1) the child will either suddenly burst out in distress behavior or (2) the child will develop an attitude detrimental to future dental health.  Younger  children,  toddlers,  and  preschoolers frequently  accept  their  first  restorative  treatment  in this  way,  and  at  a  second  session  the  clinician  suddenly  finds  that  there  is  a  major  behavior  problem. Older children may grow up accepting dentistry, but voicing  dislike  out  of  proportion  to  their  personal experiences."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 3.2\nDuring  local  anesthesia  eight-year-old  Michelle  cried loudly, without any tears, and squeezed the hands of the assistant. She had no other signs of stress, before or during the treatment. But, when local anesthesia was administered  she  cried.  The  dentist  learned  from  the  intake questionnaire that she developed the crying habit when she  was  about  four  years  of  age,  and  the  crying  had continued ever since that time.\nAfter the injection, the dentist asked if it was possible for her not to cry. He explained that the loud crying hurt his ears. He also inferred that it disturbed others in the waiting room, Worse yet, he said, it makes some children nervous.  Michele  pondered  this.  Finally,  she  confessed, 'You know, I just like to scream, it makes me feel good. But OK, I've grown up now, so next time I'll help you and try not to cry.'\nCase  3.2,  Discussion : Some  view  crying  as  coping-a positive sign. When asked to stop crying, some children may remark that 'they can't.' Fortunately, that was not the situation in Case 3.2, which is almost laughable. But it  happened. Maybe the child cried for attention, or to release  her  tension.  We  don't  know  the  reason.  The important thing is that  once  the  dentist  presented  the problem  to  Michelle,  she  replied  in  a  mature  manner and wanted to help the dentist. In many cases, children will alter their behaviors if they are given a forthright, logical explanation.\nFew  studies  have  dealt  with  crying  in  pediatric dentistry.  One  interesting  investigation,  however,  by Zadik  and  Peretz  (2000),  inquired  about  parents' attitudes toward their children's crying in the dental environment.  Zadik  and  Peretz  asked  104  parents accompanying  their  children  to  dental  treatment  to complete  a  questionnaire  assessing  the  tendency  of their  children  to  cry  and  how  they,  the  parents,  perceived their own role in such a case. The investigators learned that 53% of the parents assessed their children as  having  a  tendency  to  cry  and  73%  preferred  that the operator cease the treatment and calm the crying child before resuming. They opined that the successful completion of dental treatment of a crying child is a partnership  of  the  dentist  and  the  parent.  If  parents hold  this  opinion,  it  is  important  that  the  dentist inform  the  parent  about  the  method  to  be  used  and have their consent.\nIn the past, some children have been called whiners. When  children  whine,  it  could  be  regarded  as  an acceptance of the treatment situation, but an expression of  serious discomfort at the same time. Since whining plays  a  prominent  part  in  their  performance,  their behavior is described as a distinct entity.\nIt  is  difficult  to  describe  a  child's  behavior by aural perception  alone.  The  whining  child  is,  nevertheless, identifiable.  The  child's  emoting  is  not  particularly loud-it  is  controlled  and  the  sounds  are  constant. Great patience is required when dealing with whining children. They allow the dentist to proceed, but whine throughout  a  major  part  of  the  procedure,  despite encouragements. Local anesthesia administration may have been repeated because they frequently complain of pain. It can be hypothesized that their apprehensions lower their pain thresholds. Their continuing reactions are  a  source  of  frustration  and  irritation  to  those involved with the treatment. It is part of the professional attitude  of  the  dentist  to  accept  the  whining  child's behavior.  Although  this  may  be  difficult,  it  will  ultimately lead to the best results. With a firm approach, there  is  a  risk  of  being  too  directive,  overruling  the child, and losing the fragile contact that always exists in these situations."

    "context_enriched_content": "Passive Resistance\nA  totally  different  style,  often  seen  in  adolescents,  is known as passive resistance. Picture the youngster who solemnly slumps in the dental chair. The patient does not  respond  verbally.  When  the  dentist  attempts  to involve the child in the procedure, communication fails. When an intraoral examination is attempted, the patient may reject the situation by clenching his teeth. Body language can cue this behavior. The tight grip on the dental chair may turn knuckles white. Eye contact is frequently avoided.\nThis coping style is a symptom of problem behavior caused by a bundle of reasons. It may be anxiety, a general feeling of dislike, or lack of interest in the situation. These children may act in a similar manner at home if they are not allowed to choose their own clothing or go to movies with their friends. When brought to the dental office unwillingly, they are forced into a situation which has violated their freedom. When treated as juveniles, their  self-images  are  affected.  They  rebel.  Modifying their behavior is a challenge not only for the dentist but for every adult involved (see Chapters Two and Four). In  time,  behavior  will  modify  for  the  better  when  the adolescent becomes interested in oral health. If pharmacological support helps them to relax and it is accepted by  the  patient,  it  can  be  an  asset  with  these  children. Every attempt should be made to motivate the child to accept the support of the dental team.\nLists of potentially cooperative behaviors exhibited in dental environments could go on ad infinitum. Generalized descriptions lack specificity, and children are individuals. Their behavior is too highly variable to allow accurate pinpointing. However, the foregoing labeled descriptions of negative behaviors are those most commonly observed. They should be adequate for an understanding of clinical situations when they are referred to in later chapters."

    "context_enriched_content": "factors Underlying Children's Cooperation\nDuring  the  child's  first  dental  visit,  the  dentist  needs to assess behavior in the dental environment. Behavior is  the  key  to  treatment.  Some  children  are  robust  and tolerant in stressful situations and are unlikely to present uncooperative behavior. Other children are vulnerable and may need more attention and time in order to feel at ease and to cooperate with dental treatment. The question is, who are these vulnerable children and what might  be  the  underlying  factors  which  contribute  to their behavior in the dental office?\nIt is axiomatic that an anxious child who anticipates an unpleasant experience is more likely to have such an experience, whereas a child who has a low level of fear\nor anxiety is likely to have a pleasant dental visit. But what  is anxiety?  And  what  is fear? The various psychological schools agree that anxiety is a personality trait that can be assessed based on the child's behavior (Achenbach  and  Rescorla  2001).  Anxiety  describes  an emotional state of human personality. It is referred to as a construct; that is, it is an abstraction composed of ideas and concepts. One of the difficulties is that anxiety takes on  various  meanings  depending  on  the  operational criteria employed by different researchers or clinicians (Ruebush 1963).  Hence,  there  are  many  varied  definitions of anxiety that have been used by social scientists.\nThe  crux  of  the  problem  in  defining  anxiety  is  its similarity to fear. There are theoretical differences, but for  practical  purposes,  they  can  be  indistinguishable (Levitt  1967).  Both  are  constructs  of  social  scientists with no clear physical existence themselves. Anxiety and fear are defined in words. For a definition to be operational  and  clinically  applicable,  it  should  be defined in terms of acts. Nonetheless, these terms are frequently used in behavioral science research in dentistry and other areas without operational definitions. If this is the case, any measurement of the construct is open to question.\nThe distinction between fear and anxiety is difficult to ascertain in dental situations, except for extreme circumstances.  If  a  child  has  had  several  extractions  without profound  anesthesia,  then  any  uncontrollable  future behavior could legitimately be attributed to fear. This is one extreme. The opposite is the mildly concerned but cooperative child, about to have a first dental appointment. The concern could be attributed to anxiety. The two  are  vastly  different  situations,  but  it  is  the  'gray zone,' the zone between the extremes where fear and anxiety become indistinguishable.\nAnother  way  of  looking  at  fear  and  anxiety  is  by examining the source or stimulus. Think about the fouryear-old  who  has  uncontrollable  behavior  at  the  first dental visit. Is the uncontrolled behavior fear or anxiety? Since  the  child  has  not  seen  a  dentist  previously,  by some definitions, the behavior is attributable to anxiety. On the other hand, someone at school or at home may have frightened the child with stories about dentistry. Did this cause the fearful negativism? We don't know. Again, the fact remains that fear and anxiety can be difficult to tell apart.\nNow,  returning  to  the  child  who  is  vulnerable,  the behavior may be due to internal factors stemming from chronic  fear  and  anxiety.  Psychologists  refer  to  those aspects of the individual's personality that are innate, rather  than  learned,  as  the  temperament.  Since  the 1950s, many scientific studies have shown that temperament  influences  children's  health  and  development. The  realization  that  many  behavioral  tendencies  are inborn-and not the result of poor parenting-is one of the most important insights parents (and dentists) gain from learning about temperament. Internal factors like fear and anxiety can be difficult to clarify at times, but some of the resultant child characteristics that may be in need  of  special  attention  include  somatic  complaints, such as gagging or nausea when the child becomes anxious;  overactive  or  impulsive  behaviors  (Anrup  et  al. 2002); or aggressive behaviors such as non-compliance with dental procedures."

These can be termed external factors. At the time of the first appointment or patient intake, if appropriate questions are  asked,  the  child's  history  may  reveal  important external factors (see Chapter Six for questions).\nFrom  1970  to 1985, there was  great interest in behavioral  science  research  in  pediatric  dentistry.  The focus for much of this research was to assess external factors  to  determine  which  ones  influenced  children's behaviors.  Unfortunately,  this  type  of  research  is  less popular today and much information is gleaned from older studies. However, a wide variety of variables were identified that still can be useful.

Other aspects of the medical history, such as  frequency of medical visits or even hospitalization, have not been found to be consistently related (Wright 1975; Bailey et al. 1973)."

This  variable  was studied in depth in the 1970s and repeatedly found to be significant  (Wright  et  al.  1973).  However,  family  environments  have  changed  with  increased  single  parenthood, blended families, and same sex marriages. Mothers  do  not  always  accompany  their  children  to dentists. Sometimes fathers, both parents, or caregivers bring children to the dentist. Further study of this variable is a fertile area for future research."

This  variable  has  received current  attention  from  Yang  and  colleagues  (2011). Examining 195 children three to seven years of age, they found  a  significant  correlation  between  children  with dental caries and uncooperative behavior. One advantage  of  The  Dental  Home  concept  (see  Chapter Five) is that children usually do not arrive at the dental office in need of treatment.\nAttempts  have  been  made  to  relate  other  external factors  that  clinicians  have  suggested  may  have  a bearing  on  children's  behavior.  While  some  of  these factors have not been significantly related or withstood repeated testing, they cannot be completely discounted. It  has to be remembered that research establishes relationships  with  large  population  samples,  and  dentists treat individuals.\nWhen  interpreting  responses  to  questionnaires,  the clinician  should  exercise  caution.  Evaluating  external factors in relation to a child's behavior as a cause-andeffect  relationship  can  be  misleading.  While  there  is undoubtedly some interaction between factors, no clear agreement exists on the relative importance of factors in relation to one  another.  Few  studies  have  offered information concerning these relationships.\nOnce  there  is  an  understanding  of  the  underlying factors that can influence a child's behavior, a treatment plan can be developed. Some child patients might need extra time in preparing them for what is to come, especially  those  with  chronic  fears  and  anxieties.  Patients with aggressive behaviors may need expectations clearly  explained  and  a  highly  structured  approach throughout their dental visits. Understanding the child's needs in treatment planning should enhance the possibility of a successful outcome."

All  dentists  can  recall  fellow  students  who coped  extremely  well  with  their  patients  without  any theoretical study of children's behavior. Others are less fortunate. They require information to a greater degree. Regardless  of  individual  successes  with  children,  all clinicians should strive to maximize a positive effect on child  patients.  There  are  many  ways  of  achieving  this effect. Learning about the dynamics of child behavior is one of these ways."

Along with meeting basic physical needs, families provide children with emotional support, socialization, coping methods, and other life skills. The purpose of this chapter is to review aspects of  the  relationship  between  children  and  their  families, which may influence their ability to cooperate for dental treatment. Some parent and family factors which may be manipulated  by  the  dental  team  are  identified,  and sample strategies are outlined to identify and shape key family factors to enhance child coping and cooperation. To provide the greatest value for the clinician, there is a summary of important learning concepts at the end of each  section,  translating  theory  and  research  into  the clinical dental practice with children. Dentistry does not stand  alone  in  its  interest  in  promoting  child  coping and cooperation skills, or in its recognition that parents and family can affect a child's responses during a dental appointment. Thus, this chapter includes selected research from pediatric medicine, developmental psychology, and neuroscience to supplement the dental evidence base.\nFamilies  influence  children's  oral  health  of  in  daily life through eating behaviors and oral hygiene practices. Parents decide when their children should see a dentist, choose the office or clinic and dentist, arrange the visit, and  often  accompany  their  children  to  the  appointments. Before stepping into the dental office, parents are invested in the quality of their child's dental experience."

    "context_enriched_content": "family structure\nA family is  a  network  of  interconnected  relationships. Over the last several decades, social and cultural changes have expanded the concept of what   comprises a family.\nDental practices worldwide serve a multicultural population  with  a  wide  range  of  family  structures. Family diversity includes, but is not limited to, parental status (married, divorced, separated, single, step, biological, adoptive, foster), along with differing racial, ethnic, linguistic, spiritual, religious, sexual, social, and inter-generational aspects. Parent age can vary widelymaternal age may extend from pre-teen into late middle age  due  to  the  availability  of  advanced  fertility  treatments and surrogacy, and there is no clear upper limit for paternal age. Family size and composition may range from a small and straightforward family of one parent and one child to a large and complex multi-  generational, multi-parent, multi-child family with varying relationships among the children and to the parents. Important variations within these diverse family structures are parenting style, parenting behaviors and practices, communication  style,  roles  of  family  members,  use  of  time within  the  family,  commitment  to  individual  family members, type and quality of childcare, connection to the  community,  economic  and  social  resources,  and methods of responding to challenges of life (American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on the Family 2003).\nA child's well-being is closely linked to physical, emotional,  and  social  health;  social  circumstances;  and behavior of their parents. Children do best when raised by two caring, cooperative parents with adequate social and financial resources providing a secure, supportive, and  nurturing  environment.  The  family  stress  model proposed by Conger et al. (2000) recognizes that parents become  emotionally  depleted  by  financial  hardships, health problems, marital discord, fatigue, employment difficulties,  lack  of  social  support,  and  other  traumatic life events. Parental emotional distress can lead to family conflict, instability, and disrupted, poor-quality parenting.\nIn general, stressful events which occur early and/or result in long-lasting disruptions in a child's care and\nnurturing lead to worse outcomes for children. However,  no  particular  family  structure  makes  poor outcomes for children inevitable  (American Academy of Pediatrics 2003). Family risk factors such as a single parent  household,  a  parent's  ill  health,  or  financial hardship adversely impact parents' attitudes and behaviors and reduce their ability to positively socialize, support, and guide their children during dental treatment.  Family  characteristics  of  230  children  and adolescents  ages  eight  to  nineteen  years  of  age  who were  referred to pediatric dentistry specialists for behavior management problems were compared to 248 controls without behavior management issues. Striking differences in life and family situations were found between  the  groups.  The  uncooperative  children  more often lived in families with low socioeconomic status, had  parents  who  were  not  living  together,  reported fewer leisure-time activities, performed poorly in social interactions,  had  personal  professional  support,  and had received interventions by social agencies. The 'burdensome life and family situation' was suggested as a factor explaining some of the patients' non-cooperation (Gustafsson et al. 2007)."

Other  information  to  consider includes: identity of family members living in the home, custody  arrangements,  child  care  setting  and  primary caregivers, family disruptions such as marital strain or divorce, severe illness of a family member, moving, refugee status, military deployment, social support, parent employment status, and financial security.\nUnderstanding this information will guide the dentist's  communication  with  parents  and/or  other  key family members whose understanding and 'buy in' is essential for promoting a child's positive attitude about healthy  diet,  oral  hygiene  behaviors,  and  cooperation for dental treatment. For families experiencing difficult circumstances (e.g., divorce, unemployment, moving to a new city, or death of a family member), the dentist can express appreciation for the effort that has been made to bring the child to the appointment, and should understand that recommendations for changes in diet or oral hygiene may not be actualized until the family situation improves."

    "context_enriched_content": "attachment\nThe bonding of an infant with a parent or other caregiver is one of the key developmental tasks of infancy (see attachment theory in Chapter Two). Infants become bonded, or attached, to caregivers with whom they have significant amounts of interaction. They develop a hierarchy  of  preferred  attachment  figures,  having  a  mostpreferred caregiver,  a  next  most-preferred,  etc.  Infants have limitations in their capacity for attachments, and serious  attachment  disturbances  have  been  reported among children raised in settings with large numbers of caregivers. Children who are institutionalized or maltreated may have no definite attachments to anyone (Zeanah  and  Fox  2004).  Preferred  attachments  can develop at any time after infants reach a cognitive age of seven  to  nine  months  if  the  new  caregivers  have substantial involvement with the child. Young children adopted out of foster care or institutions  form  attachments  to  their  new  caregivers,  but  in  some  cases  the quality  of  the  attachment  is  compromised  (O'Connor et al. 2000).\nResearchers  observing  securely  attached  and  insecurely  attached  children  have  found  that  those  with secure attachments are more likely to engage with their environment in an active manner. Theoretically, successfully attached infants have learned to trust the outside world as a welcoming place and to trust adults. A secure parent-child attachment appears to prepare a child to be receptive to and cooperative with parental socialization influences (Kochanska 1995). Conversely, infants whose emotional  needs  have  not  been  consistently  or  adequately met come to view the world as unpredictable and  learn  that  adults  are  not  to  be  relied  upon.  For poorly  attached  children,  discipline  is  experienced  as rejection and disapproval, and they overreact to the negative  feelings  caused  by  routine  childhood  rules  and restraints.  They  are  at  risk  for  chronic  anxiety  or  distrust,  less  able  to  cope  with  challenging  or  adverse life  experiences,  and  are  more  likely  to  exhibit  behaviors  that  result  in  adverse  experiences  (Bowlby  1982). Understandably,  children  with  insecure  attachments are more likely than securely attached children to feel threatened  by  new  or  stressful  situations  (McKernon et al. 2001).\nMost  research  on  attachment  has  focused  on  the child's bond to the mother. Recent investigations indicate  the  importance  of  the  father-to-child  bond. 'Double-insecure'  (insecure  attachment  to  both  parents)  six  to  eight  year  old  children  had  high  levels  of\nbehavior problems at school as rated by teachers and by the children themselves. A secure attachment with one parent offsets risk for poor behavior, but having a secure attachment with two parents did not confer additional benefit to the child (Kochanska and Kim 2013)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Application in clinical dental practice\nThe dentist should assess the child patient's social history  regarding  risk  factors  for  disrupted  attachment, such as: extended hospitalization during infancy or toddlerhood, early life in an orphanage with multiple caregivers, history of foster care-particularly with multiple foster home placements, adoption after infancy, history of physical abuse or neglect, or a parent with substance addiction or mental health issues. In the dental setting, a child  disadvantaged  by  an  insecure  attachment  may show extreme fear and reluctance (retreat from an unsafe and unpredictable world) or be defiant and uncooperative (battle against an unsafe and unpredictable world). Either response should elicit the compassion, patience, and understanding of the dentist and dental team. Time, consistency, and patience must be invested  when working with an insecurely attached child, using positive and incremental efforts to form a relationship and  earn  the  child's  trust.  A  long-term  perspective should  be  paramount  when  the  dentist  meets  a  child with a severe attachment disorder. An insecure attachment does not make poor psychosocial outcomes inevitable for a given child or adolescent; it is more useful to think of attachment quality as a risk factor or protective factor  in  a  child's  life  experience.  The  advantage  and psychological protection resulting from a secure attachment  enhances  a  child's  ability  to  listen,  relate,  and respond  to  the  dentist,  and  then  to  cooperate  during dental treatment. The young child will do best if introduced to the dental environment and dental team in the presence of their preferred attachment figure."

    "context_enriched_content": "genetic Contribution to Child and Parent interactions\nThe answer to the question 'Does behavior result from nature  or  nurture?'  is  now  understood  to  be  'both.' Genes and interactions between genetic potentials and the environment (epigenetics) are both determinants of behavior. The structure and function of the developing brain  is  strongly  influenced  by  social  interactions  in infancy and  early childhood. While  most  existing research on socialization was completed with observational and behavioral methods, the discipline of social and  cognitive  neuroscience  now  has  tools  to  study neural  pathways  within  the  brain.  As  this  chapter  is written in 2013, a working hypothesis is that recurrent, active, and long-term engagement in behavioral sequences (cultural tasks) shape and modify brain pathways. Connectivity and functions of different areas of the brain change as a result of experience in general, and particularly by repeated participation in specific cultural practices (Kitayma and Park 2010).\nMapping of the human genome has made it possible to study mechanisms of gene and environment interactions.  These  techniques  are  now  being  applied  to  the study of parenting and child behavior. For example, it has  been  found  that  children  with  certain  serotonin transporter gene haplotypes show greater reactivity to both supportive and unsupportive parenting styles and practices  (Sulik  et  al.  2012).  The  serotonin  transporter gene variation could offer the child either an advantage in socialization if the parent messages are clear and constructive (high quality), or a disadvantage in socialization  if  the  parent's  socialization  messages  are  unclear (low quality).\nFurther clarification of the contributions of genetics and  epigenetics  to  understanding  child  development and  human  behavior  is  expected  as  refined  scientific tools become more available and opportunities for this type  of  research  explode.  It  is  expected  that  mechanisms  of  interaction  between  all  aspects  of  a  child's family life and the developing brain will be clarified. For example, children genetically at risk for behavioral problems due to their serotonin transporter gene haplotype demonstrated low levels of self-control when they also formed insecure attachments to their mothers during  infancy.  This  finding  suggests  that  secure  attachment in infancy may protect children who are genetically  vulnerable  to  behavioral  problems  with self-control (Kochanksa et al. 2009)."

Examples of socialization include learning to share toys, obey  adult  requests,  and  behave  politely  (Maccoby 1991). Socialization also can determine a child's response to dental treatment. It can influence behavior standards, attitude toward adult authority, how much discomfort justifies complaint, and how to express distress."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parenting Styles\nA viewpoint or philosophy toward the child is reflected by the parenting style. It creates the emotional climate and context in which parents' socialization behaviors occur. Parenting style classifications consider the balance between 1) parental warmth and affection, and 2)  parental  behavioral controls. The first version of a widely used parenting style typology was proposed by Baumrind in 1973. The degree of parent responsiveness (affection  and  attentive  responsiveness  to  the  child's needs) was considered with the level of parental control (demandingness for developmentally appropriate, prosocial, responsible behaviors) to classify an individual's parenting  style  as  Authoritative,  Authoritarian,  or Permissive. Maccoby  and  Martin  (1983) modified Baumrind's groupings, renaming 'Permissive' as 'Indulgent'  and  adding  'Neglectful.'  Most  research examining parenting styles and child behavior cited in this  chapter  employs  the  typology  of  Baumrind,  as well as Maccoby and Martin. The four parenting styles and  a  brief description  of  their characteristics are: Authoritative (high responsiveness + high behavior control), Authoritarian (low responsiveness + high behavior control), Permissive (high responsiveness + low behavior control), and Neglectful (low responsiveness + low behavior control).\nParents with an Authoritative parenting style set up a collaborative  home  environment  that  is  democratic, flexible,  and  supportive  of  the  child,  with  guidelines aimed at enabling the child to become self-regulating. These parents may be warm and involved, yet still firm and  consistent  in  establishing  limits.  Rules  are  not simply  set  in  place,  but  are  supported  through  ageappropriate rationales.\nAuthoritarian  parents  clearly  take  charge,  may  be more autocratic, rigid, and use punishment as needed to enforce a high degree of structure, expecting obedience from the child. Parents shape and control their children in  accordance  with  a  set  of  standards  and  rules.  The rules are not to be discussed or arrived at by argument and interaction. On the contrary, rules are imposed upon the child as mandatory, and the child or adolescent is not consulted. Authoritarian parents discourage verbal give-and-take between parent and child.\nAuthoritarian  and Authoritative  parents  share  their high expectations for the child's self-control.\nParents with a Permissive parenting style indulge the child's  wishes  and  agenda,  placing  the  child  in  the power position with an appeasing, nondirective, lenient approach without clear rules or guidelines. They are considered more responsive than demanding. The Permissive parenting style has more negative than positive effects on the  social  outcome  and  is  associated  with  aggressive, impulsive children lacking independence and a sense of responsibility.\nNeglectful parents are less involved in their child's lives than parents within any of the other three categories.  The  passive,  emotionally  removed,  lax,  or indifferent  attitude  exhibited  by  neglectful  parents leaves the child to negotiate the world without structure,  assistance,  rules,  or  guidelines.  Indifferent  parents tend to be cold and uninterested in the needs of their  children  and  adolescents,  reflecting  a  desire  to keep  them  at  a  distance.  They  try  to  minimize  time and interaction with their children. This type of parent is characterized as uninvolved, meaning that they have a low degree of commitment to their role as a parent. There is a risk of a child or adolescent being neglected by this type of parent. Both Permissive and Neglectful  parents  have  low  expectations  for  the child's self-control."

Parenting practices are mechanisms through which parents directly help their child attain socially  valued  outcomes  such  as  development  of  a conscience, cooperation, compliance with societal rules, and academic success. Parenting practices include both specific goal-directed behaviors (time-out, physical punishments, shaming) and non-goal-directed behaviors  (gestures,  tone  of  voice,  emotional  expression)  (Darling  and  Steinberg  1993).  Children  become accustomed to their own parent's practices and behaviors  and  develop  the  ability  to  read  their  parent's internal  state.  A  typically  developing  child  can  accurately and rapidly perceive if her parent is pleased or displeased,  comfortable  or  anxious,  or  calm  or  distressed by interpreting the parent's tone of voice and body language."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cultural Influence on Parenting Style\nCulture  has  a  pervasive  influence  on  family  life, including the way in which parents socialize their children. Parenting styles and practices hold psychological and cultural meanings and vary between cultures. For example, parental harshness (hostile behavior and/or physical  punishment)  carries  a  message  of  care  and concern within a culture valuing strict behavior controls  and  high  expectations  for  children's  behavior. However, in a less strict culture holding lower expectations  for  children's  behavior,  it  carries  a  message  of unsympathetic criticism (Ho et al. 2008). It was initially suggested  that  Authoritative  parenting  likely  would result in good psychosocial outcomes for children from all ethnic and cultural groups. Some studies, however, have found better outcomes associated with the Authoritarian  parenting  style,  depending  on  family context  and  culture  (Deater-Deckard  et  al.  1996;  Ho et al. 2008). No investigation in any culture has reported consistent positive social outcomes for children of any age with the Permissive or Neglectful parenting styles; this  may be due to lack of rules and limits upon the child's conduct, which communicate  which  child behaviors are desired and expected and which actions are unacceptable.\nThe  prevalence  of  parenting  style  types  varies  by culture. Sociologists  and  educators  have  noted  an increase in the Permissive parenting type in many countries, including the United States (Long 2004). In traditional parenting models (Authoritarian, Authoritative), the adult determines, communicates,  clarifies,  and enforces rules for the child. In families with the Permissive  parenting  style,  children  question  adult authority  and  a  'the  child  should  feel  good'  ethos permeates family life and parent decisions. Permissive parents are generally well-intentioned, want to be nice, and would like their children to be happy doing what they want to do. In some cases, the Permissive parent attempts to become a friend to their child, abrogating the traditional parental role of socialization.\nThe  term  'helicopter  parent'  is  employed  in  the popular lexicon  to  describe  a  parent  who  is  attentive, hovering,  and  available  to  rescue  their  child  from  the consequences  of  any  poor  decisions  or  actions  (Cline and  Fay  1990).  Today's  ever-present  cell  phones  have made  it  inexpensive  and  simple  for  parents  to  stay connected  to  their  child,  even  when  physically  separated. It is theorized that the extension of the usual time period of parent-child close connection may prolong the child and young adult's dependence upon parent and family resources.\nThe  disparate  cultural  views  of  proper  parenting style  and  practice  between  Western-European  and\nEastern-Asian  cultures  was  illustrated  for  the  public consciousness by Chua in the book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (2011), which recounts the strict methods she used to promote the academic success of and mastery of musical instruments by her daughters. Chua's behavioral controls over her children, such as limiting access to the bathroom, requiring many daily hours of homework  and  musical  instrument  practice,  forbidding television viewing, and emotional tactics of ridicule  and  shame,  engendered  extensive  commentary supporting and criticizing this parenting style. Those embracing  the  predominantly  Western  philosophy that  children  are  fragile  and  require  protection  and nourishment of  their  self-esteem  called  Chua's  strict methods cruel and abusive. In contrast, those with a predominantly  Eastern  viewpoint  assume  that  the child has inner strength and the parent's job is to override the child's preferences because 'to enjoy anything you have to be good at it, to be good at it you have to work, and children on their own never wish to work' (Chua 2011)."

Existing research is primarily cross-sectional  with  varying  methodologies,  focuses nearly  exclusively  on  mothers,  and  heavily  relies  on subjective data such as parent reports on behavior practices,  rather  than  on  observation  of  parents'  behavior (Paulussen-Hoogeboom  et  al.  2007).  Parenting  behaviors  appropriate  at  a  developmental  stage  and  in  a specific social context will predictably differ depending on a child's developmental stage. A simple example is crossing a street with traffic: parents carry or hold the hand of a young child (high behavioral control) but do not need to hold the hand of a school-age child who has mastered the social task of safely crossing the street (low behavioral control).\nThere is no single 'best' parenting style universal to  all  children.  It  is  believed  that  a  child's  internal state of fear, arousal, and anxiety is integral to their receptiveness  to  social  learning;  the  best  child  outcomes appear to result when a parent's style is in harmony  with  the  child's  temperament.  For  example, gentle, low-power discipline has been found to create the  optimal  anxiety  arousal  for  social  learning  for temperamentally fearful children. Negative, punitive, and  other  types  of  power-assertive  parenting  have been  found  to  be  detrimental  for  temperamentally fearful  children  with  a  low  anxiety  threshold.  In contrast, for relatively fearless children, gentle parental discipline does not capture the child's attention. For low-fear children, high parental pressure results in child anger and disregard for parent  messages.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that\nreciprocal positive parent-child interactions are more effective in achieving social learning for children with low-fear temperaments (Kochanska et al. 2007)."

Sample questions are presented in Table 4-1.\nChildren raised by Authoritative or Authoritarian parents who expect and demand appropriate, responsible behavior will understand that the dentist and staff members establish the rules and will guide them through a dental  visit.  These  children  have  been  socialized  to follow  the  lead  of  adults.  The  dentist  can  expect  that most Authoritative or Authoritarian parents will endorse and support the rules, structure, and behavior guidance that the dentist presents to the child.\nChildren  raised  by  Permissive  parents  have  been conditioned to view adults in a more egalitarian manner. They may expect the dentist and staff to offer them the same degree of choices and control that they are accustomed  to  in  their  home  environment.  Since  a  dental appointment is not a situation where the child should or can lead, the he may become unsettled, disappointed, or frustrated  with  a  role  of  diminished  power,  and  react negatively.

Parental expression of anger, whether or not it is directed toward the child, is associated with: decreased amounts and quality of  child  play  and  exploration;  child  avoidance  of  the parent;  increased  periods  of  the  child's  negative  emotions  (e.g.,  sadness,  fear,  anger);  and  deterioration  of child behavior (Teti and Cole 2011).\nChildren  are  strongly  influenced  by  their  parents' methods of emotional expression (Thompson 1994). The type and intensity of parent emotional expression provides a model for a child to imitate. Constructive, upbeat expressivity  and  support  from  the  parents  have  been found to relate positively to children's constructive coping with daily stress. Mothers with negative dominant expressions have children with lower levels of constructive  coping.  Witnessing  or  being  the  target  of  hostile negative emotions is stressful at any age, and children have limited life experience and capacity to withstand, process, and cope with such stress. Evidence that children's constructive coping is positively related to parental supportive strategies is mounting. It is possible that parents who express emotion in positive ways are more likely to insist that children manage and control their emotions in socially appropriate ways in stressful situations and/or teach them constructive ways of coping (Valiente et al. 2004)."

Effective parent responses have been found to be problemand emotion-focused and express encouragement.  Unhelpful  parent  behaviors  include minimizing, punitive, and distressed responses to their children's  emotions.  High  levels  of  family  chaos  have been found to be associated with lower levels of effective parent responses (Valiente et al. 2007).\nThe  terms  'emotional  contagion'  and  'emotional attunement' describe the observation that a person's emotions are highly influenced by the emotions expressed  by  those  around  them,  and  there  is  a  tendency for individuals in proximity to emotionally converge.  Emotions  are  shared  in  multiple  ways,  subtly and overtly, verbally and non-verbally. Research using functional magnetic resonance imaging has found that observing  another  individual's  emotions  and  facial expressions activates regions of the brain which 1)  experience  similar  emotions  and  2)  produce  facial muscle activation and mimicry (Morrison et al. 2004). A simple example is that when someone smiles at us, we reflexively smile back. Due to the negative bias of the human brain to detect potential threats, it is easier to become upset and distressed by someone else's negative emotional expression than it is to become happy and  relaxed  by  someone  else's  joy  and  contentment. Emotional  contagion  theory  explains  how  ambient mood  states  of  both  parties  influence  parent-child interactions. A child in a positive mood is more likely to  comply with a mother's requests (Lay et al. 1989). A mother who is angry, even for reasons unrelated to her  child,  is  more  likely  to  believe  that  interactions with her child will be unpleasant and require a stern approach (Dix 1991)."

Parenting affects children's behavior most strongly during early childhood (Slagt et al. 2012) while problematic adolescent behavior strongly affects  parenting  (Reitz et al. 2006). Parental sense of competence is defined as a parent's opinion of her ability to positively influence the behavior and development of her child (Coleman and Karraker 1998).\nSocial relations theory views children as active agents in their interactions with parents and assumes that disagreements, conflicts and changes occur frequently. It is developmentally normal for children to resist some of the socialization demands of their   parents (Goh and Kuczynski  2009). A  parent's  philosophy  of  parenting (style)  and  behaviors (parenting practices) will determine the degree of parent accommodation and submission to the natural resistance of the child. It has been observed that a child's status and power is higher in single-child  homes.  China  introduced  its  One-Child Policy  in  1979,  resulting  in  a  generation  of  children and young adults without siblings or cousins. Most of these  solitary  children  are  the  focus  of  interest  for  six adults:  two  parents  and  four  grandparents  (Goh  and Kuczynski  2009).  Chinese  parents  and  teachers  have used the term xiao huangdi ,  meaning 'little emperor,' to describe pampered and entitled children who have inflated  views  of  their  own  status  and  importance. Both teachers and employers have observed that many One-Child-Policy  babies  never  learned  how  to  cope with  disappointment  and  frustration  in  ways  that would  best  prepare  them  for  life  outside  the  home (Cameron et al. 2013)."

    "context_enriched_content": "sibling influences\nThroughout life, the sibling relationship may be cooperative,  ambivalent,  or  antagonistic.  The  child  grows  and develops within a dynamic and variable family context across time. Multiple studies have confirmed that families  differentially  distribute  such  resources  as  parental time, attention, money, nurturance, and love among the children in a family. Parents tend to concentrate resources on some children and not on others. Parent resource inequity between siblings has been examined based on birth order,  child  gender,  sibling  gender,  birth  spacing,  and birth  intention  (wanted  versus  unwanted  pregnancy). Unintended children have been found to receive fewer parent resources than intended siblings (Barber and East 2009). Unwanted children are more likely to receive critical, punitive, abusive, and/or neglectful parenting (Barber et al. 1999). Inequitable treatment by parents has been found to have significant long-term negative effects on the adjustment and self-esteem of the slighted child. (McGuire et al. 1995; Volling and Elins, 1998).\nThe sibling relationship is known to be a key part of the developmental context of a child's socialization, yet the  complex  interactions  between  siblings  are  only partially understood. The birth or adoption of a brother or sister is a normal life event for many children. Freud and  others  have  proposed  that  the  changes  in  home environment, family composition, family function, and parental attention resulting from a new baby (or newly adopted child) cause a developmental crisis for many children.  Some  are  extremely  jealous,  have  behavioral regressions,  or  display  tantrums  or  disruptive  behaviors; other children display minimal behavioral changes. A  review  of  studies  considering  firstborn  children's reactions to the birth of a sibling found that the child's developmental level contributes to psychological adjustment during the transition to siblinghood. Skills newly acquired in the weeks and months immediately preceding a sibling's birth (e.g., toilet training, weaning from bottle) appear more vulnerable to regression than behaviors  that  are  better  established  and  part  of  the child's routine (Volling 2012).\nChildren  in the  same  family  do  not  experience identical  environments.  Common  variations  are  the state  of  the  parent  relationship,  parent-child  temperament fit or misfit, family social and economic circumstances,  and  parent-child  interactions.  Sibling  rivalry begins early. Twelve-month-old infants and young children are sensitive to maternal attention directed toward a  newborn  infant,  sibling,  or  unfamiliar  peer  (Volling et  al.  2002).  Arrival  of  an  infant  has  been  found  to adversely affect mother-to-older-sibling interactions with  decreased  maternal  attention,  positive  affection, and attachment security, and often results in confrontations with the older child. It is theorized that increased behavior  problems  of  the  older  child  are  mediated through changes in the mother-child relationship, particularly  through  increases  in  the  mother's  use  of physical discipline (Volling 2005)."

The child patient may show signs of stress in their new role and behave in a negative way to capture their parent's attention. The goal should be to keep the focus and nurturing of the dental team directed toward  the  child  patient,  rather  than  on  the  newest family  member  and  parent.  The  child  patient  can  be invited to introduce his new sibling to the dentist or staff member. Examples of child-focused responses are: 'It is nice to meet your new sister, but today, you are the special one!' and 'This is a very lucky baby to have you for their own big brother!'\nWhen the dentist is caring for children from a family with  inequitable  distribution  of  parent  resources,  the dental team can advocate for the less-favored child. The attention and nurturing of the team should be directed entirely  toward  the  child  patient.  Comments  such  as 'Parents with more than one child continually need to shift attention between them. Right now I'd like both of us to focus on (name of child), and decide together how we can  (give  compliment),  (describe  concern),  (request resource  allocation)'  will  nudge  the  parent's  attention toward the more overlooked child. When the dentist is successful in proactively directing the parent's attention towards  the  habitually  slighted  child,  the  child  patient will  not  need  to  escalate  behavior  during  the  appointment to capture and sustain their parent's interest."

Family systems researchers readily acknowledge the many limitations inherent in describing, quantifying,  evaluating  the  network  of  relationships within  any  family.  Family  functioning  models  are  the work  of  many  and  have  evolved  over  time.  One  frequently used model of family functioning includes three common  family  profiles  to  classify  the  emotional  and relational qualities of the family. This family functioning typology and child security outcomes as summarized by Davies et al. (2004) follows:\n- Cohesive family. Warm, close, and harmonious family relationships. Discrete but flexible boundaries separate relationships and family members. Autonomy of family members is respected.\n- Enmeshed or chaotic family. High levels of conflict and hostility. Discordant and/or weak boundaries within  and  across  family  relationships.  Enmeshed family  processes  emotionally  pull  children  into adult family problems.\n- Disengaged or separate family. Emotionally cold relationships  with  high  levels  of  adversity  and low levels of support. Rigid boundaries between and within parent-co-parent and parent-child relationships.\nChild security and psychological functioning have been examined in the context of family functioning by many investigators. Children in cohesive families exhibit high levels of attachment security, constructive coping, and psychological  adjustment,  and  are  thought  to  be  at lower risk for psychological adjustment problems. In a one-year study of kindergarten-age children and their families, children from both enmeshed and disengaged families had decreased security and were at increased risk  for  psychological  difficulties  and  maladjustment when  compared  to  children  from  cohesive  families (Davies et al. 2004)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parent influence on Child Coping and Cooperation in Medical settings\nDentists have much to learn from parent-child research from colleagues in pediatric medicine. In pediatric medicine, patient- and family-centered care is based on the understanding  that  the  family  is  the  child's  primary source  of  support  and  that  their  perspectives  and information are important in clinical decision-making. Family inclusion has become the standard for pediatric medical practice for procedures ranging from venipuncture to anesthesia induction  and  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (American Academy  of  Pediatrics  Policy Statement  2012).  In  recent  decades,  areas  of  research which have explored the influences exerted by the social environment  on  children  undergoing  painful  medical treatment  include:  impact  of  parental  presence  versus absence, interviews with children regarding their preferences  for  help  during  stressful  medical  procedures, and  efforts  to  assess  the  impact  of  adult  behaviors on  children's  coping  or  distress  reactions.  Some  of these  findings  can  be  applied  to  the  dental  situation. Separation of the child from the parent during a painful medical procedure is unacceptable to most parents, and most children indicate a preference for parents to be present (Gonzalez et al. 1989). Family presence during medical procedures decreases anxiety for both the child and the  parents.  When  parents  are  prepared,  they  do  not prolong the procedure or make the provider more anxious (Blesch and Fisher 1996; Wolfram and Turner, 1996; Powers and Rubenstein, 1999; Dingeman et al. 2007). In a  systematic  review  by  Piira  et  al.  (2005),  multiple studies confirmed that parents were more positive about treatment when they were with their child during invasive  procedures.  Blount  and  various  coauthors  have developed, revised, and created a shortened form of a Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale (Blount et al. 1989, Blount et al. 1991, Blount et al. 2001). The  CAMPIS  scales  include  categories  for  both  child and adult behaviors, and each participant is scored separately. The child's procedural distress and coping, and the various adults' behaviors that significantly influence the  distress  of  children,  are  included  in  the  CAMPIS measures. Adult  actions  or  comments  which  improve child  coping  and  cooperation  are  termed  'CopingPromoting'  and  adult  actions  or  comments  which worsen the child's coping and cooperation are termed 'Distress-Promoting.'\nResearch using the CAMPIS, CAMPIS-R(Revised), and CAMPIS-SF(Short Form) leads to the conclusion that the number of adult Distress Promoting behaviors exceeds the number of Coping Promoting behaviors, and that many of the most common parent behaviors are counterproductive\nin helping the child to accept and cope with an uncomfortable medical procedure. Examples of Distress Promoting behaviors are:\n- Uninformative reassuring comments : 'I won't let them hurt you.' 'Don't worry.'\n- Informative reassuring comments : 'You're almost done.' 'Just two more minutes.'\n- Giving control to child : 'Do you want to put this mask on?' 'Can we start now?'\n- Criticism :  'You  are  in  a  bad  mood  today.'  'Why can't you be like your sister?'\n- Apology :  'I'm sorry this is taking so long.' 'I wish they didn't have to hurt you.'\n- Empathy :  'I  know  it  hurts.'  'You  must  be  getting tired.'\n- Suggestions or demands to the healthcare provider : 'He does better when he knows what is going to happen.'  'When  she  gets  upset,  if  you'll  stop  for  a moment, she'll calm down.'\n- Intimidation : 'I'm going to slap you.' 'You are seriously going to harm yourself.'\n- Inappropriate  or  confusing  comments :  'You  can  do anything but move.' 'He's going to try to not hurt you.'"

Children may perceive that their parents are  fearful  when  they  reassure.  The  facial  expression, vocal  tone,  and  verbal  content  of  adult-to-child  messages  are  influential  but  incompletely  understood  for children during these procedures. Reassurance may tell the child that the situation is concerning and may direct attention to unpleasant aspects of the procedure (Chorney  et  al.  2009,  McMurtry  et  al.  2010).  Four independent, randomized, controlled trials with differing methodologies have confirmed increased amounts of child distress associated with adult emotionfocused behaviors including reassurance, empathy, and empathic  touch  during  painful  stimuli  ranging  from injections, to cold-pressor, to abdominal pain (Chambers et al. 2002; Walker et al. 2006).\nChildren  displaying  a  high  proportion  of  coping behaviors  have  been  found  to  be  less  distressed,  less fearful, experience less pain, and be more approaching, cooperative, and easily helped. Child coping and cooperation is positively related with the proportion of parent Coping Promoting behaviors, although the association is much weaker than the relationship of parent  Distress  Promoting  behaviors  to  a  child's  lack  of coping.  Examples  of  parent  actions  and  comments found to be Coping Promoting are:\n- Non-procedural conversation with the child which redirects their attention to something pleasant :  Conversation about  pets,  toys,  food,  movies,  television,  friends. Conversation  about  the  child's  plans  or  desires. Familiar and well-loved stories.\n- Prompt or command for child to use a coping strategy : 'Use your deep breathing now.' 'Squeeze my hand as hard as you can.'\n- Humor  directed  to  engage  the  child  and  improve  their mood : Silly jokes, such as 'What is gray, weighs two tons, and puts people to sleep? A Hypnopotamus!' Any  statement  that  suggests  outrageous  ideas  or emphasizes humorous aspects of a situationalthough not at the child's expense. (See Chapter Six for further use of humor in the dental setting.)\n- Reframing  and  reinterpreting  the  situation,  equipment and  procedures :  Presenting  procedures  and  equipment as something fun, positive, manageable and understandable. 'Let's play the astronaut game' is an example of reframing presentation of an oxygen mask.\nParents'  happy  facial  expressions  and  rising  vocal tones  were  interpreted  positively  by  children  in  one study (McMurtry et al. 2010). Giving parents training improves their  effectiveness  in  helping  their  child  to cope (Blount et al. 1994). Parent coaching is a component of the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) package currently considered a 'well-established treatment' to manage procedure-related pain in children and adolescents."

Adult  behaviors  which direct  the  child's  attention  to  their  emotions  promote distress  and  poor  coping;  adult  behaviors  which  distract the child have the opposite result. Distress of the child is more strongly correlated with parent's behavior than  with  the  behavior  of  the  healthcare  provider. Coping by the child is more strongly influenced by the healthcare  provider's  behavior  than  by  their  parent's behavior.  (Cohen  et  al.  2002;  Chorney  et  al.  2009; Mahoney  et  al.  2010).

In contrast to reported increases in general anxiety,  the  prevalence  of  dental  fear  in  adults  remained stable in studies conducted in the United States between 1954 and 2000 (Smith and Heaton 2003). Child dental\nanxiety  is  associated  with  the  parent's  own  anxiety. Social  learning  theory  predicts  that  siblings  and  other family members may create or feed dental anxiety via overt or subtle means. Negative attitudes toward dental care  in  the  family  are  reportedly  common  reasons  for developing dental fear. Some fearful adults report that their anxiety started in childhood, and in some instances the  anxiety  preceded  their  first  dental  visit  (Berggren and Meynert 1984, Locker et al. 1991).\nIn  theory,  a  parent  with  dental  anxiety  could  avoid instilling dental fear in their child. The parent could be prepared with education about the safety and comfort of modern dentistry, and coached to consciously, continuously, and carefully monitor their emotional expressions and  comments  about  dentistry.  Methods  for  parental education are provided in the pre-appointment behavior modification section in Chapter Six.

    "context_enriched_content": "Parent Presence or Absence in the Dental Operatory\nFamily inclusion has become the standard in pediatric medicine, and dental surveys examining parent presence and absence during treatment reflect a similar cultural change in pediatric dentistry (Adair et al. 2004). A clear majority of parents, 66 to 97%, prefer to stay with their child during dental treatment, as reported by investigators in the United States, India, Ireland, Israel, and Saudi Arabia (Kamp 1992; Peretz and Zadik, 1998; Arathi and Ashwani, 1999; Crowely et al. 2005). A  large  study  of fathers and mothers in Saudi Arabia found that parents most strongly wanted to be present in situations where their  child  expressed  fear  prior  to  the  dental  visit (Abushal and Adenubi 2009).\nAdvantages  associated  with  parent  presence  in  the operatory have been reported for the child, parent, and dentist. The proximity of a parent apparently offers the child increased emotional security and support. Parents report higher satisfaction and peace of mind that they are protecting and supporting their child, and are presumed to benefit from hearing the dental health messages given to their children by caring dental providers. The  dentist  may  benefit  from  improved  cooperation from  the  emotionally  supported  child  and  ability  to build a trusting relationship with the parent as they provide care to the child (Venham et al. 1978; Wright et al. 1983; Pinkham, 1991; Marcum et al. 1995; Feigal, 2001; American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2012).\nDisadvantages of parental presence in the operatory have  also  been  reported.  Most  problems  are  created due to division of attention. The child's attention is split between  parent  and  dentist  and  they  may  not  know which adult to listen to. No investigator has found that a parent's repetition of a dentist's instructions improves child cooperation. When the parent contradicts the dentist,  the  child  will  become  confused.  Wright  observed that parents who take an active and verbal role in the operatory disrupt the interaction between the child and the  dentist,  increasing  potential  for  more  child  noncooperation (1983). The dentist may become distracted or annoyed by a talkative parent, feeling compelled to simultaneously  attend  to  child  behaviors  and  parent concerns and behaviors while performing a procedure. If the parent has high dental anxiety, being in the dental operatory can amplify their negative emotions, which are then transmitted to the child. Fearful parents may directly interfere with dental treatment of their child by interrupting  treatment,  questioning  the  dentist's  techniques,  or  relating  their  own  negative  experiences. Klingberg et al. (2009) observed that an anxious parent serves as a live and powerful negative model of dental anxiety to their child. Some dentists may be reluctant to use  accepted  behavior  management  techniques  in  the presence of a parent (Wright et al. 1983; Marcum et al. 1995; American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2012).\nA randomized, controlled trial examining the effect of parent presence in the operatory, patient age, and patient dental  anxiety  was  conducted  in  a  pediatric  dentistry clinic in The Netherlands. Ninety patients, ages four to eight years, had a habituation dental appointment followed by a treatment session on another day. Dentists found that the child's behavior was significantly better during  habituation  appointments  when  parents  were not present in the operatory. Parents and dentists agreed that dentally anxious children cooperated better during treatment when the parent was not present. Dentists in the study reported disadvantages when parents of anxious  children  were  present  in  the  operatory.  Parental presence  or  absence  did  not  significantly  affect  the child's perception of the treatment (Cox et al. 2011)."

An investigation  in  the  United  States  evaluated  parents' compliance  with  instructions  to  remain  silent  in  the operatory while their four- to nine- year-old-children received restorative dentistry. Thirty-nine parents were randomized into two groups: written instruction only or written and verbal instruction. Most parents (82%) remained silent, and there were no significant associations found between the modality of the request to be silent  and  parent  compliance.  A  few  parents  (10%) interrupted  the  appointment  multiple  times;  in  all  of these cases the child had a history of previous dental restorations (Jain et al. 2013).\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's Clinical Guideline: Behavior Guidance  for the Pediatric Patient includes  parent  presence  or  absence  in  the  operatory among the methods for  establishing  effective  dentistchild communication. 239 parents of children ages one to fifteen completed surveys at the beginning and end of their  children's  appointments  for  preventive,  restorative,  oral  surgery  or  orthodontic  care.  Parents  who showed consistency in their desires to be either present or absent and their actual experience during the appointment were more satisfied and positive about their child's appointment  than  parents  who  showed  inconsistency. As patients were younger, the desire of parents to remain with their children increased (Kim et al. 2012).\nKupietzky  et  al.  (2013)  introduced  and  validated  a Parent  Cooperation  Scale  (PCS)  to  categorize  parent behaviors and assess a parent's ability to be a constructive, supportive influence on their child during dental treatment. The PCS is analogous to the Frankl scale for rating child behaviors, with four groups of parent behaviors:\n- PCS  1. Definitely  negative  (refusal  of  treatment plan, suspicious of dentist, overprotective of child);\n- PCS  2. Negative  (some  evidence  of  negative  attitude,  needs  to  see  caries  on  radiographs,  acts  as liaison between patient and dentist);\n- PCS 3. Positive  (accepting  of  treatment  plan,  cautious behavior at times, reluctantly allows child to be alone with dentist);\n- PCS 4. Definitely positive (trustful, expresses confidence  in  dentist,  allows  patient  to  be  alone with dental staff).\nA study of 244 children and parents found a significant association between parent PCS scores and the Frankl scores of their children. Parents with negative behavior were more likely to present with children who had negative dental behavior, and positive parents were more likely to have cooperative children.\nIn summary, a negative, distrustful, or intrusive parent is  a  disruptive  influence  in  the  dental  operatory,  even when the parent is well-intentioned. The child's awareness of and attunement to their parent's negative emotional state undermines their ability to listen, relate, and respond  to  the  dentist  positively.  For  each  child-parent pair,  the  risk  and  benefit  of  parent  presence  during treatment should be considered, and a proactive decision should be made and respectfully explained to the parent."

    "context_enriched_content": "Influence of Parenting Style\nPediatric dentists surveyed in 2001 perceived a change in American parenting styles during the last decades of the 20 th  century. Families shifted away from traditional family hierarchies with the parent in charge, moving toward a more permissive and democratic family style. In families  with  permissive  parenting  styles,  child misbehavior  does  not  necessarily  result  in  negative consequences for the child. The dentists also reported increases in single-parent families, family  mobility, and  dual-income  families.  The  vast  majority  of  dentists  believed  that  these  family  changes  had  resulted in  somewhat  or  much  worse  child  patient  cooperation  during  dental  treatment.  Simultaneously  with declining patient cooperation, parent expectations (e.g., no crying) for their child's dental appointments were often  inflated  and  not  achievable  (Casamasimo and Wilson 2002).\nAn investigation of many variables relating to child cooperation  for  dental  treatment  found  that  parentreported frequency of difficult child behaviors by three to  twelve-year-olds  outside  the  dental  setting  did  not predict  the  child's  disruptiveness  during  treatment. Young patient age was the best predictor of uncooperative behavior. Uncooperative behavior during the dental appointment also correlated with parents who set few limits  and  were  relaxed  and  supportive  of  their  child (Allen et al. 2003).\nA study of the relationships between parenting style, parent behavior during the appointment, child cooperation with dental treatment, and behavior management techniques used by the dentist was reported by Aminabadi and Farahani (2007). Seventy-two children ages four to six and their parents were videotaped while the child received an inferior alveolar block and amalgam restoration of a mandibular molar. Parent style was classified by using typology of Baumrind, as well as Maccoby  and  Martin,  which  was  described  earlier  in this chapter.\nParents with an Authoritative style (high warmth and firm behavior controls) primarily observed the treatment (69%)  and  also  rewarded,  verbally  encouraged,  and explained.  Most  of  their  children  (81%)  expressed  no discomfort during treatment, while others (19%) showed mild discomfort.\nParents with a Permissive style (high warmth and low behavior controls) exhibited vastly different behaviors: 74% had physical contact with their child, 70% stopped treatment at least once, 50% questioned the efficacy of the local anesthesia, and only 7% observed without participating further.  All  children  were  uncomfortable during  treatment,  with  44%  expressing  moderate  discomfort and 56% expressing severe discomfort.\nFewer parents had an Authoritarian style (low warmth and high behavior control), and 100% of these took physical control of their child 'with firmness and displeasure.' All children of Authoritarian parents were uncomfortable; 38% showed moderate discomfort and 62% showed severe discomfort.\nThere were no parents with the Neglectful style (low warmth and low behavior control) in the study.\nThis study provides support for the view that parent behaviors which distract the child from the dentist or undermine the authority of the dentist are destructive to the  dentist-child  relationship.  It  provides  additional support for the concept of the parent's role as a 'silent observer' when in the dental operatory with their child.\nOne hundred children ages four to twelve who were referred to a specialized pediatric dentistry clinic in the Netherlands due to uncooperative behavior were analyzed  with  their  parents  for  the  relationship  between child dental anxiety, level of cooperation for treatment, and their parents' style of parenting. Pre-treatment parent expectations of the dentist's effectiveness in managing their child's behavior significantly differed by parenting  style.  Authoritarian  parents  more  strongly expected that their child's behavior could be managed by the dentist; Permissive and Neglectful parents had less confidence in the dentist. In this study, parents were not  present  in  the  dental  operatory  during  treatment. Parenting style was not found to be related to the child's pre-treatment dental anxiety or to the child's cooperation during the treatment. Highly anxious children were more  disruptive  than  less  anxious  children.  Parents showed more confidence in  the  child-dentist  relationship after the completion of their child's dental treatment and expressed a lower need to accompany their child into the dental operatory (Krikken and Verrkamp 2008)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Influence of Parenting Style\nA  survey  of  parents  of  four-  to  twelve-  year-old children  examined  association  between  child  dental anxiety and parenting style. Parenting style was categorized  for  331  parents  of  children  referred  to  specialty pediatric  dentistry  clinics  due  to  non-cooperation  and for  120  parents whose children had not been referred. Child age and child dental anxiety were also examined. Parenting  style  did  not  correlate  to  a  child's  referred versus  non-referred  status.  No  correlation  was  found between  children's  dental  anxiety  and  their  parents' styles of parenting. Referred children were significantly younger  than  non-referred  children,  and  had  significantly more dental anxiety (Krikken et al. 2012)."

A  study  of  273  threeyear-old  children  found  that  parents  were  accurate  in predicting a negative reaction from their child to introductory dental procedures such as sitting in the dental chair  and  allowing  the  explorer  against  the  fingernail and  a  tooth.  The  child's  anxiety  when  meeting  new people also predicted cooperation (Holst et al. 1993)."

Parents will  readily  share  information  about  their  personal dental attitudes, parenting styles, and desires to be present or absent during their children's treatment if they are  asked  about  these  factors  in  a  private,  thoughtful, and respectful conversation with the dentist."

    "context_enriched_content": "Dentist and Parent Communication\nOver the past several decades, the nature of health care delivery has shifted from a paternalistic, 'doctor is the authority'  model  to  a  more  egalitarian  model  where patients and families expect to participate in treatment decisions and health care delivery. The health and welfare of the child should be the primary focus for both parent and dentist. The role of the dentist is to provide parents with the risk and benefit information needed to make an informed decision and to correct any misinformation the parent may have. The role of the parent is to receive and process this information and make a choice for the child. Dentists may need to accept decisions they disagree with if those decisions are not likely to be harmful to the child (Diekema 2005).\nThe dentist should listen attentively and respectfully to the parent's concerns, recognizing that parents may not  use  the  same  decision  criteria  as  the  dentist.  One dentist will not be an ideal match for every child and family. When distrust develops or significant differences in philosophy of care exist, the child and family should be directed to another dentist and/or clinic.\nWright  and  Stigers  (2011)  suggest  incorporating  a 'functional  inquiry'  about  child  behaviors  into  the initial patient health  history.  Brief  questions  about the child's past cooperation in the medical setting, the child's perception of his dental health or dental problem, the parent's own dental anxiety, and the parent's prediction of child cooperation for dental care will guide the dentist  toward  understanding  both  the  child  and  her parent. Knowledge of the child and parental concerns allows the dentist to more accurately predict a child's ability to cooperate. The functional inquiry is discussed in greater detail in Chapter Six.\nIt is natural for dentists and parents to take their cues from each other as they interact with the child during a dental appointment. Therefore, even brief interventions which prepare the parent to support their child without disrupting the child-dentist relationship may be beneficial.  Educational  materials  for  parents  and  families explaining the different types of coping strategies with\nbrief examples can be posted on the office website and made available in the office. Box 4.1 offers helpful hints for parents."

    "context_enriched_content": "summary\nFamilies establish styles of interacting between family members and with the world outside the family long before reaching a dental office. Social circumstances and family patterns of behavior may prepare a child to be more or less accepting of dental treatment. The dentist should  mindfully  assess  the  dynamics  between  new patients and their parents or caregivers before deciding how  best  to  guide  them  through  the  dental  appointment. Early attention to a family's situation, style, and preferences will allow the dentist to gain the trust of the parent  and  earn  the  opportunity  to  form  a  positive, long-term relationship with the child."

    "context_enriched_content": "establishing a Dental home Chapter 5\nAnna B. Fuks\nAri Kupietzky\nThe  recognition  of  and  treatment  for  Early  Childhood Caries  (ECC)  has  been  a  major  concern  for  the  dental profession. Indeed, concerns about the dental treatment directed toward infants were reported at the beginning of the twentieth century (Cunha et al. 2000), and surveys have shown that caries in primary teeth have increased for  two-  to  five-year-olds  (Dye  2007).  To  combat  this form of early dental caries, pediatric dentists in the 1980s began recommending that dental examinations for children should commence at one year of age or earlier.\nEducation, a less costly alternative, also has been a focus in solving the ECC problem. One of the earliest centers for delivering an educational program was the Baby Clinic, established  in  1986  at  the  Londrina  State  University  in Brazil. The aim of the Baby Clinic was to provide education to parents and to maintain or re-establish a good oral health status, creating a positive attitude in parents and children toward dentistry (Cunha et al. 2000). Education for improving oral health starts very early, and lectures on prevention  of  oral  diseases  are  included  in  prenatal delivery preparation courses for parents (Soderling et al. 2000;  Casamassimo  2001).  A  similar  model  was  introduced in the United States and termed the Dental Home. This relatively new concept, with its prevention potential, has  been  included  in  the  Guidelines  of  the  American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (2010). Reports describing new programs indicate the profession's acceptance of this approach, and indeed, an entire book has been published recently on infant dentistry (Berg and Slayton 2009).\nThis chapter approaches the dental home from a different  viewpoint-the  patient  management  perspective.  How  can  the  dental  home  have  an  impact  on future child dental behavior  and  the relationship between the pediatric dentist and parent? The chapter also  presents  the  technical  aspects  of  examining  and managing a one-year-old child, the recommended age to  establish  a  dental  home.  The  management  of  a one-year-old presents the clinician with entirely different circumstances as compared to older children. Although there is only a year separating a one-year-old from  a  two-year-old  child,  there  are  great  cognitive, physical, and dental differences (see Chapter Two).\nAll of the patient management techniques discussed in the  preceding  and  following  chapters  have  in  common the need for effective communicative management. This leads to the conclusion that there is a need for a congenial relationship. Proper patient management and treatment can be achieved in a friendly, familiar environment. This concept has been labeled the 'medical home' by our pediatric medical colleagues. The medical home concept was introduced  by  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  in 1967. At the time it was envisioned as a central source for all the medical information about a child. It focused primarily on those with special needs and in low socioeconomic groups, as underprivileged children were seeking basic medical treatment in hospital emergency rooms. In 1992  the  concept  was  expanded  and  the  medical  home was defined as a strategy for delivering the family-centered, comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated care for  all  infants  and  children.  In  2002,  the  organization further extended  and  operationalized  the definition, including  the  requirement  that  each  patient  have  an ongoing relationship with a personal physician trained to provide first contact and continuous, comprehensive care. The medical home is now applied to all children and suggests that a strategy be developed that ensures a familiar health care provider for each family. This concept argues for a place that does not change each year with the vagaries of the third-party payment system, governmental support, or practitioner market. The strategy worked: studies show that the medical home public health model allows appropriate care to be initiated more often in the primary care center  than  in  the  emergency  room.  Furthermore,  it  is associated with better preventive health, higher levels of disease management, and lower resource utilization and costs (Devries et al. 2012, Hearld and Alexander 2012)."

    "context_enriched_content": "establishing a Dental home Chapter 5\nThe guideline on infant oral care was adopted by the American  Academy  of  Pediatric  Dentistry  (AAPD)  in 2001.  In  2010,  the AAPD  reaffirmed  its  'Policy  on  the Dental Home,' describing it as inclusive of all aspects of oral health that result from the interaction of the patient, parents,  non-dental,  and  dental  professionals.  Also  in 2010,  the  AAPD  reaffirmed  its  definition  of  the  term, calling it 'the ongoing relationship between the dentist and the patient, inclusive of all aspects of oral health care delivered in a comprehensive, continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way. Establishment of a  dental  home  begins  by  twelve  months  of  age  and includes referral to dental specialists when appropriate'\nFigure 5-1. The pediatric dental triangle founded under ideal circumstances: during  the  establishment  of  a  dental  home  at  age  one.  Courtesy  of  Dr.  Ari Kupietzky.\nFigure 5-2. The pediatric dental triangle established under less-than-ideal circumstances:  an  emergency  first-time  dental  visit.  Courtesy  of  Dr.  Ari Kupietzky.\n(AAPD reference manual 2012). This concept supports a place where all families feel they will be welcomed for regular, comprehensive care and where they are understood  and  valued.  Empirical  evidence  suggests  great value  to  a  long  relationship  with  child  patients  as  it allows additional learning and reframing of experiences after  difficult  procedures.  This  can  only  occur  if  the family  has  a  comfortable  relationship  with  the  dental home. The present alternative is a system that leads to episodic and emergency care (Feigal 2001).\nIn  a  familiar  and  welcoming  environment,  relationships can be made that ease the stress of health care for children.  A  dental  home  enhances  the  likelihood  of establishing parental compliance with early and regular care. It is a cornerstone of prevention in dentistry, and it is much more likely to lead to better child acceptance of dental procedures.\nA major goal of the dental home concept is the prevention  of  ECC.  Although  not  yet  substantiated  by research, researchers and clinicians state that the benefits of the dental home are substantial and intuitive with an  increasing  emphasis  on  disease  prevention  and management,  advancements  in  tailoring  care  to  meet individual needs, and better health outcomes (Nowak and Casamassimo 2008). The benefits of the dental home include early dental attendance and preventive services, resulting in lower future treatment costs, and a decrease in  more  invasive,  complex  dental  treatments  (Doykos 1997,  Savage  et  al.  2004).  Untreated  dental  problems may lead to hospitalization and expose children to additional  health  risks  associated  with  conscious  sedation and general anesthesia (Newacheck et al. 2000). However,  among  the  non-tangible  advantages  of  this approach to dental care is the fact that a dental home established early in life may also reduce children's anxiety or fear of dental care. This is the reason for including this chapter in a book devoted to patient management. Again, the emphasis is on the prevention of disease.\nWith introspect one may conclude that establishing a dental home is simply the early foundation of a healthy, balanced,  stable,  and  harmonious  pediatric  dental  triangle (see Figure 5-1). The first year visit provides ideal conditions for development of the dentist-parent-child relationship. The child is free of pain and the accompanying parent is free of stress and anxiety. The healthy triangle has at its base the dentist and parent acting as a foundation for the apex of the triangle: the child. The dental team and parent are team members, on the same side  of  the  triangle  supporting  the  child  through  the dental  experience.  Conversely,  when  a  two-year-old child appears at the dentist for the first time with ECC and  possibly  pain,  the  pediatric  dental  triangle  is  far from ideal (see Figure 5-2). Many parents are filled with"

As the dentist explains the cause of the disease and discusses the treatment options many parents  take  on  the  role  of  child  protector.  The dental team is then situated on one side of the triangle opposite the child and parent. The dental team, bearing the  weight  and  balancing  force  of  the  unstable  and fragile triangle is at a disadvantage. The early establishment of the dental home allows the avoidance of such an unfavorable start."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 5.1\nMrs. G. telephoned a pediatric dentist's office to make a first-time appointment for her thirteen-month-old daughter. The receptionist sensed much hesitation in the mother's voice. 'My friend told me that I should bring Kayla in for an appointment. But when I asked my dentist at what age to start with my daughter's dental appointments, he told me not before four or five years old! I was wondering how the dentist would get Kayla to open her mouth. She gives us trouble when taking a bath and even I, as her mom, can't brush her teeth.'\nThe  receptionist  reassured  her  that  Dr. Ann  and  the entire  staff  have  much  experience  dealing  with  young children, even younger than Kayla. She told Mrs. G. that a pediatric dentist is similar to a pediatrician and will be able to help Mrs. G and Kayla through the visit. Mrs. G made the appointment.\nCase 5.1, Discussion : The receptionist is the first contact with the dental office, and in this case needed to reassure  the  mother  that  bringing  in  her  child  for  the one-year visit was the right thing to do. It is clear how important it is for Kayla to establish a dental home. Her mother mentioned on the phone that Kayla is not getting  proper  preventive  dental  care  at  home.  She  will need to be instructed on proper feeding habits, fluoride usage, and how to brush a young child's teeth. Her predicament  and  uncertainty  about  this  visit  is  typical, especially  if  Kayla  is  her  first  child.  Contradicting information  regarding  the  proper  timing  for  the  first dental  visit  is  widespread  in  the  dental  profession. Referral from a pediatrician or family doctor lends more credibility  to  the  concept.  Many  general  dentists  give parents misinformation either out of ignorance or perhaps  because  they  themselves  cannot  manage  a  very young  child  and  therefore  do  not  comprehend  the validity of such an early dental visit. Having a website explaining  much  of  the  above  helps  alleviate  parents' initial anxieties.\nAlthough  the  dental  home  concept  was  introduced more than ten years ago, a 2011 survey of parent leaders confirmed that the majority of parents are not aware of it  (Kagihara  et  al.  2011).  The  majority  of  respondents (84.8%) said parents do not know about the recommendation  to  establish  a  dental  home  for  their  child  by twelve months of age. They elaborated on their answers with comments including the following:\n- 'I  just  learned  this  (age-1  dental  visit  concept) myself within the last week-and I'm supposedly in the loop.'\n- 'Some families need to be informed. Other families tell  us  that  they  have  attempted  to  get  that  oral health screening from their dentist at age one and have been turned away because the dentist did not follow this as the standard of care.'\n- 'Many believe they can wait until either the child starts school or they lose their baby teeth.'\n- 'No way! Age three is what we always heard!'\n- 'Yes, but if the child is chronically ill, other health issues often come first and many children who do not feed by mouth are often taken to the dentist later because of other health complications.'\n- 'Not at all, as oral health care is not considered a priority in light of other medical diagnoses a child might have, and because most families don't think baby teeth are important.'\nDespite the AAPD's recommendation that all children have a dental visit following the eruption of the first tooth or no later than twelve months of age, changes within the dental profession have been slow. In 1997, approximately  73%  of  AAPD  members  surveyed agreed with the policy, but only 47% reported performing  evaluations  on  children  twelve  months old  or  younger  (Erickson  and  Thomas  1997).  Many pediatric dentists had not accepted the AAPD Policy on  the  Dental  Home,  nor  did  they  perform  infant oral evaluations  a  decade  after  the  initial  policy statement."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 5.1\nOver  the  last  decade,  AAPD  members'  attitudes and practices  have  improved significantly. A  recent survey  of  the  AAPD  membership  on  infant  oral health care beliefs revealed that 91% agreed with the policy, and 90% performed infant oral evaluations in their practice (Bubna et al. 2012). But there still seems to be a lingering doubt about the value of the dental home and early care. When the question was posed to Academy members in a different way, a large dis-\ncrepancy was revealed in   practitioners' beliefs in the AAPD policy. When asked at what age asymptomatic children  should  have  their  first  oral  health  evaluation, only 47% of respondents said by twelve months. When  practitioners  were  asked  why  they  did  not perform  infant  oral  evaluations  in  their  office,  several reasons were  noted. Surprisingly, the  most common reason was that practitioners felt the 'parents  do  not  see  the  value  of  the  infant  oral  evaluations.' The   second most commonly cited answer was that  '  existing  conditions  should  dictate  evaluation time.'\nThus, it seems that one of the major difficulties in establishing early prevention is getting support within the profession. Most caregivers have not been counseled on proper infant oral health care and the various  factors  that  contribute  to  dental  disease. Many parents are unaware that the inappropriate use of a baby bottle could result in harm to their child's developing dentition. How, then, is early education to be  dispensed  to  parents?  One  suggestion  made  by AAPD members is to educate pediatricians and primary care physicians about the value of early dental evaluations.  The  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics (AAP) has a policy which recommends that pediatric health  care  professionals  perform  oral  health  risk assessments on all patients beginning at six months, and  that  patients  who  are  at  risk  for  developing dental caries enter an 'aggressive anticipatory guidance  and  intervention  program  provided  by  a dentist between six and twelve months of age' (Hale 2003).\nAnother  equally  important  suggestion  made  by AAPD  members  was  to  educate  and  train  general dentists,  as  well  as  dental  students  and  residents, about infant oral health care and the establishment of a  dental  home.  Surveys  in  Iowa  and  Ohio  have revealed that fewer than 15% of dentists believe in or perform  infant  oral  examinations  (Wolfe  et  al.  2006; Siegal  and  Marx  2002)  and  few  general  dentists examine children younger than three years old (Seale and  Casamassimo  2003).  Currently,  undergraduate education in infant dentistry is lacking. The report of McWorter et al. (2001) on infant oral health education in U.S. dental school curricula found that the average didactic curricular time devoted to the topic of infant oral health is two hours and twenty minutes, and over half of the pre-doctoral programs provided no hands-on  experience  in  infant  oral  health  examinations. Since general dentists far outnumber pediatric dentists  and  ultimately  examine  the  majority  of  our nation's children, the recommendation  has  great importance."

She seated the mother in the dental chair with the child lying  backward  on  her.  Dr.  Sue  was  handed  a  mirror  to examine  the  child's  mouth  and  teeth  and  the  assistant adjusted the dental light. Joey refused to open his mouth. When the dentist forcibly opened his mouth, Joey started crying. The mother became very upset and interrupted the procedure. She accused Dr. Sue of not being patient and not knowing how to deal with her child. 'If you would have just explained to Joey why he needs to get his teeth checked he would not have cried. Joey understands everything. We never do anything to him without an explanation and his consent.'\nCase 5.2, Discussion : The child was placed in 'mommy wrap' position (in which the guardian lies on the chair and  wraps  her  arms  around  the  infant  or  toddler). While this position is commonly used with children by general practitioners, it is not the recommended position for examining toddlers. The mother lying back in the 'mommy wrap' position may feel vulnerable and not in control. She cannot observe what is being done on her very young child and may assume the worst. In contrast,  in  the  'knee  to  knee'  position,  the  child  is able  to  see  the  mother's  face  while  she  controls  the child's movement. This is reassuring for both child and parent. In the former position, the child only sees the dentist  and  assistant  and,  of  course,  the  overhead bright light.\nThe  dentist  did  not  start  with  initial  counseling, anticipatory  guidance,  and  preparation  of  the  mother for  realistic  expectations  for  an  eighteen-month-old child  (see  Table  5-1  for  development  milestones  of  a toddler).  Comprehending  the  importance  of  a  dental examination is usually beyond an eighteen-month-old's capacity.  A  first-time  modern  parent  may  have  false expectations.\nToddlers should ideally be scheduled early in the day, avoiding nap time. A favorite toy or blanket may accompany  the  child.  If  possible,  either  through  a  written letter or on a website, parents should be advised not to communicate any of their fears to the child. They also could be informed on the procedure that generally takes place.\nThere are various positions to facilitate the toddler's examination.  For  example,  the  dental  chair  is  raised\nTable 5-1.

Position  the  child  in  the  seated  adult  caregiver's lap (Figures 5-3 to 5-6). Interact warmly with both the child  and  the  caregiver.  The  dentist  and  parent  sit opposite  one  another  with  knees  touching.  With  the child facing the dentist, touch the child's hand. Tickle the arm. Speak gently and smile. During this 'warming up' time, brief counseling may occur. Ask the parent to turn the child 180 degrees so that the toddler is now facing them. The infant is placed on the parent's lap, facing the parent, with the child's legs wrapping around the parent's waist. While the parent is holding the patient's hands,  the  child  is  laid  back,  resting  the  head  in  the dentist's lap. This position enables the child to see and feel the parent while the dentist performs the examination  with  minimal  restraint.  The  position  allows  for excellent  visualization  of  the  oral  cavity  by  both  the parent and dentist.\nAnother option for the knee-to-knee exam is using a cushion device (Figure 5-7). A lap cushion device flexes with the baby, allowing the tilt-back to feel more secure. Some parents may prefer it over the infant lying directly on the dentist's lap. On the other hand, it might startle the child, introducing a new device which may make the exam more formal and threatening.\nWhen  approaching  the  very  young  patient  (or  any other patient, for that matter), begin with a digital examination.

Even  if  the  child  does  not comprehend the language, a soothing voice helps relax the patient. Before performing an intraoral examination, the  dentist  explains  to  the  parent  that  the  procedure does not hurt the child and that even though the young patient appears cooperative, many children begin to cry\nduring an oral examination. Most parents appreciate the forewarning. It may also be necessary to explain this to other  children  in  the  office  to  avoid  upsetting  them. Since the child is in the parent's arms, the dentist has to attempt  to  communicate  with  the  child  and  parent simultaneously. It is not unusual for a young patient's mouth to remain closed since the child does not understand what is expected. The mouth is easily opened by sliding an index finger between the teeth or gum pads and cheek, and pressing lightly against the ramus of the mandible.  However,  a  gentler  approach,  which  often achieves the same end, is to have the dental assistant rub the child's tummy. This relaxes many infants and toddlers, and their mouths often open spontaneously. Once access to the oral cavity is gained, every attempt is made to  complete  the  oral  examination  before  withdrawing from the child's mouth.\nIn summary, several points are important when examining infants and very young children:"

Both children had bleeding from the mouth and were accompanied by their parents. Sue had been at the dentist initially at  age  two  and  had  since  returned  for  a  checkup  the previous year. Jack had never been to any dentist and this emergency  visit  was  the  first  for  both  himself  and  his mother. Jack was crying and very frightened and his mom was visibly upset and tense. Conversely, Sue was a little nervous but was familiar with the office, staff, and dentist. She was looking forward to receiving the prize to be given later. Her mom remembered being told by the dentist that such  incidents  might  occur  and  are  indeed  expected. 'Kids will be kids. Maybe that is why they grow up with baby  teeth.'  On  the  other  hand,  Jack's  mom  reacted aggressively toward the dentist when she was told that her son's lip was indeed lacerated but that his teeth were not fractured due to the fall; rather they were severely decayed and only appeared broken. The mother had given Jack a baby bottle of apple juice to calm him. She was shocked  when  told  that  Jack  needed  extensive  dental work not only on his front teeth but also his molars, as they showed advance signs of ECC.\nSue was discharged after an X-ray. Jack refused to take an  X-ray  and  was  to  return  for  restorative  treatment under general anesthesia, his parent's preference.\nCase 5.3, Discussion : Obviously Jack's mother was at a disadvantage. Her first encounter with her child's dentist  was  emergent  and  under  duress.  This  could  have been avoided if she had the opportunity to establish her child's dental home earlier. The dental home should not only be analyzed on its effects on the child's oral health and anxiety but also on how it might change the dental anxiety of parents. This is not a trivial point.\nChapter  One  described  the  cycle  of  dental  fear. Maternal  anxiety  and  its  impact  on  a  child's  dental health,  anxiety,  and  behavior  has  been  extensively studied  (see  Figure  5-9).  This  anxiety  can  affect  the child's oral health and have long-term rippling effects on the child's future adult dental health (Shearer et al. 2011).  As  parents  bear  the  responsibility  for  their preschool children's oral health, anxiety may influence parental  attitudes  and  habits  regarding  the  child's oral  health  care.  Mothers  with  severe  dental  anxiety may be reluctant to  expose  their  young  child  to  the expected  'terrifying'  dental  experience.  Although there  are  clear,  common  ECC  etiological  pathways\nFigure 5-9. The dental fear cycle may be broken or avoided by establishing a dental home early. Courtesy of Dr. Ari Kupietzky.\ninvolving bacteria and diet, these can be modulated by the relative contribution of other factors, including socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds and paternal  dental  anxiety  (Seow  et  al.  2009).  Thus, research suggests that preventive strategies for children's oral health should pay closer attention not only  to  the  child's  characteristics  and  those  of  his family,  but  also  to  maternal  dental  anxiety-related behaviors (Goettems et al. 2012).\nThe dentist had alerted Sue's mother to the possibility that trauma might occur, especially during the growing period of two to four years of age, when toddlers seek independence and learn to walk. She was told what to expect and how to act in the event of a traumatic episode involving her child's teeth. Anticipatory guidance should not be limited to explanations about caries, but also include emergency situations. Other topics include: oral  development (pattern of eruption, teething facts), fluoride,  oral  hygiene  at  home,  breastfeeding's  effects on the mouth, pacifier use versus thumb-sucking effects, and nutrition and diet."

    "context_enriched_content": "non-Pharmacologic approaches in Behavior Management\nGerald Z. Wright\nAri Kupietzky\nThe previous chapters of this volume have focused on the child patient and the family. The remaining chapters deal specifically with techniques or strategies of behavior management which are used in the practice of dentistry for children.\nThe present chapter is devoted to non-  pharmacologic approaches that are commonly used by dentists today. Most of these methods have evolved from generations of  dental  practitioners.  Consequently,  some  of  the references  may  seem  historic,  but  they  are  still  valid today.  The  methods  in  this  chapter  are  extremely important  because  they  are  the  basis  for  behavior management. If a child's behavior cannot be managed, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to carry out any dental  treatment.  Behavior  management  is  therefore one of the cornerstones of pediatric dentistry (Roberts et al 2010).\nMany of the psychological terms used in this chapter are derived from learning theory. Learning theory is an all-embracing term for a body of psychological research that  describes  how  people  modify  their  behavior  patterns  as  a  result  of  personal  experience  or  the  experiences of a role model. In the language of learning theory, learning is the establishment of a connection or association between a stimulus and a response. It is often referred to as S-R theory.\nIn  the  original  edition  of  this  book,  this  chapter contained a section on learning theory. However, little has changed in this area in the past forty years and that section is omitted in the present edition. Instead, to be more relevant and practical, the chapter will interweave dentistry and psychology.\nThe  importance  of  behavior  management  and  its relationship to psychology has resulted in considerable coverage of the topic in the literature. Some are   anecdotal writings.  Some  are  based  on  psychological  principles.\nSome are controlled studies. Some survey professional practices. Together, they provide a wealth of information. To  organize  and  present  the  chapter  in  a  meaningful way,  and  include  the  pertinent  non-pharmacologic literature, it is divided into five parts: getting to know your  patient,  pre-appointment  behavior  modification, effective  communication,  non-pharmacologic  clinical strategies, and retraining."

    "context_enriched_content": "1. getting to Know your Patient\nThis  section  deals  with  getting  to  know  new  child patients.  With  all  of  these  procedures,  the  primary goals are to: (1) learn about  patient  and  parent concerns, and (2) gather information which enables a reasonably reliable estimate of the child's cooperative ability.\nKnowing as much as possible about the new patient prepares the dentist to deal with new patient situations in  a  meaningful  way.  Information  collection  begins  at the first contact. Assuming that a parent telephones the dental office for a child's appointment, the receptionist begins to create a record. The important demographic information is usually recorded on a card or computer. However,  an  astute  receptionist  will  determine  who referred  the  child  patient,  why  the  child  has  been referred  to  the  office,  and  whether  or  not  this  is  the child's  first  dental  visit.  The  responses  to  these  questions can be very enlightening.\nOnce a new patient arrives in an office, dental teams conduct inquiries in two ways: (1) using a paper and pencil questionnaire completed by a parent or   caregiver, and (2) by directly   interviewing the child and parent. In some offices, one method may   predominate, while in others, a combination of   techniques is used."

    "context_enriched_content": "Paper-and-pencil questionnaires.\nWritten questionnaires can be important tools for gaining information because probing questions can uncover critical  facts  about  a  family's  child-rearing  practices,  a child's  school  experiences,  or  a  child's  developmental status. Rather than including lengthy lists of questions that can be found in other sources, those items that have been found to be most helpful in clinical situations are shown  in  Table  6-1.  Questions  such  as  these  provide some clue or insight into a child's background.\nThe first question pertains to the intellectual capacity of the child. If 'slow learner' is checked, then it is necessary to explore the matter further with the parent. The other four questions have direct clinical relevance (Wright and Stigers 2011). The question related to the child's medical experience is from the investigation of Martin et al. (1977) and it relates to the child's history with physicians. Much has  been  written  about  the  relationship  between  past medical history and a child's cooperative behavior in the dental environment. It seems the influential feature is the quality of medical contacts. That is, if a child relates positively  to  a  physician  and  is  well-behaved,  there  is  a relatively good chance for cooperation at the dentist.\nWith respect to the response to the medical question, there is another factor worthy of consideration. To the very young child, the term 'doctor' means a physician, and  an  appointment  at  the  doctor's  office,  whether physician or dentist, is all the same. The child generalizes the past experience. When the basis for generalization  involves  a  language  label,  it  is  called  'mediated generalization.'  To  the  child  approaching  school  age, language labels form the basis for many generalizations; hence the importance of word selection.\nTable 6-1. These are clinically relevant questions that can be copied into the health history form.\nHow do you consider your child is learning?\n□ advanced in learning\n□ progressing normally\n□ a slow learner\nHow do you think your child has reacted to past medical experiences?\n□ very well\n□ moderately well\n□ moderately poorly\n□ very poorly\nHow would you rate your own anxiety\n(nervousness, fear) at this moment?\n□ high\n□ moderately high\n□ moderately low\nDoes your child think there is anything wrong with his/her teeth such as a chipped or decayed tooth, gumboil?\n□ yes\n□ no\nHow do you expect your child to react in the dental chair?\n□ very well\n□ moderately well\n□ moderately poorly\n□ very poorly\nThe next question asks parents to rate their own anxiety.  At  least  five  studies  in  the  1970s  documented  a significant relationship between mothers' anxieties and their  children's  cooperative  behaviors  in  the  dental office.  While  at  that  time  mothers  primarily  accompanied their children to the dental office, many fathers or both  parents  now  bring  children  for  dental  appointments. Since the paternal role has yet to be explored, the clinician  can  only  speculate  at  this  time  that  fathers' responses,  like  mothers'  responses,  will  be  similarly correlated.\nThe fourth question asks whether the child believes that  there  is  anything  wrong  with  their  dentition.  An affirmative response indicates that something has been identified to the child and, consequently, apprehension is likely to be greater (Wright and Alpern 1971).\nThe final question emphasizes the role of parents as legitimate  members  of  the  Pediatric  Dental  Treatment Triangle in that they can predict their children's cooperativeness with a high degree of accuracy. This question was found to be highly significant in studies by Martin et al. (1977) and Johnson and Baldwin (1968).\nAfter reviewing the questionnaire responses, it is possible that the clinician may be concerned that the child will be uncooperative. Forehand and Long (1999) have referred  to  some  uncooperative  children  as  strongwilled. They are often described as being independent, persistent, and confident. While qualities such as these are quite positive, most strong-willed children can also be  stubborn,  argumentative,  and  defiant,  leading  to non-compliance. In an effort to learn more about these children, the questionnaire in Table 6-2 was developed"

    "context_enriched_content": "The Functional Inquiry\nIn  medical  practice,  a  functional  inquiry  is  a  series of  symptom-related  questions  posed  in  a  personal interview that elicit new information and obtain further details about a presenting problem. In pediatric dentistry,  it  is  used  to  learn  about  dental  problems, explore  the  behavior  of  the  new  child  patient,  understand the parent's attitude, and assess the potential for patient  and  parent  compliance.  The  paper-and-pencil questionnaire offers a starting point. It provides general information  and  clues,  and  it  guides  the  functional inquiry. To begin, consider the first question related to learning  efficiency.  If  a  parent  has  indicated  that  the child  is  a  'slow  learner,'  more  factual  information  is necessary. A leading question might be, 'Is your child in a special class or special school?' Knowing that the child attends a special education class or school can offer a clue  about  the  functioning  level  of  the  patient.  If  the child is behind in school or in a special program, then slow learning is an important part of the patient's profile.  The  child  may  have  to  be  guided  through  dental experiences more slowly, with clear, concrete, repeated explanations and visual aids. Conversely, a parent may indicate that a child is 'advanced in learning.' The child may attend a school for the gifted. An important part of managing bright children often involves giving detailed explanations, catering to their curious natures.\nFor very young patients, two interesting questions are 'What time does your child go to bed?' and 'Is your child toilet trained?' If a child goes to bed at a regular hour, such as 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. and is toilet trained by the age of twenty-four to thirty-six months, the implication  is  that  child-rearing  practices  in  the  home  are structured. On the other hand, a three- to four-year-old child  who does not go to bed as scheduled or who is not  toilet  trained  arouses  the  experienced  clinician's suspicion  about  the  home  environment.  Is  the  parent overly  permissive?  Is  the  child's  behavior  generally non-compliant?  More  information  can  be obtained through the questionnaire in Table 6-2.\nThere is no limit to the depth of the functional inquiry, but if it is to be productive, questioning must be thoughtful. The information on the questionnaire helps to make this  efficient.  Other  avenues  to  be  explored  include rewards  and  reinforcement  in  the  home  environment. These may provide some insight into the type of behavior management techniques that would be acceptable to the parent.  Learning  in  advance  that  a  parent  does  not believe in physical punishment can prevent a future confrontation if aversive techniques are employed."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.1\nSusan, eleven years of age, came to the dental office with her father for a recall appointment. After a few minutes, Susan  was  summoned  into  the  operatory  by  the  dental hygienist and, without hesitation, the youngster followed the  hygienist. At  the  conclusion  of  the  appointment,  the dentist reported to her father that Susan's teeth were excellent and that she was a good patient. Susan's father replied, 'I'm surprised. She stayed up most of the night worrying about this visit. 'Oh,' said the dentist, 'I didn't know!'\nCase 6.1, Discussion : This case points out that functional inquiries are not limited only to new patients. When children have been patients for a long time, situations change and a periodic history review is in order. Based upon her father's remarks, the child was quite anxious. If the dentist had known about Susan's   emotional state, she might have managed her differently or spoken to her about the problem. How was the   dentist to know?\nA  recall  history  review  is  not  as  detailed  as  a  new patient inquiry. It is generally conducted with a written questionnaire that provides an update on administrative information  and  health  history.  However,  there  are other questions to be asked, as shown in Table 6-3. The first question asks about oral hygiene. If a parent notes that the home care is adequate and, on examination, the child's  oral  hygiene  appears  neglected,  something  is wrong. It  may  be  that  the  parent's  expectations  differ from those of the dentist. In this instance, consultation is necessary to re-establish hygiene goals. Or it may be that the child attends to the oral hygiene but requires further instruction.\nTable 6-3. Responses to these questions can be helpful when updating the health history. They can alert the dental team to a potential problem.\nHow do you think your child has maintained his/her oral hygiene?\n□ good\n□ fairly good\n□ not very well\n□ poor\nDoes your child have concerns about coming for this dental appointment?\n□ no anxiety\n□ a little anxiety\n□ anxious\nThe  second  question  is  a  behavioral  one.  If  a  child really  approaches  the  office  with  fear,  after  being  a patient in the office for several years, the dental team must make every effort to reduce the fearfulness over future appointments. A good way to begin is by asking 'Were you nervous coming here today?' Children are usually truthful and will confirm or deny the suspicion. 'Tell me why.' Sometimes the answer is simple: 'I don't like the taste of that (fluoride gel).' Many dentists keep several fluoride flavors in the office and can reply, 'We have several kinds here. Today, you choose one. We will find  one  that  you  like.'  The  point  is-as  in  Susan's case-important  information  may  be  missed  or  problems  undiscovered.  The  Pediatric  Treatment  Triangle variables are constantly changing and the astute clinician keeps patient information up-to-date."

    "context_enriched_content": "2. Pre-appointment Behavior Modification\nPsychologists  have  developed  many  techniques  for modifying patients' behaviors by using the principles of learning theory. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, may be defined as the attempt to  alter  human  behavior  and  emotion  in  a  beneficial manner  and  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  learning theory (Eysenck 1964). These laws state that rewarded behavior  tends  to  occur  more  often  in  presence,  and unrewarded  or  punished  behavior  tends  to  be  extinguished or disappear.  Behavior  therapists  use  various conditioning techniques to effect behavior changes. In this  section,  pre-appointment  behavior  modification refers  to  anything  that  is  said  or  done  to  positively influence a child's behavior before entering the dental operatory. In recent years, some of the methods employed include pre-appointment mailings, audiovisual modeling, and patient modeling.\nWhy  use  pre-appointment  behavior  modification? Dental anxiety represents a general state in which the individual is apprehensive and is prepared for something negative to happen (Klingberg 2008). It persists in our society. In a recent survey of 583 children nine to twelve years old, only 64% reported liking their last dental visit, while 11% didn't like their visit and 12% were afraid to go to the dentist (AlSarheed 2011). With data like this, it is  apparent  that  dental  anxiety  remains  a  common problem. It appears to develop mostly in childhood and adolescence (Locker et al. 2001). Consider the following scenario and what can be done to prevent it."

    "context_enriched_content": "Pre-appointment contact\nMany  parent  and  child  concerns  can  be  alleviated. Pre-appointment  contact  can  provide  directions  for preparing the child patient for an initial dental visit and, therefore,  increase  the  likelihood  of  a  successful  first appointment. It also can diminish a parent's apprehension. The sequence of events in many dental offices is: (1) the parent phones to make an appointment, (2) the appointment is made for some time in the future, and (3) the parent is contacted as a reminder the day before the  dental  appointment.  Years  ago,  Tuma  (1954)  suggested  sending  a  pre-appointment  letter  explaining what  is  to  be  done  at  the  first  visit.  He  hinted  that this  could  modify  the  behavior  of  some  children.  In addition  to  serving  as  an  appointment  reminder,  it established  good  public  relations.  He  explained  that child  management  in  dentistry  was  based  on  sound principles  of  psychology,  and  he  suggested  rewards for  good  behavior  or  as  tokens  of  affection-not  as bribery. He implied that rewards for negative behavior only  reinforced  it  and  established  bad  habits.  Thus, Tuma explained basic pediatric dentistry management techniques in psychological terms to parents.\nYour Child's First Dental Visit\nDear (Name),\nI am writing to you because I am pleased with the interest you are showing in your child's dental health by making an appointment for a dental examination. Children who have their first dental visit when they are very young are likely to have a favorable outlook toward dental care throughout life.\nAt the first appointment we will examine your child's teeth and gums, and take any necessary x-rays. For most children, this proves to be an interesting and even happy occasion. All of the people on our staff enjoy children and know how to work with them.\nYou parents play a most important role in getting children started with a good attitude toward dental care, and your cooperation is most appreciated. One of the useful things that you can do is to be completely natural and easy-going when you tell your child about the dental appointment. This approach will enable your child to view the appointment primarily as an opportunity to meet some new people interested in maintaining good oral health.\nGood general health depends in large part upon the development of good habits, such as sensible eating and sleeping routines, exercise, recreation, and the like. Dental health also depends on good habits, including proper tooth brushing, regular dental visits and avoidance of excessive sweets. We will have a chance to discuss these points further during your child's appointment.\nBest wishes, and I look forward to meeting you.\nSincerely,\n(Name)\n(Wright, G.Z., Alpern, G.D. and Leake, J.L.

(1973) conducted a randomized, controlled study that  demonstrated  the  beneficial  effect  of  the  preappointment letter. They mailed these letters to mothers of children three to six years of age who had appointments  for  first  dental  visits.  The  behavior  of  these children was compared with that of another group who had  not  received  letters.  As  a  result  of  the  contact, children were better prepared by their mothers for their dental  visits  and  were  more  cooperative.  This  was especially true for children three to four years old.\nthe site. Many patients provide their e-mail addresses to the dental office, and letters can be sent directly to them. Other technology software programs such as TeleVox® (®TeleVox Software Inc.) enable practices to send pre-appointment reminders and instructions to ensure parents  remember  and  are  well-prepared  for  appointments with their dentist. These programs can leave the information in various languages.\nA simple letter can do much to relax a mother and help her prepare her child for the dental visit. In the study of Wright et al. (1973), mothers acknowledged their appreciation  of the dentist's  thoughtfulness. They  welcomed  the  concern  for  their  children.  The demonstrated effect is of great importance to the clinician. It reduced maternal anxiety and favorably affected the patient's dental office behavior. Box 6.1 is a sample of the letter.\nNowadays, parental anxiety still needs to be considered,  and  new  technology  offers  different  options  for pre-appointment contact. Many pediatric dentists have web sites, and a pre-appointment letter can be put on"

    "context_enriched_content": "Audiovisual modeling\nThis strategy can be applied before the appointment and in  the  clinic.  The  social  learning  theory  proposed  by Bandura (1977) has become perhaps the most influential theory  of  learning  and  development.  While  rooted  in many of the basic concepts of learning theory, Bandura believed that direct reinforcement could not account for all types of learning. His theory added a social element, arguing  that  people  could  learn  new  information  and behaviors  by  watching  others.  Factors  involving  both the model and the child patient can play a role in the success of observational learning (modeling). The child has  to  pay  attention,  remember  what  was  observed, reproduce the behavior, and have good reason (motivation)  to  want  to  adopt  the  behavior.  Without  these factors, observational learning becomes ineffective.\nSince  the  child  must  pay  attention,  anything  that detracts attention will have a negative effect on observational learning. If modeling by audiovisual means in the dental office, a staff member should be present to direct the child's attention to the model.\nThe ability to store information is also an important part of the learning process. Retention can be affected by a number of factors, so it is helpful if the staff member points out key parts of the presentation. The staff may question  the  child  to  reinforce  the  learning.  Later,  it  is vital  for  the  child  to  recall  information  and  act  on  the observational learning. Once the child has paid attention to the model and retained the information, he should be led to the operatory with the parent. The procedure in the operatory should follow the model as closely as   possible so that the child can actually reproduce the behavior.\nFinally, for observational learning to be successful, the child  has  to  be  motivated  to  imitate  the  behavior  that was modeled. Reinforcement plays an important role in motivation.  For  example,  if  a  child  sees  a  departing patient  praised  for  their  good  behavior  and  given  a prize, that motivates the new patient.\nDuring the 1970s there were at least eight investigations into the merit of using videotaped modeling. Most of these studies used different procedures. For example, some had an assistant working with a child, while others left the child alone. The videotape presentations   differed.\nFigure  6-1. The  graph  shows  mean  behavioral  differences.  The  higher behavior profile rating indicates less cooperation. Note the wide difference in behavioral profile ratings between the two groups. Adapted from Melamed, B.G. et al. J Dent Res 1975: 54, 797.\nAs a consequence, results from these studies were mixed. A  most  supportive  study  was  that  of  Malemed  et  al. (1975). They divided children between five and eleven years  of  age  into  two  groups.  One  group  viewed  an unrelated film and the other watched a modeling film. Their  results,  which  are  summarized  graphically  in Figure 6-1, demonstrate the benefit of modeling.\nGreenbaum and Melamed (1988) contend that research on modeling indicates that this technique offers dentists a  means  of  reducing  fear  in  child  patients  of  all  ages. They recommend it for children who have had no prior exposure to dental treatment. They further suggest that with  videotape  technology,  the  practitioner  has  the means  to  incorporate  patient  viewing  of  pre-recorded modeling tapes as part of the usual waiting period. Such a procedure creates a prepared patient, and the dentist will spend less time in behavioral management tasks.\nAudiovisual modeling has several advantages. Since it  is  a  'canned'  presentation,  nothing  inadvertently creeps  into  the  presentation  that  could  influence  the child negatively. However, an audiovisual presentation has two obvious disadvantages: (1) there is expense, as it requires special equipment and space, and (2) unless the presentation is developed by the dentist, it can be impersonal. For these reasons, some practitioners prefer live models."

    "context_enriched_content": "Live models\nThere are three types of live models in a general practice:  siblings,  other  children,  and  parents.  Research  by Ghose  et  al.  (1969)  evaluated  the  benefit  of  sibling models. The study concentrated on the effect of siblings on  three-  to  five-year-old  children  without  previous dental experiences. Sibling pairs entered the clinical area together, and the older child was examined first. Next, the younger child was examined while the older child observed. Similarly,  dental  prophylaxes  and  radiographs  were  performed  for  the  children.  At  a  second visit, a local anesthetic was administered and a restoration  was completed. Sibling pairs serving as a control group were examined and treated separately. The study concluded that the presence of the older sibling had a favorable effect on the behavior of younger child at the first visit (Figure 6-2). The presence of a big brother or sister  also  seemed  to  maintain  or  even  improve  the younger  child's  behavior  during  subsequent  visits. Recall appointments in particular provide an excellent modeling  opportunity  for  children  (similar  to  parent recall appointments).\nUsing non-related children as models is also beneficial.  Investigating  this  strategy,  White  and  colleagues (1974)  employed  an  eight-year-old  model  for  children four  to  eight  years  of  age.  They  divided  subjects  into three groups and compared the beneficial effects from either a modeling or a desensitization approach, with a control  group  having  no  preparation.  They  observed less avoidance behavior with both experimental groups and found that those children with the model seldom asked for a parent to be present. Similar results in the clinical setting were described by Adelson and Godfried (1970).  They  emphasized  that  the  model  was  given  a high  status  and  rewarded  for  good  behavior  in  the presence of the observing child.\nFigure  6-2. The  older  sibling  models  for  the  younger  one.  Both  children learn when an explanation is provided by the dentist.\nThe merits of modeling procedures using audiovisual or  live  models  are  recognized  generally  by  psychologists. The merits are as follows: (1) stimulation of new and positive behaviors, (2) facilitation of behavior in a more appropriate time, (3) decrease of fear-related, inappropriate  behavior,  and  (4)  extinction  of  fears.  These procedures offer the clinician some interesting ways to modify  children's  behaviors  before  they  are  seated  in the  dental  chair.  Unfortunately,  in  the  years  since  the 1970s, there has been little behavioral science research on this subject. Hopefully this area will be visited again in the near future."

Dr.  A.  was  in  a  hurry  'to  get  to  the  mouth.' Welbury et al. (2005) refer to this type of communication as a preliminary chat. They suggest initiating conversation with non-dental topics. Many young children are very proud of their new clothing and they like to  be  asked  about  it.  Older  children  often  wear  team sweaters, school crests or group uniforms (e.g., Brownies, Cubs,  Beavers),  and  they  like  to  be  questioned  about their activities. Whatever  the  ploy for initiating a conversation, questions should be phrased so that a child cannot offer a simple 'yes' or 'no' reply. Next, ask an open-ended  question  such  as  'What  are  those  badges for?' This tends to establish communication. The process\nof  drawing  a  child  out  and  into  communication  with others around them is referred to as externalization. If other children in the family have attended the office previously,  there  should  be  information  such  as  siblings' names, pets, schools, or hobbies to call upon. This makes the initial questioning much more personal.\nChildren are often shy and reluctant to talk when they are first exposed to a new experience and to new people. When they have gained confidence and are comfortable in the unfamiliar environment, they will usually speak more freely. During the first dental visit they may speak more  readily  to  a  dental  assistant.  This  enables  the dentist to listen and make an evaluation of the comprehension and emotional maturity of the child."

The child moves her legs, causing her entire body to shift slightly, and Dr. B. says in a calm voice, 'Jenny, you must sit still. This will only take a minute. Do you understand?' Jenny nods her head affirmatively,  but  again  changes  her  leg  position, causing her head to move. So Dr. B. repeats the instructions  in  a  firm  voice.  Jenny  does  not  move  for  about twenty seconds, during which time half of the preparation is complete. She then moves again. This time Dr. B. repeats instructions in a firm,   displeased tone. 'Jenny, sit still. Don't move.' The cavity preparation was completed without further difficulty and the child is complimented for her behavior.\nCase 6.4, Discussion : Two aspects of this case are noteworthy. First, the patient was four years old and the message  may  not  have  been  understood.  Dentists sometimes fail to communicate effectively (Chambers 1976). That may have been the problem in this case. If we say to a child 'Open your mouth' or 'Climb up into  the  chair,'  the  child  likely  will  understand  the instruction. But when the dentist said, 'Sit perfectly still.  This  will  only  take  a  minute.'  Dr.  B.  probably thought that the instructions to Jenny were clear and that good communication was established. That assumption  may  be  incorrect.  It  is  possible  that  the child did not truly understand what was meant by 'sit still,'  and  it  is  probable  that  she  had  no  concept  of what constitutes a minute because she began moving after  twenty    seconds.  Second,  when  the  instructions were given on the first two occasions, they were delivered in a calm voice. On the third occasion, a firm displeased tone seemed to gain the result and the child was still. This is known as voice control.\nThere  are  other  ways  to  deal  with  this  situation. Dr. B. could have been more explicit and explained the problem to the child. 'Jenny, the tooth that I am going to fix is way back here,' he could have said, pointing to  the  tooth.  'I  need  you  to  help  me.  This  is  very important. If your head moves, even a little, then your tooth moves too. If you move your legs, it moves your head and your head moves the tooth. Try not to move your head, your arms or your legs while I am working on the tooth. I am going to count out loud and when I  finish  counting,  we  will  be  done.'  By  stressing  the importance, the child's awareness of the situation may be enhanced. By asking her to help, she is a member of the team.\nClarity only occurs when the message is understood in the same way by the sender and the receiver. There has to be a 'fit' between the intended and understood messages. For children with limited vocabularies, more detailed  verbal  communication  is  often  needed,  and sometimes  it  has  to  be  supplemented  in  other  ways. Consider  a  common  experience  in  the  home  environment. A  three-year-old  approaches  the  hot  stove.  Her mother says, 'Go away, its hot.' If the child does not understand  the  meaning  of  hot,  the  she  may  return again.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  mother  clarifies  the verbal command and supplements it by picking up the child, placing the hand near the hot plate, and explaining that 'hot hurts,' the message becomes clearer. An analogy in pediatric dentistry is the three-year-old who lifts a hand to the mouth while the dentist is using an explorer.  Saying  'put  your  hands  down'  gives  a command, but the child may not pay much attention to it. In effect, it scolds the child. Demonstrating the sharpness of the instrument and telling the child to keep his hands down in order not to get hurt is more effective communication.\nTo  improve  message  clarity  with  young  children, pediatric dentists and their office personnel have to use euphemisms sometimes. These are non-offensive word substitutes. For most pediatric dentists, euphemisms are like a second language. The following is a small glossary"

    "context_enriched_content": "Multisensory communication\nThe spoken word is not the only means of communication.  Nonverbal  communication,  such  as  stroking  the hand  of  a  young  child,  communicates  the  feeling  of warmth.  A  dental  assistant's  smile  conveys  approval and  acceptance.  Similarly,  these  feelings  can  be  transmitted  through  the  eyes.  Since  communication  is  a reciprocal process, children who avoid eye contact are telling the dentist that they are not yet ready to cooperate fully. Hence, effective  communication  occurs through a multisensory approach.\nWhenever  communication  occurs  there  is  a  transmitter, a medium, and a receiver. The dentist or dental health  team  is  the  transmitter,  the  office  environment provides an array of media, and the child is the receiver. It  is  widely  recognized  that  certain  characteristics  are typical  of  all  three  for  good  behavior  management (Moss 1972).\nThe transmitter may be one or all of the members of the  dental  health  team  during  a  child's  dental  visit. However,  one  fundamental  rule  must  be  recognized. Verbal transmission may come from only one direction at any given time . Children cannot divide their attention between  two  adults  simultaneously  or  be  distracted (Figure 6-3). If the dentist has entered into a discussion with the child, then the assistant must refrain from commenting. Typically, the error of two adults speaking to the child at one time occurs under stress. If a child resists an  injection,  the  dentist  may  be  trying  to  control  her, and  often  a  well-meaning  dental  assistant  chimes  in with  words  for  the  child.  The  communication  then comes  from  two  directions  and  the  message  becomes unclear.\nThe  attitude  of  the  transmitter  is  often  conveyed through the voice. Voice intonation, tone, and\nFigure 6-3. The dentist explains the procedure to the child patient. Note that the child has ear phones in place. Effective communication can only come from  one  source  at  a  time.  Avoid  ear  phones  and  other  distractors  when communicating.\nmodulation can express empathy and firmness. Often it is not what is said but rather how it is said that creates an impact. Young children do not always hear or understand  words  and  sentences,  thus  repetition  is  almost always required. The transmission must be constant. A kind pattern can give a young child a feeling of security and promote behavior management.\nSince communication is multisensory, posture, movements,  and  position  of  the  dental  health  team  are extremely  important  nonverbal  communication  signs. Generally,  movements  should  be  slow  and  smooth, designed  to  convey  a  positive  attitude  and  instill  a feeling  of  security  in  the  patient.  Rough  or  gentle application  of  instruments  also  conveys  an  operator's attitude.  When  speaking  to  a  child,  approximate  the child's  level  in  the  dental  chair  rather  than  tower above him.\nThe medium in the dentist-patient communication system  is  complex.  While  it  obviously  involves  the projections  of  the  office    personnel,  it  also  encompasses  the  dental  office  environment.  Office  design, pictorial  displays,  and  background  music  all  are media of communication. They convey messages, and should therefore be considered. When we deal with the school-age group, the latest music group may be preferable. Quiet background music, however, would be more likely to promote a settling effect for the very young child. The importance of the dental office environment  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  Chapter Sixteen.\nThe visual channel must always be considered in multisensory communication. Sometimes those things which may seem natural to the dentist may be unsettling to a patient. A case in point is cited by one of the authors:"

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.5\nOne week, two children were referred to Dr. C. as behavior problems.  After  chatting  with  both  of  these  children, Dr.  C.  did  not  understand  why  they  were  considered behavior problems. Trying to comprehend the reasons for their  misbehaviors,  Dr.  C.  asked  them  what  frightened them during their previous dental experiences. Both children (from the same office) referred to the 'ugly' posters in the dentist's office. When checking with the dentist, Dr. C. learned that the office had new charts on the operatory walls,  which  were  produced  by  a  commercial company to demonstrate the progress of periodontal disease.  It  was  a  family  practice,  but  the  office  medium catered to adults.\nCase 6.5, Discussion : A friendly atmosphere sets the mood when a child patient and parent enter the reception room (see Chapter Sixteen). The welcoming smile of the   receptionist, the décor of the room, and a homey atmosphere can all play an important role in establishing communication. The dentist treating children in general practice has to seriously consider how children react to the office environment.\nChildren in their roles as receivers also have characteristics that need to be recognized by the dental team for effective behavior management. Their focus of attention is narrow and indivisible. The messages being communicated must be continuous to hold their attention. If the dentist  has  to  leave  the  operatory,  someone  else  must transmit; otherwise the receiver builds up concerns. This oversight commonly occurs when the dentist leaves the operatory and the dental assistant focuses on chores (such as  cleaning  instruments)  without  communicating  with the child. Left alone, fear can develop in these children.\nOther senses of the receiver can be used to advantage. In school, children are encouraged to touch. Let them touch the  rubber  dam,  prophylaxis  cup,  cotton  roll  and  other non-harmful objects. Children should also be allowed to use their sense of smell and be made to feel comfortable. The positioning of the patient in the chair is important, and so is the positioning of light. Light shining in a child's eyes can upset her potential as the receiver. Most children are good receivers. The message to be communicated is that the child can relax and need not be afraid.\nPrevious research has shown that the ability to assess non-verbal communication in children is closely related to the ability to observe. Using videotapes, Brockhouse and Pinkham (1980) studied the observational abilities of 141 participants and found that significant patterns evolved. One pattern was that pediatric dentists were more   accurate in their abilities to predict behavior as compared to other experience levels. Dental assistants were   significantly less accurate than others, including student groups. This finding was somewhat surprising, as many dental assistants had spent more chair time with children in the clinic than any other group. Another pattern revealed that freshman students had poorer predictive abilities than other dentist or student groups. They lacked clinical or didactic experience. The investigators concluded that experience appears to  be  the  best  means  of  developing  the  ability  to  assess non-verbal communication in children, but formal education is also important, perhaps because of the complexity of the communication process."

When  Tyler  frets  again,  the instructor stops, explains the noise, solicits the child's cooperation, and completes the procedure without incident.\nCase 6.6, Discussion : To support the point that confidence is  an  important  ingredient  in  communicating  with  the pediatric patient, a study of communication patterns was reported by Wurster et al. (1979). They examined communication patterns among sixteen randomly selected senior dental students and their child dental patients. Interactions  were  videotaped  during  regular  treatment appointments. The data showed that the probability of a child's behavior following a practitioner's behavior was related. Patterns of behavior employed by clinicians will lead to a certain type of behavior on the part of the child. If the communication pattern is appropriate, the desired behavior likely will be achieved. In this same study, the operator's  confidence  level  was  considered,  and  the results showed that less confident operators were responsible  for  95%  of  coercive  behavior,  86%  of  permissive behavior and 87% of uncooperative behavior."

The child, who has a small mouth, whimpers and fidgets in the dental chair. Dr. F . is afraid of dropping the band in Harry's  mouth  and  says,  'You  must  sit  still  and  stop crying!'\nCase 6.8, Discussion :  Most people (including children) do not like to be told what to do, and this approach often increases  their  resistance.  These  are  'you'  messages such as 'You are too old to behave like that!' or 'You know  better  than  that!'  These  are  negative  messages that undermine the rapport that a child could develop with the dentist.\nAn  alternative  is  to  send  'I'  messages.  Effectively communicated, 'I' messages establish the focus of the problem where it belongs. They are not negative evaluations of the child, but they identify a problem and establish ownership of it. For example, 'I can't fix your teeth if your mouth is not open wide' and 'It will take me a lot longer to fix your teeth if you don't open your mouth wide!' The 'I' statements are more than just a change in phrasing from 'you' statements, which carry an evaluative statement about the child-the 'I' statements disclose how the dentist is feeling. They describe a situation that needs to be altered if the dentist is to be able to solve the problem.\nWepman and  Sonnenberg  (1979)  discussed  a  set  of techniques that seemed well-suited to increase the flow of  information  between  the  dentist  and  child  patient. Owning the problem and active listening are the first two steps. Both encourage genuine communication. The patient is stimulated to express feelings, and the dentist does the same-a necessary process in communication. If the child behaves in a way that causes an emotion in the dentist, the dentist can and should express, within reason,  not  only  the  quality  of  emotion,  but  also  its strength. Consider the following straightforward approach  with  a  whining  child:  'Please  don't  cry.  It makes me feel bad. I don't like to feel bad. I like to feel good! You like to feel good too. So, why are you crying?' This brings the problem right to the surface and the dentist is prepared to listen."

They contend that it is not a matter of choosing among techniques\nFigure 6-4. This behavioral management plan or flow chart illustrates that the treatment of a child is complex. It involves knowledge of child development, family environments, and behavior management combined with a variety of potential strategies.\nbut a matter of incorporating the best techniques into a plan. A flow chart or plan for behavior management is shown in Figure 6-4. The flow chart begins with learning about child development, children's behavior and family  environments.  These  are  the  topics  of  earlier chapters in this book. Gaining knowledge about families and children is important to behavior management. It is comparable to dentists learning dental material science before performing operative dentistry.\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter, is an important part of the behavioral plan.\nGetting to know your patient is the next stage of the continuum. This was discussed earlier in this chapter. Probing for information and responses from parenting can direct the future management technique.\nA review of the literature reveals that there are many sources of uncooperative behavior. Most of these behaviors,  however,  can  be  attributed  to  manifestations  of anxiety.  Thus  pre-appointment  behavior  modification,\nThe plan escalates in intensity as the dentist (or dental hygienist)-child  patient  interaction  occurs  during  the first  visit.  Usually,  this  involves  the  oral  examination and  taking  any  necessary  radiographs  and  perhaps includes a dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene instructions. At  this  time,  if  the  child  requires  treatment,  the dentist  has  to  determine  what  management technique will be recommended. Discussion with a parent ensues and the examination findings, course of treatment, and management strategies are discussed.\nThe  American  Academy  of Pediatric Dentistry (2011) lists numerous management techniques in their guidelines.  Some  of  these  are  more  acceptable  to parents  than  others.  In  an  attempt  to  explore  their acceptability, a group of studies have been conducted\nTable 6-4.

(2005)  concluded  that  the mean parental ratings were in the acceptable range for all techniques in the study, except for hand-over-mouth. Interestingly,  there  were  large  standards  of  deviation associated with the techniques, indicating considerable variability in parents' attitudes. Comparison of the three studies shown in Table 6-4 reveals that parental attitudes changed  over  the  two  decades.  While  tell-show-do  is rated consistently as the most acceptable technique in all studies, the rankings show that general anesthesia has increased  in  acceptability  over  the  past  two  decades. Passive restraint (Papoose Board) has been in the lower range  of  acceptability  in  all  studies,  and  hand-overmouth  acceptability  has  progressively  decreased  over the  years,  making  it  the  least  acceptable  in  the  latest survey.\nData from these studies helps the clinician to select management techniques, but this data has limitations. Parental attitudes change over time. Thus, it is important  to  keep  abreast  of  new  surveys  and  studies.  The children's  past  dental  experiences,  which  could  have influenced the findings, were not explored. The authors noted that it would have been desirable to include more parents and patients from private practices. Social and cultural  variables  could  influence  parental  attitudes. Nonetheless,  before  making  any  management  recommendation, dentists should be aware of the acceptability of techniques regionally.\nNon-pharmacologic techniques may be classified  in different ways. There are those that are non-threatening, which  Roberts  et  al.  (2010)  refer  to  as  universally accepted  techniques.  Another  group  of  techniquesthose that are used with uncooperative children-limit the  movements  of  child  patients.  They  have  been referred to as controversial techniques, and they are not universally  accepted.  Another  way  of  classifying  the two groups of techniques is to refer to them as 'noninvasive' or 'invasive.'\nThe remainder of this chapter will describe non-pharmacological techniques that are used in pediatric dentistry. Those that are non-invasive include: tell-show-do, behavior shaping, reinforcement, operant conditioning, modeling, voice control, desensitization, visual imagery, humor,  distraction  and  contingency  distraction,  and parent  presence/absence.  The  invasive  techniques  are hand-over-mouth (HOM) and physical restraint."

    "context_enriched_content": "Tell-show-do (TSD)\nThis technique was formalized and developed into a training  technique  by  Addelston  (1959).  Specifically, the TSD procedure is as follows. The dentist explains to the child what is going to be done in language that the  child  can  understand.  This  is  done  as  slowly and  with  as  much  repetition  as  necessary  until  the child is aware of what the procedure will be. Lengthy, complicated  procedures  are  broken  down  into  steps for easier communication. Armed with the knowledge of language development at various ages, the dentist and all office personnel can use the 'tell' portion of the technique  advantageously  by  phrasing  instructions with  words  that  are  at  the  child's  language  level. Second, the dentist shows the child what will be used, and  how  it  works  (e.g.,  hi-speed  drill)  and  how  the procedure  will  be  carried  out,  demonstrating  on  an inanimate  object  to  be  sure  that  understanding  is complete. Third, without deviating from the explanation or demonstration, the practitioner proceeds directly to perform the previewed operation.\nWhen demonstrating to the child, all team members must be fully aware of their transmitting roles. Sudden movements or unexpected noises should be avoided, as these changes can disrupt rapport. An X-ray machine, for example, is large and potentially frightening. After talking about it and demonstrating its use on yourself or an assistant (with the current off), introduce the machine by bringing the X-ray head slowly to the child. Noisy instruments  should  be  demonstrated  to  children  at  a distance  to  avoid  startling  them.  Gradually  bring  the instrument  closer  for  demonstration  and  inspection. Operating a hand-piece without touching the child, or letting the patient feel the vibration without cutting the\ntooth, allows the child to extinguish any learned association between noise and vibration and pain and undesirable behavior. This is a desensitizing technique or,  as  it  is  sometimes  called,  'approach  by  successive approximations.'\nThe TSD method can be used on a young child who lacks  dental  preconditioning  at  a  first  visit.  It  can  be used for a child who is fearful because of a prior painful experience  in  another  dental  office,  or  for  one  who  is apprehensive because of information received from parents or peers. The method permits the child to learn a stimulus-response  association.  It  allows  the  dentist  to complete procedures properly and provides a satisfying experience for both individuals. The child visiting the dentist for the first time learns by successive approximations. The dentist or dental team member leads the child step by step.\nNothing  evokes  fear  or  anxiety  more  than  the unknown. In the TSD technique, attempts are made to remove the  unknown.  However,  one  simple  piece  of armamentarium  is  important  to  the  technique  and often overlooked: a mirror (Figure 6-5). If a mirror is not  used,  how  can  a  child  see  a  rubber  dam  on  the tooth? Although  the  mirror  may  sometimes  interfere with the working area, it is a small inconvenience when the end result is considered.\nThe TSD technique works because it avoids the fear of the unknown, but another factor that really makes it effective is consistency in not hurting the child. Over the  years,  the  TSD  technique  has  not  been  used  as  a preface to local anesthesia. Some clinicians are of the opinion that showing the child the needle and syringe, more often than not, leads to a breakdown in dentistpatient  rapport.  Because  the  administration  of  local anesthesia plays a significant role in a daily pediatric dentistry  practice,  two  conflicting  views  should  be considered."

The topical anesthetic is  applied to the injection site for at least one minute before  needle  insertion.  In  addition,  the  child  can  be distracted.  Many  dentists  cease  conversation  at  this time.  This  is  an  oversight  that  is  likely  due  to  stress. Conversation  can  be  a  distractor.  Some  are  of  the opinion that the sight of the needle can be frightening and suggest that the child need not see the syringe if it is carried properly to the mouth.\nOn the other hand, Addelston (1959) used TSD during local  anesthesia  administration  with  great  success.  He advocated letting the child observe the injection with a mirror.

    "context_enriched_content": "Behavior shaping\nBy definition, behavior shaping is that procedure which very slowly develops behavior by reinforcing successive approximations of the desired conduct until it comes to be. Thus, this technique is a simple method of teaching the  child  step-by-step  what  is  expected  in  the  dental operatory. At the same time, it is a procedure which obviates apprehension. Behavior shaping can be looked upon as a form of behavior modification because it is used to alter  conduct  according  to  established  principles.  The method is used with children who demonstrate sufficient\ncooperation to establish communication. With those who demonstrate  negative  behavior,  a  reasonable  level  of cooperation must first be established.\nFor both Behavior Shaping and TSD, an office's dental team members should follow an established office protocol for introducing new procedures or instruments to children. That protocol might be:\n1. State the goal at the outset. 'Today we are going to check your teeth.'\n2. Divide  the  explanations.  'First,  we  have  to  count your  teeth.  We  will  count  the  upstairs  teeth  first. Now, we need to count your downstairs teeth. Next, we  have  to  feel  your  teeth  to  make  sure  they  are strong.  Let  me  show  you  my  tooth  feeler.  This  is how I use it (placing explorer on finger nail).'\n3. Use age appropriate language. For young children, use euphemisms.\nBehavior shaping is a learning model. It is well-recognized  that  programs  which  most  closely  follow  the learning theory model will be the most efficient. Those which deviate from the model will be less efficient, with the loss of efficiency directly related to the amount of deviation  from  the  model.  Thus,  by  developing  an understanding of psychological principles and by modifying familiar techniques  to better fit the  model, improved results in the practice of behavior management can be obtained.\nAlthough  TSD  and  Behavior  Shaping  are  similar, there are some subtle differences. They are:\n1. Behavior shaping requires positive behavior throughout the procedure. TSD makes no mention of the reactive behavior.\n2. Behavior shaping allows retracing of steps. If you have completed telling the child about the procedure and the child looks away when showing an instrument, the clinician has to return to the telling stage. To get the child's attention, it may be necessary at this point to speak firmly to the child.\n3. Behavior  shaping  includes  positive  reinforcement throughout. TSD makes no mention of reinforcement."

    "context_enriched_content": "Positive Reinforcement\nAn integral part of behavior shaping is reinforcement. In the process of establishing desirable patient behavior, it is essential to give appropriate feedback (AAPD guidelines 2011).  Positive  reinforcement  is  an  effective  technique  to reward desired behaviors and strengthen their recurrence.\nReinforcement  is  an  important  concept  of  learning theory.  If  a  response  results  in  obtaining  a  goal,  this response is rewarded or reinforced. A stimulus such as a painful  tooth  is  the  motivation  for  a  child  to  visit  the dental office. The visit is the response. The elimination of pain is the goal. A pleasant appointment resulting in oral comfort satisfactorily attains the goal, and therefore rewards or reinforces the child's behavior. Similarly, if a child is afraid of injections, and the dentist convinces the child  that  there  will  be  no  pain,  delivering  a  painless injection  reinforces  the  positive  cooperative  behavior that has been attained.\nThere  are  different  types  of  reinforcements.  Consider a  child  who  is  receiving  instructions.  During  this  conversation and any subsequent explanations or demonstrations, when there is a positive response to a suggestion the child is reinforced by a smile and a variety of sounds of approbation (verbal social reinforcers)-'right' or 'great' or 'that's good.' Most reinforcements of everyday life are social in nature. A smile reinforces behavior because the person who is smiling is more likely to supply subsequent reinforcements than one who is not (Ferster 1964). Even a small child has learned this fact. Consider this scenario in which the child is having a tooth restored."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.9\nDr. A.: 'We are almost finished with the job. You are being a good helper!'\nA little while lAter:\nDr. A.: 'Can you open your mouth a little wider? Oh, you are a good helper!'\nA little while lAter:\n- Dr. A.: 'Jimmy, can you open your mouth a little more? What a good helper!'\nCase 6.9, Discussion :  Three times the dentist congratulated  Jimmy  by  telling  him  that  he  is  a  good  helper. There is nothing wrong saying that, but it is not an effective reinforcement. 'You are a good helper!' is a general statement. For the compliment to be truly effective, the reinforcement  has  to  be  specific.  When  children  are rewarded specifically, such as 'you are really helping me by opening your mouth wide,' the reinforcing statement unsurprisingly causes the child to open wider.\nClinical  research  in  psychology  has  confirmed  that immediate reinforcement is more effective than delayed rewards  in  enforcing  behavior  shaping  and  modification.  Skinner  (1953)  demonstrated  the  existence  of  a temporal  gradient. Accordingly,  reactions  followed  by immediate reinforcement are better learned than those more removed from the reinforcement. The more immediately reinforcement follows the response, the stronger the association between the cue (good behavior) and the\nresponse (verbal approval). The desired behavior will be learned more readily.\nThe value of immediate social rewards cannot be overstated. Complimenting a child immediately on any aspect of their behavior which we would like to reinforce should be an integral part of the conversation in the dental office. Praise  should  concern  the  child's  efforts  and  achievements, not his personality attributes. This is  what immediate  social  rewards  should  sound  like:  'Wow, you're really helping today. I didn't know you could open this wide,' or 'You are the best patient we've had all day.' These comments should come not only from the dentist but from all the members of the staff. The reinforcements, of course, are used only for acceptable behavior.\nAny excuse can be used for a compliment. If a child is whimpering  or  fidgeting,  try  to  ignore  it.  Consider  it minor  inappropriate  misbehavior.  When  the  patient stops for a while, that is the point to reward the correct response.  'Now  you're  doing  great.  You  are  sitting really still. I hope you can keep it up.' If the inappropriate response occurs and is not reinforced, the strength of the response progressively decreases and it is eventually eliminated. Consider the following strategy for fiveyear-old Ralph, who  is scheduled  for a  one-hour restorative  appointment.  After  fifteen  minutes,  this conversation occurred.\nCase  6.10,  Discussion :  Ralph  continued  to  ask  similar questions, slowing the progress of the appointment and irritating the dental team. Note that the dentist did not give  Ralph  an  exact  estimate  of  the  time.  Saying  forty-five minutes would likely mean  little to him. However,  this  was  not  the  problem.  By  replying  to Ralph's questions, the dentist gave the child attention, thereby reinforcing the undesirable attention. A better approach  might  have  been  not  to  reply  to  the  first question and in reply to the second question, simply say 'This will take quite a bit longer. When you ask me that, I have to stop working, and it makes it slower. So, I can't stop  to  answer  your  questions  anymore.'  When  a response occurs but is not reinforced, it can eventually be eliminated. This is an example of response extinction. However, when inappropriate behavior-such as raising  the  hand,  clutching  at  the  operator's  arm,  or moving the head from the headrest-interferes with the treatment,  social  aversive  conditioning  by  means  of voice control will suppress the response. This is especially effective if an alternative response is available for obtaining positive reinforcement. One could say, 'No, don't do that,' in a loud, firm tone. Then, in a warm, friendly tone, say, 'That is better, good.' Children will work for rewards and try to be deserving of them."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.9\nOvert  demonstrations  of  affection,  such  as  holding and  kissing  the  small,  young  child,  are  also  a  type  of immediate social reinforcement useful in maintaining a behavior pattern. However, if the dentist is not customarily  overtly  affectionate  or  demonstrative  it  may  be awkward,  and  both  the  dentist  and  the  child  may  be uncomfortable.  It  is  better  to  be  natural.  Touching  a young child or holding his hand is fine, or an affectionate arm around the shoulder may suffice. These demonstrations of affection, however, have their limitations. Children over nine or ten years of age have reached a more  independent  stage  and  can  be  very  aloof.  They may feel  uncomfortable  in  this  kind  of  close  situation and may take offense when affection is demonstrated. Parents,  too,  may  object  to  this  type  of  reinforcement, especially with older children. Even children who have been with a practitioner from the age of two or three may be offended by the 'touching' display of affection that is used for reinforcement or rapport maintenance.\nFinally, reinforcements or rewards also can be described as intangible or tangible. Verbal compliments are intangible rewards. Prizes or tokens are tangible and particularly  effective  with  some  patients.  However,  in some offices they are given indiscriminately at the end of  an  appointment.  Rather  than  serving  as  a  reward, they are given automatically and have little meaning."

    "context_enriched_content": "Operant conditioning\nOne  method  of  behavior  modification  that  has  been effective in beneficially altering children's behaviors is operant conditioning. It involves verbal reinforcements followed by tangible rewards. Children are praised verbally, and approval of their behavior is acknowledged. Token  systems  are  used  as  a  tangible  reinforcement. Tokens  may  be  many  different  things:  stars,  points, poker chips, check marks on a chart, or stamps. When the child has accumulated a sufficient number of tokens, they  can  be  exchanged  for  back-up  reinforcements such as toys, badges, a favorite activity, or food (with a    parent's  approval).  The  initial  token  may  not  elicit much  of  a  response  from  a  child,  but  the  back-up reinforcements acquire important reinforcing properties.  Operant  conditioning  usually  occurs  over  several  appointments.  Therefore,  unless  a  child  has  a\nlengthy series of appointments, such as for orthodontic treatment, it likely is not the best strategy to use.\nIt is clear that positive reinforcement is an important part  of  tell-show-do,  behavior  shaping,  and  operant conditioning. It is more than simply saying 'You are a good  helper.'  Rosenberg  (1974)  points  out  that  'one should learn and then practice to praise effectively.' A learned  response  does  not  always  remain  strong,  so reinforcement should occur whenever possible. In S-R theory, consistency is critical when reinforcing behavior or  ignoring  behavior.  Otherwise,  learning  does  not happen."

    "context_enriched_content": "Modeling\nA description of the modeling procedure in conjunction with pre-appointment behavior modification was provided earlier in this chapter. Modeling, however, can also serve as a management technique. It can be useful in many ways, but it is particularly helpful in dealing with the adolescent needle phobic patient. As practicing pediatric  dentists  are  aware,  these  children  present some of the  most  challenging  management  problems. Wright  et  al.  (1983)  described  a  plan,  incorporating psychologically  valid  principles,  to  deal  with  these problem  cases.  Part  of  the  plan  involves  the  use  of nitrous  oxide  analgesia.  However  the  nitrous  oxide sedation  alone  is  likely  to  fail  in  these  difficult  cases. Wright suggests augmenting the procedure with modeling  and  reinforcement.  The  modeling  can  be  done with  a  videotaped  procedure  or  a  live  model.  The advantage of live models is that they can answer questions and explain to the needle phobic patient that they, too, used to be afraid of needles. It is advantageous if the model is of the same sex and close to a similar age. This  procedure  is  an  example  of  expanding  behavior management technology that has been urged by behavioral scientists (Kuhn and Allen 1994)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Voice control\nThis technique was mentioned briefly in the communication section, as it is a communication technique. It is also a management technique. There can be a fine distinction between communication and patient management. The general  goal  of  communication  is  to  impart  understanding,  whereas  that  of  patient  management  is  to encourage cooperative behavior.\nWhen using voice control for management, sudden and firm commands are used to get the child's attention or to stop the her from whatever she is doing. Once the dentist has the child's attention, conversation should revert to a  quieter  tone.  Monotonous,  soothing  conversation  is supposed to function like relaxing music to set the mood.\nChambers (1976) theorized that voice control is most effective when used in conjunction with other communication, such as tapping a child on the chest or clapping the hands loudly. In these cases, it is what is heard that is important because the dentist is attempting to influence behavior directly and not through understanding. A sudden command to 'stop crying and listen to me' may  be  a  necessary  preliminary  measure,  preparing the way for future communication. The same message shouted  in  a  foreign  language  would  probably  be equally effective in stopping disruptive patient behavior that is preventing proper communication.\nTurner et al. (1988) conducted one of the few studies to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  voice  control.  Study subjects three to seven years old were assessed as potential management problems and were assigned randomly to  an  experimental  group  (voice  control  group)  or  a control group (no voice control). Restorative treatment was performed and treatment sessions were videotaped. Whenever behavior interfered with treatment, the dentist  used  firm  voice  tones.  In  the  group  with  no  voice control,  if  the  children  misbehaved,  the  dentist  asked them  to  desist  in  a  normal,  conversational  voice.  The investigators  found  that  children  in  the  voice  control group  showed  less  disruptive  behavior  immediately after the use of a firm voice than the no-voice counterparts. This is one of the few studies to provide empirical data on this technique.\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (2012) succinctly stated that voice control guidelines are (1) to gain the patient's attention and compliance, (2) to avert negative  or  avoidance  behavior,  and  (3)  to  establish adult-child roles. The latter refers to establishing authority in dealing with the uncooperative and inattentive but communicative child patient. The dentist, however, must realize that this technique is not acceptable to all parents. In Eaton's study (2005), voice control was in the lower range of acceptability; therefore, if a parent is present, they should be informed about the technique beforehand."

    "context_enriched_content": "Desensitization\nAnother method of behavior modification used in dentistry  is  desensitization.  Systematic  desensitization,  or reciprocal inhibition as described by Wolpe (1969), is the elimination of anxiety response habits by first presenting  a  stimulus  that  evokes  a  mild  response.  When  it no longer causes anxiety, progressively stronger stimuli are  introduced  until  direct  control  is  exerted  over  the strongest  anxiety-producing  stimulus.  Desensitization involves  patient  training  in  progressive  deep  muscle relaxation. The bond between the stimulus and the anxiety is gradually weakened in the presence of relaxation.\nAnxiety  and  deep  muscle  relaxation  are  incompatible and do not occur together.\nUnless the clinician is very keen to use this technique, desensitization may be impractical for use in the dental office. It is time-consuming. The clinician also requires special training for it to be effective. It has been included, however, for the clinician to gain an understanding of the technique and to realize that some psychologists can help dental patients by using this approach."

    "context_enriched_content": "Contingency and distraction techniques\nDistracting a child from a potentially difficult or painful procedure  is  a  well-established  technique  in  pediatric dentistry (Allen et al. 1990;Ingersoll et al. 1984; Venham et al. 1981). Many types of audio-visual distractors have been  used  in  either  a  contingent  or  non-contingent format, some of which are described in Chapter Sixteen. Verbal  distraction  also  is  used  effectively  during  local administration.\nOverall, contingency studies have yielded mixed results. Nonetheless, they offer some interesting approaches to behavior management and may be the way of the future. They are also practical as the clinician does not have to invest in special training or equipment. The  two contingency  techniques  that  have  received  attention from behavioral scientists are contingent distraction and contingent  escape  (Kuhn  and  Allen  1994).  Both  are designed  for  the  child  who  is  not  cooperating  in  the dental clinic.\nIngersoll  and  colleagues  (1984)  suggested  that  children's  disruptive  behavior  can  be  reduced  by  using  a distractor  such  as  an  audio  tape,  which  is  dependent (contingent)  on  cooperative  behavior,  as  opposed  to providing unlimited access to audio tapes. In the experimental  group,  three-  to  nine-year-old  children  were informed  that  they  could  listen to taped  material through headphones as long as they were cooperative. If the  child  became  disruptive  or  uncooperative,  the dentist immediately terminated the audio presentation and did not reinstate it until the child exhibited cooperative  behavior.  The  children  in  the  contingent  group decreased  levels  of  disruptive  behavior,  whereas  the non-contingent control group had no behavioral change.\nContingent  escape  takes  advantage  of  the  powerful motivation to escape, and uses it to promote more cooperative behaviors. It is based on 'raising the hand' to stop treatment, which is a non-verbal management technique that allows a child some control over the dental routine.  In  contingent  escape,  brief  periods  of  escape from ongoing dental treatment are provided contingent upon cooperative behavior.  Instead  of  raising  a  hand, the child can receive praise and brief escape from dental treatment  by  simply  being  very  still  and  quiet.  Any disruptive  behavior  by  the  child  delays  escape  until cooperation is regained.\nContingent escape is based on well-established learning principles and is designed to not only diminish undesirable behavior, but to increase   desirable  behaviors  (Kuhn  and  Allen  1994).  Delayed  consequences not  tied  to  specific  behaviors  fail  to  teach  children how to behave. Contingent escape provides immediate feedback to teach children more adaptive coping behaviors."

    "context_enriched_content": "Visual Imagery\nIn the original edition of this book, there was a chapter on  hypnosis.  Hypnosis  is  not  used  by  many  practitioners today. It is time consuming and requires special training, so it has been  omitted.  However,  visual imagery, which seems to be hypnosis-based, is a technique that can be helpful in certain situations. The visual imagery  technique  is  believed  to  work  with  children because they have good ability to imagine and fantasize. The  approach  may  be  effective  for  the  elimination  of phobic behavior without the disadvantage of the time required to train the patient in relaxation techniques.\nAyer (1973) describes visual imagery where children were asked to imagine that they were playing with their dogs and that the dogs were yelping louder and louder. The children were asked to open their mouths and sit as still as possible. The clinician talked constantly throughout the visits, distracting the children with the imagined setting.\nAyer  reported  on  the  successful  treatment  of  three ten-year-old  patients  who  were  identified  as  needle phobic.  All  of  the  children  cooperated  fully  and  displayed  only  moderate  anxieties  during  the  injections. Each child had three appointments during which extractions were completed. Subsequent contact with the parents  of  these  children,  as  well  as  the  children's  own comments, indicated that the youngsters were no longer fearful of injections and they were now model patients.\nAyer emphasizes an important ingredient for effecting  behavior  change,  indicating  that  a  necessary  variable in the successful application of behavioral change techniques-and  one  that  is  seldom  noted-is  time. Behavior change requires both time and patience on the part of the clinician. The time factor, he theorizes, may be one of the main reasons that the recommendations of behavioral scientists are so slow to be implemented in the dental office.\nAyer's writing seems to have gotten lost in the historical literature. Those interested in using visual imagery will find it well worth their time to read Ayer's original paper.  The  technique  has  application  in  the  dental office-particularly  with  needle  phobic  adolescents.\nIf  the  Ayer  technique  is  combined  with  nitrous  oxide analgesia, it can be extremely effective in solving needle phobic cases (Wright 1979)."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Use of Humor\nPlanned humor assessment and interventions are relatively recent in medical and dental care. However, in recent years there has been a general acceptance of the role  of  humor  in  building  and  maintaining  relationships,  emotional  health,  and  cognitive  function.  This part  of  the  chapter  will  discuss  the  development  of humor and how it can be used to improve conventional management  techniques.  An  understanding  of  this development will assist pediatric dentists in anticipating the  various  types  of  humor  unique  to  each  stage  of childhood and develop individualized humor interventions (Dowling 2002).\nTwo main theories explain the functions of humor: the relief  theory  and  the  incongruity  theory. According  to the relief theory, which focuses on the relief of tension, people experience humor  and  engage  in laughter because  they  sense  that  stress  is  reduced  in  doing  so (Kuiper et al. 1993). The incongruity theory focuses on contradictions between expectations and experiences. It purports that people laugh at things that surprise them or  that  violate  an  accepted  pattern-with  a  difference close enough to the norm to be non-threatening, but different enough to be remarkable. The incongruity theory emphasizes cognition (Wilkins and Eisenbraun 2009).\nA full discourse on humor theory is beyond the scope of this text, but certain basic definitions are essential. From  a  psychological  perspective,  humor  involves cognitive, emotional, behavioral, psycho-  physiological, and social aspects (Mora-Ripoll 2010). In general, the term 'humor' can refer to a stimulus (such as a video), which is intended to produce a humorous   reaction-a mental process (perception of amusing incongruities) or  a  response  (laughter,  exhilaration).  Humor  and laughter are typically associated with a pleasant emotional state. For the purpose of this discussion, humor is  defined  as  a  stimulus  that  helps  people  laugh  and feel happy. Laughter is a psychophysiological response to humor that involves both characteristic physiological reactions  and  positive  psychological  shifts.  Sense  of humor is a psychological trait that varies considerably and  allows  a  person  to  respond  to  different  types  of humorous stimuli.\nUsing a cognitive approach to humor, McGhee (2002) developed a theory which traces the development and appreciation  of  humor  in  children  through  defined stages and continues to form the framework for research in this area. It contains six stages, each based on the children's cognitive abilities that enable them to recognize and produce cognitive incongruities (Cunningham 2005). A summary and description of these stages is presented  in  Table  6-5.  The  first  two  stages  of  child development (Stages Zero and One) are interesting, but Stage Two (12-15 months to 3-5 years) and later stages have more clinical relevance. Understanding the developmental stages can be of practical benefit to dentists who  are  interested  in  using  humor  effectively  in  the dental setting."

    "context_enriched_content": "Treating an Object as a Different Object\nAt Stage Two, children begin producing 'jokes' nonverbally by performing incongruous actions such as putting a bowl on their head as a hat or pretending to talk into their shoe. These jokes are any incongruous actions with an object. Another form of typical humor is using the correct object,  but  applying it to  the  wrong object; for\nTable 6-5. Stages Of Children's Humor as described by McGhee (2002). Reproduced with permission of Paul McGhee.\n\nStage 0: First 6 months. Laughter without humor (the pre-humor stage)., Example = Tickling.

Riddles and jokes., Dental Application = Q.What flowers are the kissing flowers? A. Tulips. Q.Why did the tree come to the dentist? A. To get a root canal.\nexample, the child may ask: 'Brush ear?' In these cases, the same behavior may be just as funny if it is the mother, father, or another sibling who initiates it (McGhee 2010). This  stage  is  significant  since  it  presents  the  earliest self-created  humor.  It  is  the  parallel  of  incongruous actions toward objects from the initial McGhee system of humor development.\nIn  Stage  Three,  children  from  two  to  three  or  four years of age begin to misname objects or actions. Once the  child's  vocabulary  increases,  the  young  child  can extend  incongruity  humor  to  misnaming  objects  or actions: calling a cat a dog, calling a shoe a sock. After age two, parents are asked by their child to name people and things. Toddlers are very excited by the realization that everything has a name, and they begin playing with those  names.  Many parents first  see  this  new  form  of humor in the 'Show me your nose' game. Even if the parent  has  always  played  the  game  straight,  the  day always arrives when the child is prompted to 'Show me your nose,' and exhibits a mischievous grin and points to his or her ear. The child may or may not laugh, but there's no doubt that this is pretty funny to them."

    "context_enriched_content": "Treating an Object as a Different Object\nAt Stage Four, children ages three to five years start to play with word sounds, if not their meanings. As children's verbal competence grows, they are less dependent on objects as the source of humor. The preschooler may experiment with rhyming words, made-up silly words, and other humorous play that does not directly link to concrete objects within their reach. Many children are especially  fond  of  the  verbal  expression  of  humor found in stories and poems like Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat. Humor includes playing with word sounds-not meanings-altering  funny  words  or  creating  nonsense words.  Children  become  attuned  to  the  way  words sound, and begin playing with the sounds themselves. This  often  takes  the  form  of  repeating  variations  of  a familiar  word  over  and  over,  such  as:  'daddy,  faddy, paddy' or 'silly, dilly, willy, squilly' (McGhee 2002). In the latter part of this stage, previously labeled 'Conceptual incongruity,' there is a dramatic change in the form of humor which emerges due to the fact that children begin to develop conceptual thought (Louizi 2006). Humor is centered  on  violations  of  conceptual  representations: conceptual  incongruity  (McGhee  1979). An  example  of humor based on violation of conceptual representations is a cartoon of a picture of a bicycle with square wheels, or an elephant sitting on a tree limb (Dowling 2002).\nIn Stage Five, at ages six or seven to ten or eleven years, a  general shift in children's humor toward riddles and jokes begins to occur. While the general silliness common in much of the humor in younger children's physical play is still present, there is a gradual reduction in the degree of  reliance  on  physical  action  for  humor.  The  defining feature of this stage is the acquisition of a new level of cognitive functioning, which permits simultaneous awareness of double meanings of the same word-the key  to  getting  a  riddle.  (e.g.,  Q.  What  are  the  kissing flowers?  A.  Tulips.)  The  shift  that  occurs  in  children's humor  at  about  age  seven  is  more  striking  than  that shown at any other age (McGhee 2002). By seven, most children make the exciting discovery that the same word can have two different meanings, and that one can use this revelation to trick others. As they develop, they begin to  understand  that  humor  has  a  meaning-that  jokes must resolve from something absurd into something that makes cognitive sense. The pediatric dentist should consider the child's stage of humor development and design and employ the proper use of age-appropriate humor.\nAlthough the role of humor in health has been emphasized in recent years, little has been written about using humor as a communicative tool with children (D'Antonio 1989), particularly in dentistry (Nevo and Shapira 1986). Since  humor  reduces  the  emotional  distance  between people, it has the potential to improve communication not only with children, but with parents as well (Bennett 1996). Humor can assist the pediatric dentist on all levels by relieving anxiety and pain, and establishing a direct path of communication with a new child patient."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.11\nSue,  age  four,  arrived  for  her  visit  accompanied  by  her older  sister Ann,  age  seven,  and  their  mother.  Dr.  Patty came  into  the waiting room  to  greet the patient. She  asked  Sue  what  her  name  was.  Sue  ignored  her. She asked her how old she was; Sue refused to answer. Dr. Patty tried one more time; she complimented Sue on her shoes and asked where she got them. Sue ran behind her mother and refused to speak with the dentist. Sue's mom showed signs of apprehension.\nCase 6.11, Discussion : Greeting patients is the first part of the dental encounter and experience. It often sets the tone for the entire visit. One of the most critical challenges facing the dentist during the patient's first visit is opening up a direct channel of communication with the child, effectively bypassing the parent and talking directly to the patient. Some of the well-known techniques  to  open  communication  are  complimenting  a child about their clothing or asking their name or age. Dr. Patty tried all of these greetings, but Sue refused to communicate with her.\nIn cases like this, humor can be used to achieve effective communication in several ways. Asking a child their age is often followed by a non-verbal response: they may\nidentify their age by holding up the appropriate number of fingers. At this point the dentist may employ humor to break the ice by miscalculating the age or exaggerating the age: 'Oh, you are already eight!' the child being only four or five. If two siblings are present, and one is obviously  taller  and  older  as  in  the  case,  the  conversation begins:  'Who  is  older?'  Addressing  the  obviously younger child, 'Are you older than your sister? I thought you were older but just shorter.' Or, as in our case, if the older  child  answers  and  identifies  herself  as  Ann,  the dentist turns to the younger sibling and asks if her name is also Ann. Most children will immediately answer with a smile and laugh-their name is not Ann! The parent will  also  laugh  in  the  background  and  the  child  will excitedly  reply  that  her  name  is  Sue.  Once  the  child reacts and answers the dentist, the channel of communication  has  opened.  Conversation  may  continue,  'I  am happy to meet you. By the way, my name is Dr. Patty, what is your name? I forgot!' Most children now will reply  with  their  name.  Most  importantly,  the  effect  of humor is cumulative and children relax, expecting more fun  to  occur.  Humor  also  affects  parents,  who  in  turn radiate a relaxed feeling to their children.\nHumor can continue. Bennett (2003) suggested asking about the characters with whom children identify, and then  making  mistakes.  'Winnie  the  Pooh  is  a  horse, right?' While tapping teeth, the dentist can make silly noises. Tap the nose. Get mixed up while counting teeth. During the use of nitrous oxide the child is instructed to breathe 'through your nose and not through your toes, it's hard to breathe through shoes!' Ask the patient, 'Do you like pickles, shmickels or tickles?'\nWhatever  you  do,  it  is  important  for  the  dentist  to adopt  a  style  that  is  comfortable  and  natural.  The cumulative  humor  effect  creates  a  good  feeling,  and parents and children anticipate returning for their next visit with a smile."

Most dentists welcome a parent in the  treatment  room  as  long  as  the  child  behaves. Dentists are able to demonstrate their expertise to parents when their patients cooperate. The problem arises when  the  dentist  must  deal  with  an  uncooperative, defiant  child.

In the functional inquiry it was learned that Bobby had visited  two  other  dentists  unsuccessfully,  leaving  the offices without an exam. His mother had mentioned to the dental receptionist that other dentists were incapable  of  getting  him  to  open  his  mouth  for  an examination.\nBobby  was  now  seated  on  the  dental  chair.  When Dr.  Steve asked him to open his mouth, he refused. He also refused to answer questions such as 'what's your name?'  Ignoring  the  question,  Bobby  made  a  face toward his mother. At this point, his mother jumped into the conversation and answered on his behalf: 'Bobby.'\nDr.  Steve:  'How  old  are  you?'  Once  again,  Bobby ignored  the  dentist.  Dr.  Steve  responded  with  a  stern and  disappointed  look.  Seeing  the  dentist's  reaction, Mommy reassured Bobby: 'The dentist won't hurt you! He  won't  do  anything  to  you!  I'll  stay  with  you  the whole time!' She moved her chair closer to Bobby and held his hand.\nDr. Steve told Bobby that he must open his mouth so he  could  count  his  teeth.  Bobby  ignored  him.  When asked again, Bobby screamed. Dr. Steve asked Bobby to stop screaming so that he could hear what he has to say. Bobby looked at his mother. Ignoring the dentist, the child placed his hands on his ears and screamed. Dr. Steve responded in a firm but controlled voice, displaying  displeasure  with  Bobby's  behavior:  'Bobby, place  your  hands  on  your  lap!  You're  expected  to behave in here.'\nThe dentist gently tried to move Bobby's hands away from his ears. Immediately, the child's mother interrupted and sternly told the dentist not to touch Bobby. She said with obvious annoyance: 'Dr. Steve, Bobby will behave better if you don't get angry with him and use that tone of voice.'\nCase 6.12, Discussion : For a dentist to deliver safe and effective dentistry to a child, a proper pediatric dental triangle needs to be established. In the scenario described, this was not the case. The child did not relate to the parent and dentist as a team. Rather, the parent\nacted as the child's surrogate or protector, shielding him from  the  dentist.  The  ultimate  authority  in  the  dental office, in the child's view, was the parent, not the dentist. Dr.  Steve  was  up  against  both  Bobby  and  his  mother, reflecting  a  non-functional  pediatric  dental  triangle  as denoted  by  Figure  5-2.  A  change  needs  to  be  made immediately to create a functioning pediatric dental triangle. The dentist has to gain control of the situation. The child has to understand that the dentist and parent are  on  the  same  team.  He  needs  to  pay  attention  and communicate directly with the dentist. In this type of situation, parental exclusion or separation may be used to re-establish the proper child-dentist-parent relationship. Once a parent is asked to leave the operatory, and the child adjusts to the new relationship, the parent may return. If the child's behavior reverts to the former negativity, the parent again is asked to leave. This scenario may  repeat  itself  one  or  two  times.  Everyone  has  to understand that the parent's role is passive and the dentist is in charge. When this has been established, the parent  may  remain  in  the  room.  Ideally,  less  aversive management techniques will be effective to recondition the child.\nParents should know what their role is in the operatory. In a case such as this one it is critical, and the dentist has to educate parents about their role to ultimately achieve  positive  behavior  modification.  The  parent should be instructed to ignore minor disruptive behavior and refrain from coaxing or pleading with the child  to  accept  dental  treatment.  When  the  'game plan' is explained to parents in advance, even reluctant  parents  will  cooperate.  Specifically,  regarding parental separation, they need to be told to accept the situation when asked to leave, despite the anticipated pleas of their child. They also should be instructed not"

Following  the  initial  telephone  contact,  the receptionist  should  note  that  the  child  is  a  potential problem and alert the dentist that the child and parent will need special consultation time. The child's age and previous dental history are red flags regarding the type of patient management techniques that may need to be used to obtain proper patient cooperation. Before entering  the  treatment  room,  Dr.  Steve  should  have invited  Bobby's  mother  to  the  bridging  room,  leaving Bobby in the play area.

All rights reserved.\npossible  injuries  to  the  child  and/or  dentist  (Roberts et  al.  2010).  A  wide  range  of  techniques  and  devices have been used in the past to accomplish restraint, ranging  from  holding  a  child's  head  with  one  hand  to  a whole body wrap, Papoose Board, or bed sheet (Frankel 1991). The use of protective stabilization, known in the past  as  passive  restraint,  is  an  invasive  technique. Currently, it is seen by parents as one of the least favorable  methods  of  patient  management  (see  Table  6-4). When  parents  are  presented  with  two  options,  one involving restraint and the other no restraint, many opt for  the  non-restraining  mode  of  treatment  delivery. Indeed, studies have shown that more parents consent to  general  anesthesia  than  conscious  sedation  with passive  restraint  (Allen  et  al.  1995;  Eaton  et  al.  2005). However,  restraint still has a function in patient management and is part of the armamentarium of some pediatric dentists.\nProtective stabilization is mostly used in conjunction with  conscious  sedation,  but  it  may  be  indicated  in specific clinical situations without sedation. For example,  an  eighteen-month-old  child  appears  in  the office with a traumatic injury, an extruded upper incisor. A  radiograph  is  needed.  An  attempt  to  take  the  film with the child held by the parent fails. A speedy and harmless solution is to place the child in a restraining device with the parent holding the film in place. The procedure could not be accomplished without any form of restraint.\nThe use of restraint becomes more complicated when considering an older child, perhaps three to five year of age, who requires comprehensive restorative treatment. The dilemma is, should uncooperative preschoolers be treated with protective stabilization coupled with conscious  sedation,  or  is  treatment  under  general  anesthesia  the  better  alternative? A  survey  by Adair  et  al. (2004) of behavior management teaching in advanced pediatric dentistry training programs showed that 98% of the   programs taught that the use of protective stabilization using a restraining device such as a Pediwrap or Papoose board was acceptable for use on the sedated child (see Figure 6-7). However, this is not a universal viewpoint.  The  exclusion  of  any  form  of  restraining device has become mainstream practice and the standard  of  care  in  many  parts  of  Europe.  In  the  United Kingdom,  restraining  devices  are  not  acceptable  in dental practices under any circumstances (Manley 2004; Morris 2004).\nPositive  explanations  may  result  in  more  parents' acceptance  of  this  form  of  treatment.  Kupietzky  and Ram (2005) showed that parents who received a positive explanation  about  restraint  showed  higher  acceptance levels than parents who received a neutral or noncommittal explanation. Consider this clinical case.\nFigure 6-7 The Papoose Board with head immobilizer restraint apparatus (Olympic Medical Group, Seattle, WA) used together with a pediatric Rainbow ® wrap (Specialized Care Co., Hampton, NH)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 6.13\nA four-year-old child was unsuccessfully treated by a general dentist who used restraint without any premedication or local anesthesia. The parents turned to a qualified pediatric dentist for assistance. The child was successfully treated  with  restraint  and  conscious  sedation.  After treatment, the child was asked by his mother how he felt. He answered that he did not like  the  previous  dentist. 'Why?' asked the mother. The child answered, 'Because he tied me up!' 'But this dentist did the same,' said the mother.  The  child  answered,  'No  he  didn't,  he  put  a blanket on me and helped me not to move so he could fix my teeth and they won't hurt me anymore.' The child was seen subsequently throughout and became an enthusiastic dental patient with good dental health.\nCase  6.13,  Discussion :  Before  using  medical  stabilization, the parents should be given an honest explanation regarding its use. Depending on the age of the child, an explanation should also be given to the patient. 'We will use a blanket. It will help you to not move and it will keep  you  warm.' An  excellent  prop  available  for  the discussion is a doll in a Pediwrap (see Figure 6-8).\nThe  acceptance  of  restraints  by  parents,  and  more importantly their success in helping to instill a positive acceptance of dentistry by the child patient, depends, to a large degree, on the frame of mind of the dentist using the techniques. If restraint is used punitively, or out or a sense  of  anger  or  frustration,  then  it  is  unacceptable (Roberts et al. 2010).\nFigure  6-8.

    "context_enriched_content": "Hand-over-mouth (HOM)\nWhen  the  first  edition  of  this  book  was  written,  the HOM technique was generally accepted. However, over the  past  two  decades  it  has  gradually  become  less acceptable to parents (Eaton 2005) and to the profession. In  2006  it  was  no  longer  endorsed  by  the  American Academy  of  Pediatric  Dentistry  guidelines  (AAPD 2006). The teaching of HOM in post graduate programs has  also  declined  dramatically,  with  only  28%  of  the programs teaching it as an acceptable technique (Adair et al. 2004). With these attitudes in mind, there was some reluctance on the part of the authors to include this technique with current management procedures. However, a  guideline  is  a  standard  to  help  one  determine  the course  of  action.  It  is  not  legally  binding,  nor  does  it restrict practice, and HOM continues to be used today. Oueiss  et  al.  (2010)  surveyed  members  of  the  AAPD, finding that 350 of 704 respondents (50%) believed that HOM  was  an  acceptable  technique.  Similar  findings were obtained by Newton et al. (2004), who surveyed pediatric  dental  specialists  in  the  United  Kingdom. While 60% were of the opinion that HOM should never be used, 40% favored its use under certain conditions. There  were  other  reasons  for  including  HOM  in  this chapter. In some countries it is accepted. In others, the acceptability is not even discussed. There are countries where  pediatric  dentists  are  legally  prevented  from using  pharmacological  approaches,  often  do  not  have access to general anesthesia, and have limited alternatives  for  managing  their  child  patients.  For  these  reasons, it was decided to include HOM in this chapter. It will be discussed by describing the indications for the technique,  the  technique  itself,  its  psychological  rationale, and the controversy surrounding it."

    "context_enriched_content": "Indications\nIf  a  child's  behavior  is  uncontrolled  and  the  child thrashes about in the dental chair, a potentially dangerous situation develops. There is a possibility that a  child  may  cause  physical  injury  to  their  person. Controlling  this  type  of  behavior  may  require  strong sedation techniques, or perhaps the use of general anesthesia. Hand-over-mouth offers an alternative method. It  is  an  invasive,  non-pharmacologic  method  that  is most often used during a first office visit.\nThe  major  purpose  of  the  technique  is  to  control the  child's  behavior  after  other  non-pharmacologic approaches have been tried. It is a method of last resort. It enables the dentist to establish communication so that the child can learn the appropriate responses and expectations. HOM is most effective for gaining the attention of children three to six years of age. Before applying the technique, a child should have been prejudged to be of normal intelligence and be able to follow instructions. HOM is not used for children under three years of age who lack the ability to comprehend their situation. The technique is also not used in conjunction with sedation. Children should have a complete awareness of their surroundings when their behavior is modified through this approach."

    "context_enriched_content": "Technique\nWhen all avenues of communication have failed and the child's behavior remains uncontrolled, HOM is applied. Control  must  be  considered  from  two  points  of  view: (1)  the  explicit  emphasis of the technique is control of the child's behavior, and (2) the implied meaning of control is a mastery of emotions by the dentist. The latter can be somewhat difficult following several minutes of kicking, screaming, or fighting. Nevertheless, the dentist's response must be a controlled one. There should be no display of anger or annoyance. The approach must be  as  unemotional  as  possible,  almost  matter-of-fact. Failure  to  control  personal  emotions  may  result  in improper  behavior  management,  and  thus  defeat  the dentist's  purpose.  The  critical  details  of  the  technique are as follows:\n- Place the hand over the child's mouth to muffle the noise.\n- Bring your face close to the child and talk directly into the ear.\n- Quietly, tell the child to stop screaming and listen, and then you will remove the hand.\n- Explain  that  you  'only  want  to  talk  and  look  at your teeth.'\nFigure 6-9. Hand-over-mouth technique is shown with the dentist in close proximity to the child. Use of the technique is highly controversial, but many think it still has a place in pediatric dentistry.\n- Repeat the instructions after a few seconds, adding: 'Are you ready for me to remove my hand?'\n- Caution  the  child  to  be  quiet  when  the  hand  is removed.\nIt is difficult to describe all the details of the technique in this section. The dentist's position in close proximity to  the  child's  ear  is  of  major  importance  (see  Figure 6-9). Using a soft, monotone voice makes it necessary for the child patient to become quiet so that instructions  are  audible.  The  dentist's  directions  must  be specific. Members of the dental health team also need to understand the technique prior to the situation. The dental assistant must know her role. In some cases, it will  be  to  firmly  grasp  the  child's  leg  and  prevent kicking.  In  other  cases,  it  will  be  to  intercept  the patient's  hands  so  there  is  no  interference  with  the dentist or scratching of the face. There are several variations of the standard technique. Those interested in learning more about them can obtain the information in earlier writings."

    "context_enriched_content": "Rationale for the technique\nHand-over-mouth or aversive conditioning has a psychological  basis.  From  the  behavior  modification viewpoint,  the  laws  of  learning  are  applicable  to  the HOM technique. When a child's behavior is uncontrolled and a hand is placed over the child's mouth to quell the noise, there is a coupling of the active maladaptive act with an unpleasant experience. Immediate punishment of  this  type  lessens  the  likelihood  of  the  behavior recurring  (Azrin  et  al.  1963).  The  requirements  of  an ideal  punishing stimulus are: it should have a precise physical specification, it should be constantly in contact with the patient, and the patient should not be able to escape or minimize it by unauthorized behavior. HOM meets these requirements.\nThe  temporal  relationship  has  importance  in  the HOM  conditioning  treatment.  Once  the  HOM  technique is instituted, the child must cooperate. When the hand is removed, if the child begins to fight or cry out, the  hand  is  immediately  replaced  and  the  patient  is again  told  that  when  the  hand  is  removed,  he  must cooperate, be quiet, open his mouth, and listen to the dentist. The close association between the fighting and crying and the physical restraint is learned quickly and effectively  if  little  or  no  time  is  allowed  between  the response  and  the  stimulus.  Chambers  (1970),  Craig (1972),  and  Levitas  (1974)  pointed  out  that  once  the desired  behavior  is  elicited  by  the  hand-over-mouth technique,  reward  conditioning  procedures  are  instituted immediately. The child is given social verbal reinforcement for behaving properly. Tangible rewards can be given at the end of the visit."

    "context_enriched_content": "The controversy\nWhenever the hand-over-mouth technique has been discussed  or  demonstrated  in  the  past,  there  have  been strong opposing views regarding its application in the dental environment. It is difficult to discuss the controversy without considering the historical writing.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, HOM was a widely accepted management technique. Leaders in pediatric dentistry supported its use in text books at the time (Finn 1963; McDonald  1963;  Kramer  1974;  Levitas  1974;  Wright 1975). There was also evidence of acceptance of the technique in dental practice. A 1972 survey of Diplomates of the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry revealed that 80% of the respondents used physical restraint or some form  of  HOM  for  selected  cases.  Comparable  results were found in Craig's study (1972) in the state of Indiana. His  survey  found  twenty-eight  of  thirty-five  pediatric dental specialists used HOM in practice.\nThe technique became controversial, as not everyone was in agreement with the use of HOM. One reason was the apparent harshness of the technique. Some   contended that the management method was unscientific and that it could possibly cause psychological trauma to the child patient  (Davies  and  King  1961;  MacGregor  1952).  No scientific  data  has  ever  been  presented to support this viewpoint.  Indeed,  the  opinions  of  psychiatrists  and psychologists  were  opposite,  and  they  advocated  for HOM usage (Goering 1972; Chambers 1970).\nIn the 1980s, the use of HOM became more controversial.  Issues  were  being  raised,  however,  concerning informed  consent  and  the  potential  for  committing battery (Bowers 1982). Shortly thereafter,  Schuman (1987) reported that several dentists who had used HOM had been charged with child abuse or criminal assault\nfollowing  routine  dental  procedures.  That  same  year, HOM was singled out by the Virginia Board of Dentistry as a procedure leading to the report of child abuse against dentists (Virginia 1987). In 1993, Casamassimo opined in an editorial that the technique was harsh, raising further legal  concern.  Thus,  pediatric  dentists  became  very concerned about its use in their practices.\nSome  clinicians  employ  only  gentle  psychological methods for managing children. The majority of pediatric dentists, however, use some restraint at one time or another. Emphatically pushing a hand downward which had been raised inadvertently or intentionally to interfere with treatment or lifting a resisting child and forcibly seating the patient in the dental chair to convey a 'no-nonsense'  attitude  are  forms  of  restraint.  These techniques  often  precede  the  use  of  HOM.  However, change has  gradually  occurred  in  the  management  of children in pediatric dentistry, and it can be attributed to many  factors.  Casamassimo  et  al.  (2002)  surveyed Diplomates of the American Board to determine some of the changes. Based on their findings, most diplomates were of the opinion that parenting styles had changed, and almost 60% felt that their children's behaviors were worse. The relevant changes in practice procedures were a  decrease  in  the  use  of  restraints  and  HOM  and  an increase in sedation usage."

    "context_enriched_content": "The controversy\nDespite current attitudes, it is likely that some pediatric  dentists  will  continue  using  restraint  and  HOM. Barton et al. (1993) contend that, used properly, the technique can be kind and effective. Acs et  al.  (1990)  surveyed utilization of HOM and restraint in postdoctoral pediatric  dental  education  programs  and  compared their findings to an earlier survey by Davis and Rombom (1979). Interestingly, the Acs survey found a discrepancy in professional standards. It seems that program directors with tenures in excess of ten years are more likely to teach  HOM  and/or  restraint  than  their  younger  colleagues.  Hassan  et  al.  (2010)  conducted  a  survey  to determine the alternatives for HOM after it was eliminated  from  the  AAPD  guidelines.  The  respondents selected voice control as the first alternative,  and minimum  to  moderate  sedation  as  the  second.  Since voice control likely had been tried in many cases before using HOM, the only real alternative to HOM is sedation  or  general  anesthesia.  Many  clinicians  consider HOM a much safer method of child management than the pharmacologic techniques."

    "context_enriched_content": "5. retraining\nRetraining,  like  behavior  shaping,  fits  the  learning theorist's model of a behavior modification program. Children's responses to the dental situation are altered in accordance with an established set of rules. Rewards are given for positive behavior to reinforce the learning. Negative behavior may  be  ignored or punished. Indeed, the theory for retraining and behavior shaping is somewhat similar. The clinical difference, however, is that retraining begins with a child possessing negative expectancies and undesirable responses. The behavior may be the result of a previous dental visit or the effect of improper parental or perhaps peer orientation. If the source of the problem can be determined, it  is  obviously  helpful,  for  then  the  problem  can  be avoided  through  another  technique,  or  de-emphasized, or a distraction method can be used. These ploys begin the retraining program which eventually leads to behavior shaping.\nWhen encountering negative behavior, the objective is  to  build  a  new  series  of  associations  in  the  child's mind. In other words, the goal is to alter the stimulus and response. At the outset, state that 'we do things differently here.' When the child's expectancy of being hurt is not reinforced, then a new set of expectancies is learned. The child realizes that the dentist has followed through  and  did  not  hurt  him-the  dentist  can  be trusted. This same child develops a new perception of or relationship to the dental office, the dentist, and dentistry itself. In the language of learning theory, the child patient extinguished an unacceptable behavior learned previously  and  began  to  discriminate  between  this office-where anxieties and fears were not necessarily companions-and the last office, where they were present.  The  fearful  child  with  anxieties  modeled  from parents and peers can go back to them and boast about learning something.\nAssuming  that  communication  is  possible,  when beginning  the  retraining  process  several  ploys  can  be helpful in revising children's expectancies. Avoidance is possibly the most difficult route, for some procedures simply must be carried out. However, if an immature three-year-old patient who recently underwent a poor dental experience presented with a deep carious lesion, it might be possible to avoid extensive pulp therapy at this time by applying a temporizing medication and utilizing an indirect pulp therapy procedure. This allows the final treatment to be delayed until a more opportune visit. Once the child has been retrained and expectancies have  been  revised,  future  treatment  becomes  much easier.  Thus,  avoidance  at  the  outset  can  be  a  worthwhile strategy.\nIf  older  children  present  with  histories  of  negative behavior, they can be queried about their dislikes. Some children  may  express  an  intense  dislike  for  materials such as certain prophylaxis pastes or topical fluorides. It is  a  simple  matter  to  agree  with  the  child  and  offer  a choice  of  different  brands.  The  fact  that  a  choice  is\noffered indicates to the child that you have recognized their dislike and that you are prepared to work around the  problem.  Offering  a  choice  also  gives  the  patient some  control  of  the  situation.  The  techniques  of  deemphasizing  or  substituting  help  to  alter  the  child's expectancies.\nA third ploy, distraction, can be used in many ways. Very young children become restless during long procedures. While working, the dentist can tell the child a story, taking  the  child's  mind  off  the  immediate  situation. Additionally,  through  the  proper  use  of  the  voice,  a certain security can be imparted to the child. Counting the number of teeth aloud serves to hold the attention of the young patient during the initial visit. Counting the seconds helps to distract the child who dislikes a fluoride treatment. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the use of humor in these situations helps to relieve children's anxieties. Thus, there are innumerable ways in which dentists can provide distraction during the course of treatment."

    "context_enriched_content": "5. retraining\nChoice  of  words  during  retraining  is  highly  important, no matter how innocuous the procedure. It is not wise to ask, 'Would you like me to clean your teeth?' By phrasing the question in this manner, the dentist offers an  option  that  was  not  intended.  A  better  alternative would have been, 'Do you want the fruit- or peppermint-flavored toothpaste?' The choice is there, but the procedure  is  not  open  to  question.  Allowing  choices gives the child a feeling of control of the situation. It is a key technique for independence training.\nThere are times when it is necessary to use a form of aversive  conditioning  in  combination  with  retraining ploys. If an undesirable response occurs, whether inadvertent  or  intentional,  the  clinician  may  say,  'No,  not that  way'  or  'Stop  that'  or  something  similar.  The sound of the voice changes from a 'matter-of-fact' soft tone to an almost harsh, loud or businesslike tone. Azrin et  al.  (1963)  demonstrated  that  mild  punishment  suppresses a response if an alternative response is available for obtaining reinforcement. The child who is a behavior problem  at  the  beginning  of  the  visit  will  probably receive  social  aversive  conditioning  by  way  of  voice control from the operator more often than the child who cooperates  from  the  outset.  The  end-result,  however, should  be  the  same-an  amenable  child  undergoing successful dental treatment.\nRetraining children can be very satisfying to a clinician. At the outset, a child may exhibit negative behavior in response to inner anxiety or past experiences. Their fearfulness  is  generalized  to  all  dentists.  Eventually, the child learns that this dental office is different from a  previous  dental  office.  There  is  a  different  stimulus  and  response.  This  learned  difference  is  called discrimination. In each case the child visits a dentist, but dentists' cues are different, eliciting different responses.\nAfter retraining children, many  clinicians develop long-term, close relationships with them."

    "context_enriched_content": "summary\nThis chapter has dealt with a broad spectrum of nonpharmacologic methods of behavior management. It has described techniques which have evolved in dentistry and  has  related  them  to  psychology,  a  science  which deals with human behavior. Thus, it has tried to provide an interdisciplinary approach.\nThere  are  laws  which  govern  human  behavior  and concepts  that  govern  learning.  Programs  most  closely following a model will be the most efficient in terms of learning. Those which deviate from the models will be less efficient, with the loss of efficiency directly related to the amount of deviation from the model. With the understanding of such learning principles, pediatric dentistry management becomes more effective. An understanding of these laws cannot help having a positive influence on the daily practice of dentistry and on the lines of communication within the pediatric dentistry treatment triangle. Behavior  management  is  studied  by  pediatric  dentists in some depth. Many general dentists and other dental personnel  often  receive  a  cursory  introduction  to  the subject.  Hopefully,  the  writing  of  this  book  will  help increase general knowledge.\nThe  chapter  was  divided  into  five  parts:  getting  to know your patient, pre-appointment behavior modification,  effective  communication,  non-pharmacologic clinical  strategies,  and  retraining.  In  some  instances, methods  such  as  voice  control  and  modeling  overlap and were touched upon in more than one part. This was pointed out in the text. In many instances, the referencing was historical. That is the way it is nowadays. Wilson and  Cody  (2005)  searched  the  literature  on  behavior management, excluding  sedation  articles.  They  found that only 168 articles were  published in Pediatric Dentistry and the Journal of Dentistry for Children over a thirty-year  period.  The  number  of  articles  involving clinical studies was less than a third of the total number of articles, 38% were opinion papers, and 32% were surveys  or  descriptions  of  behavior  management  in  the dental setting. Wilson and Cody concluded that the evidence-based data to support the effectiveness of behavior management techniques in pediatric dentistry is limited and needs further development. The authors of  this  chapter  are  in  agreement  with  the  conclusion. Averaging  less  than  two  clinical  studies  on  behavior management per year over a thirty-year period is regrettable. If the management of children in the dental environment is one of the keys to the specialty of pediatric dentistry, then more research is needed."

    "context_enriched_content": "introduction\nDisabilities affect many people today. Prevalence varies between different countries and cultures, but it is realistic to assume that up to twenty percent of all children and  adolescents  may  be  affected  by  a  disability  or  a chronic  health  condition  (Merrick  and  Carmeli  2003; Bethell et al. 2008). Further, the number of individuals with disabilities is increasing owing to developments in medical  health  technology,  diagnostic  tools,  and  an increase  in  the  number  of  medical  treatment  options. For example, more children who have been born preterm survive because of improvements in medical care, but  these  children  also  have  an  increased  risk  for disabilities.\nThis chapter will discuss special child patients with disabilities  or  chronic  health  conditions  and  provide examples to assist with their management in the dental office. It will also focus on how the dental team can work together  with  the  child  and  family  to  create  positive dental appointments and good oral health. As with all child dental patients, caring for the special child involves the pediatric dentistry treatment triangle-the child, the parent  or  legal  guardian,  and  the  dental  team.  This chapter  will  provide  details  about  each  corner  of  the triangle. For dental care and treatment to be successful, all three components of the triangle have to collaborate and communicate. Ultimately, the dentist is responsible for the treatment and should acquire appropriate knowledge about the child's diagnosis or disability, as well as an understanding of the psychology of the family.\nBefore discussing the corners of the triangle, mention must be made of two important international declarations that have direct bearing on special children. The first is the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations  1989),  which  was  ratified  by  a  majority  of nations worldwide. The overriding point in the\nConvention  is  that  children  have  rights. According  to the third article in the Convention, the 'best interest' of the  child  should  be  the  guiding  rule  in  all  decisions involving or affecting children. The Convention has had a significant impact (e.g., The Child Friendly Healthcare Initiative)  on  the  way  all  children  are  treated  and respected  within  the  health  sector.  Children  have  the right to be involved in decisions about treatment, and their points of view should be respected, taking age and maturity into consideration.\nThe  second  declaration  occurred  in  2006  when  the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Its purpose was 'to promote, protect  and  ensure  the  full  and  equal  enjoyment  of  all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.' The Convention noted changing societal views on people with disabilities. Historically, individuals with disabilities have been seen as objects rather than subjects. In the past, society provided help and support for people with disabilities in terms of benevolence and charity. This is  no  longer  an  acceptable  attitude.  The  Convention strengthened the position of people with disabilities. It stressed  that  people  with  disabilities  are  subjects  and individuals  like  everyone  else,  and  thereby  have  the same  rights  for  making  decisions  that  influence  their lives,  including  health-related  matters.  Dental  professionals treating children need to be aware of these societal  changes  in  attitude  and  apply  these  principles  in their practices.\nAs this chapter deals with children with disabilities, it is  important  to  define  '  disability.'  Today,  disabilities and  chronic  conditions  are  not  only  looked  upon  as diagnoses defined in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The understanding and classification of disability and chronic health conditions is also based on a  bio-psychosocial  model,  as  articulated  in  the  World"

    "context_enriched_content": "introduction\nHealth  Organization's  International  Classification  of Functioning and Health (ICF), adopted in 2001, and in the Child and Youth Version, ICF-CY, for individuals up to the age of seventeen, adopted in 2007. The ICF as a model describes  human  functioning  in  terms  of  body structure,  body  function,  activities  and  participation. These  functions  are  influenced  by  health  condition, environmental factors, and personal factors. Today, the ICF-CY  as  a  classification  comprises  more  than  1600 items related to body structure, body function, activities and  participation, and  environmental  factors. It is universal,  it  allows  comparisons  of  health  conditions with different etiologies, and it can describe a person's health profile from a bio-psychosocial perspective. This perspective holds interest from a dental standpoint, and studies  are  currently  being  undertaken  to  construct  a core set in oral health (Faulks et al. 2013). The ICF and ICF-CY provide a new way of understanding the continuum normal → disability.  It  focuses  on  the  individual's overall health status instead of focusing only on the specific disability or impairment. By doing so, it becomes evident  that  anyone  can  experience  a  health  problem, and thereby a disability."

    "context_enriched_content": "the special Child\nEvery  child  is  a  unique  individual.  This  is  true  for healthy children with normal development and maturation,  even  more  so  for  children  with  disabilities  or chronic  health  conditions.  Children  and  adolescents show great variation in maturity, personality, temperament, and emotions. Additionally, cognitive reasoning, behavioral repertoires, and communicative skills vary, especially in children with disabilities. This leads to a corresponding variation in vulnerability and ability to cope with dental treatment.\nThe disabled child patient can be special in many different ways. This chapter focuses on children with special needs owing to disability or chronic health conditions, but it is important to acknowledge that there are other reasons  for  being  special.  For  example,  children  may have  language  difficulties  because  they  migrated  to  a new  country,  or  simply  because  they  are  part  of  an immigrant  family  that  communicates  mostly  in  their native  language.  Communication  is  essential  and  the basis of successful treatment, and if the child or parent does not speak your language, interpretation might be required. Children who live in deprived socio-economic settings or who have parents with mental or psychiatric illness  are  other  examples  that  may  require  special attention from the dentist. And, it must be remembered that not all children develop and mature at the same rate. These children may not necessarily have impairments, but  they  are  late  bloomers  and  communication  and treatment may have to be adjusted to their level of maturity  rather  than  to  their  chronological  age.  This  last example  also  demonstrates  why  dentists,  especially pediatric  dentists,  should  have  knowledge  of  child development  (see  Chapter  Two).  Development  and maturation  also  vary  in  children  with  disabilities  and medical conditions on an individual basis, and can be affected  by  a  poor  socio-economic  environment  or parental illness.\nThe best way to learn about a child's capabilities is to ask. A thorough case history is a must, and ideally both the  child  and  the  parents  should  be  interviewed.  The routine anamnesis for the healthy child should include information about medical diagnoses, medication, family  and  social  contexts,  school,  and  peer-related issues. However, for the special child patient, the interview  needs  to  be  more  detailed  and  include  specific areas related to the child's condition.\nWhen obtaining a medical history, specifically inquire about the perinatal period and birth. The importance of these developmental periods was emphasized in Chapter  Two.  Low  birth  weight  or  complications  like defective  saturation  or  infections  can  affect  nutrition, growth,  and  development.  There  are  several  developmental windows through which all children pass. These windows  are  open  for  a  limited  period  of  time,  and passing through one window, or level, in development provides children with the requirements needed to manage the next level. For example, children born preterm often have difficulties coordinating sucking, swallowing or breathing, which also may be affected by their medical  health  status  (Delaney  et  al.  2008).  Furthermore, children who have problems in breast feeding or sucking as newborns may have an increased risk of developing feeding  problems.  The  developmental  train  typically forecasts  that  average  children  learn  to  manage  fluids and to swallow at an early age (Mason et al. 2005). Based on these skills, children will be able to consume more complex food textures, tastes, and temperatures as they mature  and  their  feeding  progresses  to  include  new types of foods. Successful managing and swallowing of the bolus has to be preceded by training and handling of other  kinds  of  foods  and  liquids.  Some  children  with feeding  problems,  owing  to  prematurity  or  medical problems,  develop  hyper-sensitivity  in  the  orofacial region,  which,  if  untreated,  could  make  it  difficult  to carry out oral hygiene procedures like tooth brushing, or  even  to  conduct  dental  examinations  (Mason  et  al. 2005; Rommel et al. 2003).\nThe perinatal period is also important for tooth mineralization. Hypomineralization and hypoplasia in enamel have been reported as more common in children born preterm; molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH)"

    "context_enriched_content": "the special Child\noccurs more frequently in these children. Further, it is probable  that  dental  behavior  management  problems and dental anxiety are more likely for children born preterm than for others (Brogårdh-Roth 2010).\nThe medical history should cover all medical issues. Information about periods of hospitalization, medications, and physicians responsible for the child's medical care can become detailed and complex. There are several medical diagnoses and medicines that may impact oral health. The dentist is advised to look up both diagnoses and medications in order to find out if there are any  direct  implications  or  interactions  in  relation  to dental care. There are also several rare diagnoses and syndromes  that  the  pediatric  dentist  may  encounter. Apart from textbooks, there are several good databases available via the Internet to learn more about general aspects  of  the  diagnoses;  for  example,  Orphanet  and National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities.  Another  useful  website  disomic ( Online Mendelian  Inheritance  in  Man)  section  that  can  be accessed via PubMed. Some countries also have national centers that specialize in the orofacial and odontological  aspects  of  rare  diagnoses.  One  example  is  the National Resource Centre for Rare Disorders in Sweden (Mun-H-Center), which provides a website and a smartphone app in English.\nOther important case history aspects include information about the child's normal life and his strengths and weaknesses.  For  children  with  disabilities  or  medical  health problems, much time is spent discussing the child's problems  and  weaknesses.  It  is  equally  important  to  learn about the child's strengths.\nKnowledge about the strengths of the child is often useful  when  trying  to  individualize  the  appointment. For example, a child might have problems with sudden or loud noises and is easily frightened, but at the same time could be interested in music and may enjoy specific types of music. This information may be important and useful for the dentist. For example, instead of avoiding noise  and  being  concerned  about  how  the  child  will react  to  the  sound  of  suction,  the  dentist  could  play music during the treatment or explain the treatment and sounds  that  will  occur  in  terms  of  music.  Some  may think this is farfetched, but when working with a special child patient it is often necessary to step out of the more traditional role of the dentist. Being successful with special  children  implies  being  open  to  trying  new  things and being a bit unconventional in the choice of methods from time to time.\nIt  is  not  always  optimal  for  children  to  be  present while parents and health care professionals discuss their problems and limitations. One might try to circumvent the problem by either scheduling a parent appointment without  the  child  or  arranging  a  telephone  interview.\nApart from not exposing the child to negative information, gaining information in advance from the parents makes it possible for the dentist to be better prepared  when  meeting  the  special  child  patient  for  the first  time.  By  gathering  vital  information  beforehand, the dentist can fully focus on the child and the interactions  at the first visit instead of having to start with the anamnesis."

    "context_enriched_content": "the family\nParents and family constitute the second component of the pediatric dental triangle. Being a parent of a special child is, in many ways, different from being a parent of a  healthy  child.  Living  with  a  child  with  a  disability affects all aspects of family life. It is known to be a powerful stressor for all family members, although several studies have shown that mothers experience more stress and often take more responsibility for the child with a disability or chronic health condition than the rest of the family (Cairns 1992). The concerns and worries can be life-long. They differ from the more normal worries that all  parents have about their children as they grow up. Being a parent of an adult child with a disability will bring  concerns  about  where  the  child  should  live, receive  adequate  help  and  assistance,  and  what  will happen when the parents are no longer around (Hallberg et al. 2010).\nThe family's level of self-reliance (capacity) or reconciliation with having a child with a disability influences how they cope with the child's medical and dental care, and  how  they  will  manage  parenting.  It  is  important that the family balances its subjective feelings of vulnerability and access to support from others. This perspective,  emphasizing  the  need  for  support,  has  been reported to increase psychological and physical well-being in families who have a child with a disability (Scheeran et al. 1997). Apart from support from significant  others  such  as  relatives  and  friends,  it  is important  for  families  to  have  support  and  positive responses  from  professionals  within  the  social  sector and health care professions, including dentistry.\nParents  and  families  who  are  self-reliant  and  who have  become  reconciled  to  their situation tend  to develop  feelings of confidence in caring for their children. This can gradually lead to their perception of a less  stressful  and  more  manageable  situation.  It  will probably  affect  how  they  cope  with  their  children's needs  in  relation  to  medical  and  dental  treatment, including preventive home care. As prevention of oral diseases  requires  establishing  good  rapport  with  the families,  the  dental  teams  need  to  have  good  knowledge  and  insight  into  the  lives  of  those  who  have\ndisabilities. In order to achieve this balance, it is important not only to treat the child, but also to consider the whole family (Trulsson and Klingberg 2003).\nIn a study by Trulsson and Klingberg (2003), parents of  children  with  severe  and  complex  diagnoses  were interviewed about issues related to their children's oral health and dental care. The parents identified five qualities  they  would  like  to  see  in  dental  teams:  respect, involvement,  continuity,  knowledge,  and  availability. These  five  qualities  might  be  regarded  as  a  matter  of course,  but  apparently  these  needs  had  not  been  met. Another interesting finding from the interviews concerned the way that the parents described their children's  main  orofacial  or  oral  heath-related  problems. According to the participating parents, the main problems were related to nutrition and communication. They also mentioned dental malocclusions, but only in relation to the possibility of improving chewing and speech or decreasing the risk of dental trauma, but not in relation  to  esthetics.  No  other  oral  health  issues,  such  as dental caries and gingivitis, were mentioned by the parents. One could argue that this study dealt with children with  very  complex  diagnoses,  but  nonetheless,  it  is apparent that the parents' and dentists' views on what is most important may differ."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Dental team\nPeople with disabilities may be subject to inequality in oral health, in terms of both prevalence of disease and unmet healthcare needs. While most pediatric dentists have training  with  special  child  patients,  provision  of large-scale  primary  care  is  only  possible  through  the education  and  training  of  all  dentists.  The  literature suggests that it is vital for the dental team to develop the  necessary  skills  and  gain  experience  treating  people with special needs in order to ensure access to oral health care for all persons (Faulks et al. 2012).\nThe  dental  treatment  for  children  with  disabilities varies greatly. There are many reasons for this, and some of importance are related to the individual dentist and dental team. Studies have pointed to the fact that many dentists  and  other  members  of  the  dental  team  feel  a professional  uncertainty  in  treating  individuals  with disabilities (Bedi et al. 2001; Hallberg et al. 2003). Reasons offered for this attitude include the fact that many dentists lack previous knowledge and experience in treating patients  with  disabilities,  and  there  is  little  relevant training  in  either  undergraduate  or  postgraduate  programs (Kinne and Steifel 1979; Bedi et al. 1986; Bedi et al. 1989). This is troublesome, as the ambivalent attitudes from  dental  professionals  towards  these  patients  may contribute  to  less  treatment  offered  to  these  patient groups (O'Donnell 1993; Bedi et al. 2001; Klingberg and Hallberg 2012). Being successful in the dental treatment of special child patients, therefore, depends in large part on  the  dental  team,  and  specifically  on  the  dentist himself.\nAnother reason for varying treatment is the economic standard in families. Depending on how dental care and social  insurance  systems  are  organized  in  the  country, this will impact dental care for children with disabilities and, in the long-term, the oral health of these children. If pharmacological means are required to treat the patient, it  can be quite costly. The special child patient offers a positive challenge for the dentist and an opportunity to progress and learn more within the profession. Managing and treating the special child patient successfully, and having the child return with a smile on his face, yields immense professional satisfaction. That is what makes working with special child patients so special.\nThe  remainder  of  this  chapter  deals  with  specific disabilities. It will offer some helpful hints for the   dentist and the dental team."

    "context_enriched_content": "Physical impairments\nPhysical impairments constitute a wide group of diagnoses  with  some  having  a  substantial  impact  on  the child's daily life in terms of reduced motor ability. The clinical manifestations vary widely from quadriplegia to conditions affecting the function of a limb or part of a limb. Some of the physical disabilities may be present at birth, while others may be acquired as a result of trauma or disease. A common diagnosis in this group is cerebral palsy,  with  four  main  subtypes:  spastic  (muscle  stiffness), atheotid (slow movements), ataxic (lack of muscular balance and coordination) and mixed (having symptoms of more than one type of cerebral palsy, the most common being spastic-dyskinetic). Other common diagnoses  are  muscular  dystrophies  and  spina  bifida. For  all  diagnoses  that  lead  to  a  decrease  in  physical activity, especially if the muscle tone is altered, there is a risk that body posture will impact the oral cavity both in terms of growth patterns and oral health. A hypotonic patient sitting in a position where the head is not supported will have an increased risk of developing malocclusions  because  the  muscular  forces  that  normally regulate the growth are affected. The tone is too low in the tongue, cheeks, and related structures. The same is true  for  the  opposite  condition-hypertonic  patients. Patients with spastic problems sometimes present with self-inflicted injuries or bite wounds. These patients can be hard to treat, and the dentist may have to use a bite support or mouth prop to prevent the child patient from involuntary biting during treatment."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nHigh quality treatment and good patient management is facilitated if the patient is seated in the dental chair and able to relax. Some patients may have problems moving from their wheelchair to the dental chair. However, the patient  should  be  moved  onto  the  dental  chair  whenever possible, despite the difficulties that this may entail. To  reduce  the  amount  of  chair  movement,  which  can heighten a patient's anxiety, some prefer to pre-set the chair  in  the  approximate  position  before  seating  the patient. Having the child in the dental chair improves the ergonomic  position  for the dentist, facilitating treatment and thereby improving quality in dental care. A  dental  clinic  has  to  be  designed  to  accommodate wheelchairs. (Some ideas for these accommodations can be found in Chapter Seventeen). In many clinics dedicated to the treatment of the special child, sliding equipment and lift systems are available to move the patient to the dental chair.\nTo make the dental chair more comfortable for patients, different kinds of cushions may be used. A cushion to sit on is very useful for most of the younger patients, as the normal dental chair is designed for an adult's full body length (See Figure 7-1). There are also special cushions available  that  will  support  the  body  for  patients  with low muscle tone or spasticities. These cushions provide a  passive  support  and  should  not  be  confused  with restraint.  Light  Velcro  is  used  to  keep  the  cushions  in position. For patients with spastic problems, the cushions  are  adjusted  to  help  flexing  knees  and  hip  joints (ideally  to  a  ninety-degree  flexion)  and  to  incline  the head to a chin-to-chest position. This position can help to reduce spasticities, which in turn makes it easier for\nFigure  7-1. Special  cushions  to  support  the  body  for  patients  with  low muscle tone or spasticities. For patients with spastic problems, the cushions are adjusted to help flexing knees and hip joints (ideally to a ninety-degree flexion) and to incline the head to a chin-to chest-position.\nthe child to relax. These cushions can also be used for patients with intellectual disabilities or neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients without disabilities may also benefit from the comfort of cushions.\nSome children with dysphagia may have an increased risk of aspiration. Therefore, it is highly important for the dental team to be alert and ready to provide good assistance to remove secretions and dental debris during treatment. For some children, the problems are so severe that all dental treatment will need to be carried out under general anesthesia.\nSedation  often  helps  to  reduce  anxiety  and  assist  a child with disability to relax during treatment. Minimum sedation is often sufficient; however, all types of sedation and dosages have to be tailored to the individual child. Nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation should not be used unless the child is able to nose breathe. Apart from being ineffective  if  not  inhaled,  exposure  to  nitrous  oxide should be avoided for work environmental reasons. An ASA  (American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists)  physical status  evaluation  is  extremely  important  for  children with  disabilities,  and  the  child's  physician  should  be consulted  if  any  questions  arise.  For  some  children, dental treatment cannot be carried out conventionally or under  sedation-treatment  under  general  anesthesia may  be  the  only  alternative.  Access  to  facilities  for general  anesthesia  varies  between  different  countries; however, it is important to strive for these resources for this group of children. Not having this option may lead to  either  suboptimal  dental  care  and  deteriorated  oral health,  or  no  treatment  at  all.  From  that  perspective, access to general anesthesia is a communal obligation if society wants to ensure these children's right to receive oral health care on the same level as others."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nEditors' Note: By cradling a child's head against the operator's  body,  satisfactory  stabilization  can  often  be obtained. Using a rubber dam imparts a feeling of security that may be helpful for managing these children. At times,  bite  blocks  may  be  used  in  the  mouth. A  body wrap may be used to help restrain movements, or sometimes a simple strap over a child's ankles may assist with stabilization. This additional armamentarium serves the purposes of protecting the child, facilitating dental procedures, and providing security. In the development of this chapter, it was recognized that there were regional differences. In Sweden and some other European countries, physical restraints are not culturally accepted and are prohibited by law under any circumstance. It should be emphasized that clinicians in these countries are able to treat patients successfully with extra time devoted to working with the parent and child and without the use of restraints. However, in other countries, some forms of restraints are still used and intended as a benefit to the consenting patient and/or parent.\nAnother form of physical impairment is obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has categorized obesity as an epidemic  with  physical, psychological,  and  social  consequences  in  adults  and children (CDC 2009). The prevalence of overweight and obesity  is  rising  in  many  developed  and  developing countries and, most worryingly, among children. Currently, 32% of children and adolescents in the United States  are  overweight  or  obese  (Ogden  et  al.  2010).  In England,  almost  a  quarter  of  children  now  enter  primary school either overweight or obese, rising to one in three by age eleven. Available data for all other countries indicates a rising trend.\nThe  rise  of  obesity  within  populations  can  have  an impact on dental professionals. Problems extend from the effect of obesity directly on dental disease, to medical conditions influencing the development and treatment of dental disease, to the practicality of treating the obese in a conventional dental primary care setting (Reilly  et  al.  2009).  Although  the  speed  of  the  obesity epidemic has been greater than the recognition of the impending crisis by healthcare services (Levine 2012), many hospitals and dental clinics  in  developed  countries  now  recognize  the  need  for  bariatric  equipment such as beds, hoists, wheelchairs and commodes to take patients weighing more than 350 kg.\nMany obese children come from families with lower socio-economic standards. There are several factors that contribute to overweight and obesity: bad dietary habits, high consumption of fast foods, sucrose-rich beverages, refined wheat bread, little or no physical activity, as well as some genetic influence. Even though dental caries are not always seen in overweight or obese young children, the risk for both caries and gingival inflammation will increase if the weight is not treated.  Overweight and   obesity affect the ASA evaluation of the patient, and the dentist should be aware of the effect of adiposity on the  distribution,  binding,  and  elimination  of  many commonly used drugs in dentistry. Obesity may complicate  the  use  of  pharmacological  methods  of  patient management,  and  adverse  events  during  sedation  for dental procedures have been reported (Kang et al. 2012). There could be increased risk of respiratory depression when  Midazolam  or  opioids  such  as  meperidine  are administered(Kang et al. 2012). Obese children also have a higher incidence of difficult mask ventilation, laryngoscopy,  aspiration,  postoperative  atelectasis,  airway obstruction, bronchospasm, major oxygen desaturation, and overall critical respiratory events (Tait et al. 2008).\nBesides  attending  to  the  obese  child's  dental  needs, dentists who care for children are in a unique position to help address the childhood obesity epidemic for several reasons (Tseng et al. 2010). First, dentists may see children regularly, providing an opportunity for longitudinal counseling and  monitoring  of weight  status often starting at an early age. Second, dentists have a greater likelihood than pediatricians of seeing older children on a regular basis. Third, dentists are credible sources for dietary counseling. Most dentists who treat children feel that  dietary  counseling  is  an  important  component  of oral health."

However,  showing  empathy  and  tact  will enable the dentist to raise the issue and discover whether the child has had any medical weight counseling. If not, the  dentist  should  help  to  refer  the  child  for  medical evaluation. As treatment for obesity and overweight is composed of several different methods that are individually tailored and decided on after careful medical evaluation,  the  dentist  should  limit  advice  to  oral  health matters."

    "context_enriched_content": "intellectual Disability\nAccording to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) (former American Association on Mental Retardation) 'intellectual  disability'  is  currently  the  preferred  term  for  the disability that previously has been referred to as mental retardation. This change in terminology is also present in  the  new  DSM-5  manual  published  in  May  2013 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). Intellectual disability is, by the definition from AAIDD, 'characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills. This  disability  originates  before  age  18.'  Historically, individuals  with  an  intelligence  quotient  (IQ)  under seventy  were  considered  as  having  an  intellectual disability.  However,  current  definitions  include  both mental functioning and functioning skills in the individual's environment. As a result, a person with a belowaverage intelligence quotient may not be considered as having an intellectual disability unless they exhibit deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors. Still, the IQ test is  a  major  tool  for  measuring  intellectual  functioning, and according to DSM-5, intellectual disability is considered  to  be  approximately  two  standard  deviations  or more below the population, which equals an IQ score of  about  seventy  or  below.  An  IQ  between  fifty  and sixty-nine denotes a mild or educable condition, while an IQ under fifty denotes severe intellectual disability. Approximately 3% of the population is affected by intellectual disability and 0.6% are affected to a severe degree.\nThere are many causes of intellectual disability. The most  common  causes  include  genetic  deficits  (e.g., Down syndrome), perinatal insults (oxygen deficiency before, during, or after birth), infections (such as rubella or meningitis) or trauma affecting the brain.\nSince there are different levels of intellectual disability, the symptoms and manifestations vary widely between individuals.  Generally,  children  with  intellectual  disabilities  are  slower  in  acquiring  self-care  life-skills, have difficulty remembering things, and have delayed language development. There are children with milder forms  of  intellectual  disability  that  need  very  little support, and who often become excellent dental patients. At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  there  are  children with severe or profound disabilities who need twentyfour-hour  assistance  for  all  situations.  These  children frequently  require  general  anesthesia  or  sedation  for their  dental  care.  Comorbidity  is  common  in  patients with intellectual disability. Many children with intellectual disability have additional health problems, such as other physical impairments, epilepsy, neuropsychiatric problems, and congenital heart defects or syndromes."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nAs for all children, the creation of a safe environment for the child patient with an intellectual disability is fundamental for successful dental visits. In order for the child to feel safe, at least three factors have to be fulfilled: 1) a good rapport and relationship between the child, the accompanying person, and the dentist, 2)   minimizing the risk  of  pain  during  treatment,  and  3)  helping  the  child develop a feeling of control. Stepwise introduction using tell-show-do (TSD), sometimes with the help of pedagogic tools  like  photos  or  pictures  (see  Austism  Spectrum Disorder), should be performed at a slow pace. The dentist should impart a feeling of control to the patient so that the child knows what is going to happen and feels convinced that the dentist will react or stop if the child signals.\nDue to diminished intellectual growth, many children with  intellectual disability function with  a limited capacity  in  comparison  to  other  children.  Hence,  the social  functioning  of  these  children  is  found  to  be affected,  and  this  is  closely  related  to  their  degree  of impairment. Children and adolescents with intellectual disability  need  time  to  feel  comfortable  in  the  dental setting,  and  time  has  to  be  invested  in  these  patients. These  children  also  benefit  from  meeting  the  same dental team during visits. If this is provided, the dental visits  and  simple  treatments  are  usually  accepted  by children with intellectual disability. However, all treatments have to be constantly tailored to the individual patient's capacities and needs. For example, an injection can provoke fear for a child with an intellectual disability, just as it can with any other child, and the numbness following  the  injection  sometimes  elicits  strong  negative reactions. The child with intellectual disability that does not  understand  why this  feeling  occurs  or  that  it  will eventually disappear. Complications such as biting of an anesthetized lip or cheek can occur; the use of periodontal ligament injections when possible may help prevent this common problem.\nMany children with intellectual  disability  will  need help from others to carry out basic procedures like tooth brushing, due to their limited or decreased manual dexterity and/or lack of motivation and understanding of the  importance  of  good  oral  hygiene.  This  need  for assistance often stretches into adulthood."

    "context_enriched_content": "sensory impairments\nThis  section  deals  with  children  possessing  varying degrees of auditory and visual impairments. Deficiencies in these senses interfere with communication and may lead to difficulties in patient treatment.\nHearing impairment and deafness occurs in children, although  it  is  much  more  common  in  adults  and  the elderly. There are both congenital and acquired forms, and the level of impairment can vary from mild to total deafness.  It  should  be  noted  that  hearing  impairment has comorbidity with other conditions, like intellectual disability, as well as some syndromes. Children who are hard  of  hearing  will  find  it  much  more  difficult  than children who have normal hearing to learn vocabulary, grammar,  word  order,  idiomatic  expressions,  and  other aspects  of  verbal  communication  (National  Information Centre  for  Children  and  Youth  with  Disabilities  2004). These deficiencies can affect communication and treatment in dental care. Interpretation using sign language might be necessary and should be offered if available. If not, the dental team should ensure that the appointment is scheduled in a way that allows for extra time. Parents can  also  be  of  major  assistance  in  interpreting  procedures  for  their  child.  They  should  be  invited  into  the operatory because it may be difficult to explain concepts such as local anesthesia to the deaf child.\nProblems related to hearing will affect communication during dental treatment. Ideally, the dentist should know  how  to  communicate  with  sign  language.  If this  is  not  the  case,  it  is  still  possible  to  learn  a  few signs that can be helpful during treatment. For example,  signs  for  'open  your  mouth,'  'good  boy/ good girl', and 'toothbrush,' plus social expressions like  'welcome,'  'good-bye,'  etc.  are  beneficial.  Sign language  is  not  a  universal  language,  and  different verbal  language  areas  and  cultural  regions  can  have different signs. Usually, older children who cognitively\nunderstand dental treatment can be very good patients. But the dental team has to invest in time and in introduction to accomplish this. Consider the classic behavior-shaping  TSD  technique.  Verbal  communication  is an  integral  part  of  the  procedure,  and  so  the  deaf child must be managed differently. In fact, almost all of the  communication  techniques  that  are  described  for the average child cannot be used with the deaf child. For  example,  as  many  children  with  hearing  impairments  or  deafness  can  use  lip  reading,  the  dentist should perhaps avoid wearing a mask during treatment (Champion and Holt 2000).\nThe use of sedation can be helpful for some children with  hearing  impairments.  If  the  child  with  deafness needs  extensive  dental  care,  this  should  preferably  be carried out under  general  anesthesia,  especially in younger children. New technology has enabled treatment of deafness-especially congenital forms-by cochlear implants. If the child patient is using a hearing aid  device  or  has  a  cochlear  implant,  it  is  sometimes necessary to adjust the head cushion to find a comfortable position for the child during treatment. Sometimes the hearing device has to be disconnected if it doesn't function  with  the  noise  during  treatment,  resulting  in more difficulties concerning communication.\nThe deaf child also partially compensates for hearing loss by use of hearing aids, or manual communication (signs, finger spelling). However, too often these acquired  skills  are  not  learned  until  a  child  is  six  or seven years of age, a time when children with normal hearing  are  learning  to  read  and  write.  Nonetheless, with  gifted  children  and  dedicated  teachers,  who  frequently  are  the  parents,  it  is  often  possible  to  acquire visual  communication  skills  as  early  as  three  or  four years of age."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nSince  normal  verbalization  is  impossible  with  many deaf  children,  substitute  communication  procedures must be used to convey information. The following tips are helpful to communicate with the hearing impaired (Nunn, J.H. 2000):\n- Remove masks when communicating with the child and reduce background noise.\n- Learn a few basic signs.\n- Write essential information on a 'magic slate,' use picture books to explain things.\n- Be sure to face the child when communicating and ensure  that  the  light  is  not  behind  you  or  in  the child's eyes.\n- Use texting, Typetalk or some  other of form electronic communication that children use today.\nMany  procedures  have  been  recommended  for  establishing rapport and communication  with  children. Although the dentist may not employ all these procedures for the average child, they are highly important in the  behavior  management  of  the  deaf  child.  When tipping the dental chair back, for example, the operator should make sure the child knows beforehand what will happen and then maybe touch the patient to impart a feeling of security. A hand mirror is an invaluable aid during most procedures, but the tactile sense also should be used. Children should be allowed to touch the instruments. This is used to great advantage with the average child; it must be used to the maximum for the deaf child. Use  desensitization  to  introduce  new  instruments  or equipment. For example, when compressed air is used, it  should  be  demonstrated  on  the  operator's  cheek  or hand, and then on the patient's hand, before it is introduced intra-orally. Since these children learn by touching,  they  should  be  allowed  as  much  freedom  as  the office environment permits. This does not mean being overly  permissive;  rather,  it  is  intended  to  allow  deaf children to acclimate to the environment. Children have an insatiable curiosity with the gadgetry in the dental office. The deaf child is no exception.\nVisually impaired children also present communication problems. Childhood blindness, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to a group of diseases and conditions occurring in childhood or early adolescence  which,  if  left  untreated,  result  in  blindness  or severe visual impairment. The estimated prevalence of blindness in children varies from 0.3/1,000 in wealthy countries to 1.2/1,000 in poorer countries (Gilbert 2001).\nBlindness can be found in conjunction with other conditions,  such  as  deafness  or  intellectual  disability.  As with other conditions, evaluation of the child's intellectual  capacity  and  a  clear  understanding  of  intrinsic limitations  is  extremely  important  before  approaching the  patient.  When  intellectual  disability  or  deafness  is found  in  conjunction  with  blindness,  even  the  most primitive  communication with the afflicted  child  may be difficult and unproductive. In these instances, referral to a specialist with broad experience with children having disabilities is advisable.\nLike  many  other  conditions,  blindness  occurs  in varying  degrees  and  in  specific  circumstances.  Some children may have partial sight. Others may have had normal sight and then lost it. When this occurs after five years of age, children may retain a visual frame of reference.  However,  without  minimal  visual  experiences, these  children  out  of  necessity  become  highly  verbal. Through verbalization, they try to identify objects and understand everyday happenings.\nThere  are  four  levels  of  visual  function,  according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th\nRevision  (2010).  These  are:  normal  vision,  moderate visual impairment, severe visual impairment and blindness. Moderate visual impairment combined with severe visual impairment are grouped under the term 'low vision', and together with blindness represents all visual impairment. The dentist should always check with the parents as to the level of the child's impairment."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nSince the 'show' portion of behavior shaping (TSD) is greatly limited or impossible with visually impaired or blind children, the other aspects of education and conditioning in dental office procedures must be stressed. These children compensate for the lack of visual input by increased use of the auditory, tactile, and olfactory senses.  Therefore,  new  procedures  must  be  carefully explained, maximizing sensory perceptions other than sight. All new sounds and smells should be identified. The children should be allowed to feel new objects, and these objects should be named whenever possible. By the process of exploring with their fingers, blind children develop a great tactile sensitivity. They also tend to be  rather  passive  and  inactive  because  movement  is obviously more hazardous and requires more effort for them.  They  require  more  stimulation  to  venture  into unknown  experiences.  Thus,  the  show  technique  is accomplished for the blind child with more effort from the dental team in a manner that is different from that used for the sighted child.\nRecently, a new technique was developed for training visually impaired children in oral hygiene maintenance (Hebbal and Ankola 2012). Working with ninety-six children six to eighteen years of age at a school for the blind in India, researchers developed the Audiovisual Tactile Performance  technique  (ATP).  This  special  education technique follows a pattern: children are informed about the importance of teeth and a brushing method; children then feel teeth on a model and brush the model; once mastered, the children feel and brush their own teeth. The study demonstrated that visually impaired children could maintain an acceptable level of oral hygiene when taught  using  a  special  customized  method.  It  is  often difficult to treat blind children and extensive treatment may require sedation and/or general anesthesia. Therefore, the focus should be on disease prevention."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nThe  literature  reports  no  differences  in  prevalence  of caries between children with ASD and others, providing there is no other underlying medical condition. A probable reason for this is that families or caregivers are able to provide a good diet for the child, with a low intake of cariogenic items. However, there are reports of more  plaque  and  gingivitis  compared  with  dental records  of  healthy  children.  The  reason  may  again  be related to families or caregivers, as many children and adolescents  with  ASD  are  dependent  on  help  from others  to  carry  out  oral  hygiene  procedures.  Brushing the teeth of children and adolescents with ASD is often difficult.\nIf  the  dental  team  knows  beforehand  that  the  child has been diagnosed with ASD, it is advisable to discuss the case history and treatment with the parents before the first visit. This could be achieved by either contacting  the  family  by  phone  or  scheduling  a  separate appointment with the parents alone. One advantage of having  the  parents  visit  the  clinic  before  the  child's appointment is that they might feel more comfortable when they bring their child-they easily find their way, know  where  to  park,  and  already  know  the  dentist.\nAdditionally, parental input may be more important for ASD child patients than for average children.\nInterviews with parents should focus on the child's strengths, what the child likes, appropriate rewards, and whether or not the child speaks and if not, the best way to communicate. It is also important to find out about the child's fears, particularly things like noise or a strong light.  Children  with ASD  are  often  overly  sensitive  to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights. In the dental treatment situation,  children with ASD need help to understand and focus on the treatment. Many children feel comfortable  with  established  rituals,  which  can  be  used  for treatment.  It  is  important  for  the  patient  to  meet  the same dentist and preferably the same assistant or dental hygienist  in  order  to  get  to  know  the  personnel  and learn  to  trust  them.  Several  appointments  are  often necessary for an introduction to dental care. As for most patients  with  neuropsychiatric  disorder,  children  with ASD need help to both understand and to focus on the treatment  situation.  Reducing  incoming  visual  and auditory stimuli is often helpful. This will be discussed further  when  describing  the  management  of  patients with ADHD.\nAs  many  children  with  ASD  have  difficulty  with abstract reasoning, the communication should be modified to suit the individual patient. Use concrete language and  eliminate  abstract  concepts.  Many  children  with ASD are quite literal and often misunderstand abstract sayings  like  'it's  raining  cats  and  dogs'  or  'take  my hand.' It is wise to be clear and objective in communication. Just tell the child what you want to achieve, give simple directions, and skip the small talk. Avoid detailed explanations and nonverbal cues-the child will often be happier with very concrete information. For example, you fix a tooth because it is broken. The reason behind the cavity is not important.\nThe introduction to examination or treatment may be carried  out  over  a  number  of  appointments  spaced one  or  a  few  days  apart.  Alternatively,  several  short appointments  sequentially  on  the  same  day  may  be used. A stepwise introduction to gradually more stressprovoking items  and  parts  of  a  normal  dental  visit  is carried  out.  It  is  important  to  allow  sufficient  pause between  the  steps  if  that  is  what  the  child  requires. Praising  and  rewarding  the  child  is  essential,  and  it should immediately follow good cooperation."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nMany children and adolescents with ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders use pictures or photographs as an aid in communication. The dentist can easily create this type of individually customized aid by using a digital camera and a printer. The set of photos should include pictures of the dental clinic, as well as the dentist and the staff whom the patient will meet. A photo of an open mouth will symbolize 'open your mouth,' and other  useful  pictures  can  depict  a  toothbrush,  equipment for prophylaxis, a mirror, the operatory lamp, and the dental chair. The photographs can be arranged in a photo album in the sequence the patient will see them at the appointment (Bäckman & Pilebro 1999). The album also can be used as a pedagogic tool both at home when preparing for the visit and during the appointment as an aid  to  communicate  what  will  happen  next.  Knowing what will happen is probably one of the most important factors to reduce anxiety and prevent behavior management problems in all children. For children with neuropsychiatric disorders, it may be more difficult to ensure that the child fully understands what will happen  and  that  she  feels  at  ease  with  that  information. Pedagogic tools like the photos in the album or written social  stories  describing  the  expected  course  of  events are  very  useful  and  function  as  an  itinerary  or  travel plan for the appointment. Parents can help with this, as they know what their child will experience during the dental appointment and they will be better prepared to support and encourage their child both before and during the visits.\nIn  most  instances,  parents  should  be  encouraged  to remain with their child during treatment. Many dentists acknowledge that most parents can be helpful, as they signal that the treatment is satisfactory. Further, the children feel safe having someone as a support in the special or strange situation. Undoubtedly, there are exceptions to parental presence. Some fearful or dental phobic parents will not be supportive to the child, and there could be parents who refuse to be present. In some instances, the  dentist  may  not  want  the  parent  present  during treatments like oral surgery.\nThe  introduction  to  treatment  can  be  carried  out by  a  dental  assistant  or  hygienist.  Once  the  child  is judged  to  feel  safe  with  all  introductory  steps,  an examination appointment is scheduled with the dentist,  preferably  with  the  same  personnel  who  performed the introduction.\nPhotographs  are  used  during  this  appointment  to show the child the different steps in treatment. Using the  same  photos  and  having  the  same  hierarchy  of treatment  steps  helps  the  child  to  cooperate  and  feel safe, even when meeting a new member of the dental team.  The  album  signals  that  'this  is  the  way  we  do things here and you, the patient, can rely on us.' This kind of aid is also useful when treating other patients, like patients with ADHD, intellectual disability, or even young or anxious children (Bäckman and Pilebro 1999). Photographs  also  can  serve  as  tools  or  aids  for  tooth brushing at home. For this purpose, photos could show what  will  be  used  to  brush  the  teeth,  toothpaste,  a helping  parent,  and  for  some  patients,  illustrations  of tooth surfaces to be cleaned (Pilebro and Bäckman 2005)."

Some patients do well with light sedation, while others do not. For the latter, general anesthesia  is  often  required  for  comprehensive  dentistry.  Knowing  that  a  child  may  require  a  general anesthetic for treatment, every effort should be made to help  the  patient  remain  healthy.

Hence, it is  something  that  all  dental  health  care  personnel  are likely  to  meet.  More  boys  than  girls  are  diagnosed, although girls, who show fewer observable symptomsas hyperactivity-are supposedly under-diagnosed. The etiology is not fully understood, but it is regarded as a  highly  heritable  disorder  in  most  cases  of  familial origin.  Parents  with  ADHD  have  a  greater  than  50% probability of having a child with ADHD. A majority of children with ADHD have at least one close biological relative who  presents with symptoms  of  ADHD. However, the disorder can also be acquired, and some individuals have a combination of genetic and acquired ADHD. At the present time, it is not possible to distinguish  between  these  two  types  of  ADHD-they  both present similarly, and both usually respond to treatment with  the  same  psycho-stimulant  medication  (Voeller 2004).  ADHD  can  be  considered  a  disorder  of  neurotransmitter function, with particular focus on the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are the main problems in ADHD, and the diagnosis can be of a combined type (most common) in which the individual exhibits symptoms in all domains. Treatment includes both medication  (mainly  with  methylphenidate  or  amphetamine) and psycho-educative strategies with didactic programs for parents and teachers.\nThere is much disagreement regarding the oral health status of children with ADHD. However, it appears that there is a slight increase in risk for dental caries, especially as reports point to higher frequency of food and beverage intakes and a lower frequency of tooth brushing in children and adolescents with ADHD (Blomqvist et al. 2007)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Considerations\nReports  indicate  more  dental  behavior  management problems  and  more  dental  anxiety  in  children  with ADHD (Blomqvist et al. 2006). The reason for this is not fully understood, but it is likely that many children with ADHD have difficulties adjusting their level of activity to the  demand  of  the  dental  setting.  Many  children  and adolescents with ADHD behave and function at a lower age level in the dental setting. If the dental team does not understand the reason behind the child's behavior and does not adapt the treatment and demands to the child's capacities, there is an obvious risk for behavioral problems. Forcing a child to accept treatment is never a good idea. Instead, children with ADHD are often successfully managed when given an appropriate introduction to the treatment. The chances of a successful appointment are enhanced if the child feels safe and trusts the dental team. To achieve this, the dentist must allow himself sufficient time  for  the  treatment. An  environment  that  helps  the child  focus  on  the  dental  treatment  must  be  provided, thus facilitating acceptance of treatment.\nAs for all special child patients, preventing oral health problems and promoting a positive attitude and acceptance of dental care should have the highest priority. Try to reduce disturbing visual and auditory noise to  help  the  child  focus  on  the  treatment.  To  help  the child concentrate, reduce unnecessary sensory input by turning off the radio or music, closing the door to the treatment room to reduce background noise and disturbances,  and  removing  visual  distractors  like  toys  or books.  This  might  seem  strange,  as  it  counters  the working  of  most  dental  offices.  However,  one  of  the problems for children with ADHD is to select and filter the incoming stimuli. They drown in too much input. The  same  caution  applies  to  communication.  Dentists and other health professionals often think that conversation and small talk is beneficial for the patient. While this is true for many patients, this is not the case for children with neuropsychiatric disorders. Like children  with  ASD,  the  child  with  ADHD  needs  to  be informed as to what will happen during the treatment. Again, using photos can be helpful. Further, the child needs to know who they will meet and who will do the treatment,  the  length  of  the  treatment  procedure,  and finally,  what  will  happen  afterward.  Using  direct  and objective guidance during the treatment helps the child\nto focus. It is far better to direct the child by saying 'Sit in the chair,' rather than 'Would you like to sit in the chair?' (Blomqvist 2007). The first statement is a direct instruction, whereas the latter statement could be interpreted  as  a  question.  A  child  may  well  reply  to  the question with a 'No, I don't want to.' In that case, it is next to impossible to proceed with the planned treatment without encountering problems.\nAt this time, readers should have recognized similarities in the approach to many different disabilities. Many of the techniques  used  to  manage  children  with  ASD  are  the same used for other neuropsychiatric disorder including ADHD, for children with intellectual disabilities, and for other children with special needs or anxiety. The key is to select what works best for the individual child."

    "context_enriched_content": "Concluding remarks\nMeeting  patients  with  disabilities  is  not  always  easy, and carrying out dental treatment is even more difficult. While this is something that dental professionals have to accept, we also must be sure that it does not color our views, and care must be taken to avoid discrimination against this large group of individuals.\nResearch  has  shown  that  there  are  several  possible barriers keeping children with disabilities from receiving oral health care on the same premise as others. The barriers involve factors that are related to the child patient, the  family,  and  the  medical  and  dental  health  professionals. The problem is that the oral health of children with disabilities is not a priority issue, and that no-one seems to take an overriding responsibility for this area (Klingberg  and  Hallberg  2012).  Many  of  the  barriers have been identified in this chapter.\nThere is a risk that children with disabilities will not have the same access to dental care or receive the same dental treatment as others. If unattended, this will lead to inequalities in oral health-that is unacceptable. This can be changed. A first step is to learn more about all children-how  they  develop  and  mature  physically, emotionally, and cognitively. Secondly, one should learn more  about  disabilities  and  how  different  diagnoses affect oral and general health. Finally, practice with an open mind. Dentists who are motivated to treat special children will find it both stimulating and rewarding."

    "context_enriched_content": "local anesthesia\nSteven Schwartz\nAri Kupietzky\nOne of the most important and challenging aspects of child  behavior  management  is  pain  control.  Children who undergo early  painful  experiences  during  dental procedures are likely to carry negative feelings toward dentistry  into  adulthood.  Therefore,  it  is  important that clinicians make every effort to minimize pain and discomfort  during  dental  treatment.  The  successful children's dentist must master the skill and art of administering  the  most  painless  injection  possible.  Some clinicians  will  try  to  avoid  the  administration  of  local anesthesia;  however,  this  often  results  in  poor  clinical practice.  As  a  consequence  of  no  local  anesthesia,  a rubber  dam  will  rarely  or  never  be  used  and  cavity preparations  may  be  left  shallow,  with  the  end  result far  from  optimal.  In  addition,  there  are  times  when an    anticipated  'minor'  procedure  becomes  a  major procedure and the patient is placed in a painful situation because of the lack of dental anesthesia.\nOn the other hand, one of the greatest single fears of the pediatric dental patient is 'the needle' (Eichenbaum and Dunn 1971). Childhood fears emanate from many sources, and some can be extremely obscure. One possible cause of general dental anxiety may be previous exposure  to  invasive  medical  care  in  early  childhood (Karjalainen et al. 2003). A recent review (Sokolowski et al.  2010)  on  needle  phobia  presented  several  publications suggesting that the fear of needles may result after a negative experience at a physician's or dentist's office. Many childhood fears are learned and may be the result of early childhood conditioning (i.e., 'shots' administered  from  infancy).  The  average  child  will  receive twenty-one  vaccines  in  up  to  six  to  seven  injections before the age of six. Children may not be   voluntarily cooperative  during  these  immunization  procedures, and sometimes they may be physically restrained. Ost (1991)  examined  subjects  with  injection  phobia,  and showed that 56% could trace their fear back to negative conditioning from a health care experience. The mean age onset was eight years and often correlated with a first-time health care-related appointment. This study also  determined  that  24%  of  the  subjects  could  trace their  phobias  to  having  seen  another  child,  often  a sibling, have a negative experience to needles.\nAs  a  consequence  of  these  conflicting  concerns-the dentist wanting to control pain with local anesthesia and the child fearing the pain of the needle-injection procedures present an almost constant challenge to the dentist's skills.  Thus  the  aims  of  this  chapter,  which  covers  an important aspect of behavior management, are (1) to discuss factors associated with administering injections and (2) to review the most commonly used local anesthetic techniques  for  children.  The  chapter  will  not  present every type of local anesthesia, nor will it include detailed techniques. It will focus instead on the most commonly used injections, with an emphasis on how to administer local anesthesia with minimum pain and maximum effect."

    "context_enriched_content": "administration of local anesthesia\nIt is extremely important for the dentist to have an effective  system  for  the  administration  of  local  anesthesia. Children are very sensitive to body language. Pediatric patients can detect uncertainty or hesitation, which can lead to difficulty. If the dentist's approach, and that of the assistant, are not confident and well-timed, the child may easily  sense  their  attitude  and  resist  every  effort that  they  make  (see  Communication  in  Chapter  Six). Considerable  skill  is  needed  for  administering  local anesthesia  to    children  while  avoiding  behavior  problems. Some of the following clinical procedures, which have been developed over the years, are widely accepted and highly   successful  with  children.  Others,  however, are debatable."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preparation of Patient\nPreparation of the patient prior to injection consists of two components: mental and physical.\nMental preparation begins with explaining the anesthesia administration process to the child in terminology that  they  can  understand.  The  child  may  be  sitting upright in a non-threatened position. Consider the following narrative:\n'Today I'm going to put your tooth to sleep, wash some germs out of your tooth and fix your tooth and make it all  better.  When  your  tooth  falls  asleep  your  lip  and tongue will feel fat and funny for a little while. You will not look funny or fat. You will just feel funny and fat.\nTo make your tooth fall asleep, I am going to use sleepy juice. Only your tooth will go to sleep, not you! The sleepy juice doesn't taste so good, so as soon as I put it next to your tooth, I will wash it away with some water. Oh, and while I put the juice next to your tooth I will give you a little pinch. A pinch only hurts a little. Not a lot. Let's pretend to do it. Not for real, just pretend. I'm going to show you everything I do so you can see how easy this is.'\nThe dentist asks the child to pinch her arm. Some   children may hesitate, but after a little coaxing, they will happily proceed to pinch the dentist. At this point, the dentist may turn around and, with a smile, inform the accompanying parent that kids love this part of the procedure. During the pinch the dentist says: 'That hurt me, but not a lot. It hurt very little. I do not need to cry for such a little pinch.'\nThe  dentist  now  takes  the  child's  arm  and  gently pinches the skin. The slight amount of pain created will not upset most children, and the child has now learned an objective association for the expectation of the injection, 'the pinch.' The dentist proceeds to gently pinch the cheek or gingiva adjacent to the tooth and immediately spray water, demonstrating the feeling of the intraoral pinch and subsequent washing away of the bitter sleepy juice. The dentist then says, 'you are a good boy (or girl) and I am sure you can stand a little pinch like that.' An overwhelming majority of children will agree and will cooperate during the injection."

    "context_enriched_content": "Chair Position\nSome authors have suggested giving injections, particularly mandibular blocks, with the patient in a somewhat upright position, resulting in the patient's mandible being approximately  parallel  to  the  floor  and  the  clinician's elbow close to the body. Most pediatric dentists prefer to deliver local anesthetics with the patient in a supine position (Figure 8-1). This is especially true for those using custom-made benches, as shown in Chapter Seventeen. The  anatomical  positions  and  injections  are  essentially\nFigure 8-1. Most pediatric dentists prefer to deliver local anesthetics with the patient in a supine position.\nthe same. However, when the child is in the supine position,  the  mandible  is  at  approximately  a  thirty-degree angle to the floor, and the clinician's elbow will be high, with the arm nearly parallel to the floor. The patient is positioned with the head and heart parallel to the floor and the feet slightly elevated. Positioning the patient in this  manner  reduces  the  incidence  of  syncope  that  can occur  as  a  result  of  increased  anxiety.  In  addition,  the patient's sudden movements are more easily controlled.\n'It will be much easier for me to see your teeth if you lay back, so I will give you a ride and make the chair go back. Before I give you the pinch I will practice with you  again  and  explain  everything.'  Repeating  the explanation and pinch while the child is reclined may not be necessary with all children. In addition, if the child  has  been  holding  a  hand  mirror,  it  should  be taken by the assistant with the promise that it will be shortly returned."

    "context_enriched_content": "Assembling the Syringe\nThere  is  debate  among  clinicians  as  to  whether  the syringe and its components should be assembled in or out of view of the patient. The majority of pediatric dentists attempt to keep anesthetic syringes out of the sight of  child  patients  (Starkey  1983).  Proponents  of  assembling  the  syringe  out  of  the  patient's  sight  assert  that most  children  have  developed  a  fear  of  the  injection during prior visits to the pediatrician, and the slightest suspicion that they are getting an injection will set them off.  This  is  especially  true  when  told  stories  by  older siblings  and  friends.  In  addition,  the  word  'injection' has not been used. From the perspective of the child, he or she is simply getting a special pinch with sleepy juice. Introducing the syringe may complicate the process. In\nFigure 8-2. With the proper technique, the child need not ever see the syringe. It is always passed and held in blind spots, away from the patient's view: under the child's chin (a) and behind her head (b).\naddition, some children may insist on removing the cap, thus  exposing  the  needle.  With  proper  technique  the child  need  not  ever  see  the  syringe,  which  is  always passed and held in blind spots, away from the patient's view (Figure 8-2).\nProponents of assembling the syringe in view of the patient  assert  that  doing  so  acts  as  a  desensitization technique. The patient has the opportunity to touch and feel the individual, non-threatening components, reducing  patient  apprehension  linked  to  prior  injections.  Clinicians  who  opt  to  show  the  syringe  and  its assembly in view of the patient may use the following narrative during syringe assembly.\nCase 8.1,  Discussion : Option 1. The dentist answers: 'I  am not giving you a shot, only a pinch.' The child suddenly moves and sees the syringe. He screams: 'You are a liar! You are giving me a shot!' The boy manages to jump off the  chair  and  run  out  of  the  room. A  severe behavior problem ensued, and no amount of talk from the dentist made any difference to the child. The parents opted to switch to another dentist.\n'I'm going to make the tooth go to sleep and feel fat and funny with my sleepy juice. The sleepy juice is kept in this little glass jar.'  (Allow  the  child  to  hold  the cartridge.) 'We place the jar in a special water sprayer,' (allow  the  child  to  hold  the  syringe)  'and  we  place  a plastic straw at the end of the water sprayer.' (Allow the child to hold the covered needle.)"

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 8.1\nJack, a six-year-old boy, is seated in the dental chair for his first restorative appointment. The dentist explains to Jack that she will be putting his tooth to sleep by pinching  the  cheek  near  the  tooth  and,  at  the  same  time, squirting sleeping juice around the tooth. Jack becomes excited and upset. He asks the dentist: ' Are you going to give me a shot? I don't want a shot. Shots hurt. Show me the shot!'\nOption 2 . The dentist answers: 'As I told you before, I am going to give you a little pinch and put your tooth to sleep. Let's pretend and pinch your cheek. See? It only  hurts  a  little.  Now  let's  do  it  for  real.'  Jack answers: 'How do you squirt the sleepy juice? Show it to  me!'  Dentist:  'I  am  like  a  magician.  Magicians never reveal their tricks. Maybe later, if you are a good patient,  I  will  show  you  how  I  do  it.'  Most  patients will  not  ask  to  see  the  syringe  at  the  end  of  their treatment.\nOption  3 .  The  dentist  answers:  'Yes,  I  am  going to give to you a shot, if that is what you want to call it. I know how to give a shot in a special way so that it does not hurt a lot, only a little. I don't call it a shot, I call it a pinch.'  Jack  answers:  'Show  it  to  me!'  The  dentist shows Jack the covered syringe.\nThere are unlimited ways to successfully manage the above scenario. However, it is obvious that Option 1 is not one of them. The dentist lied to the child, thereby losing  all  credibility.  In  Option  2  the  dentist  never acknowledged that a shot would be given, yet she did not deny it either. She never stated that she would not be giving  an  injection.  In  many  instances  the  child  will receive the injection, never aware of it being a 'shot'just  an  uncomfortable  pinch.  The  child  was  worried about the shot, not the pinch.\nJack had been adversely preconditioned to injections. His  fear  of  the  shot  might  have  emanated  from  his experience  with  vaccinations.  He  disliked  them  and remembered  crying.  Although  he  returned  from  his first dental appointment  excited and  pleased, he became very anxious in anticipation of the next visit. He  had  he  told  his  best  friend  in  kindergarten  how much  fun  the  visit  was.  The  friend  responded  by warning him of his next visit, when the dentist would give him a shot."

Most clinicians prefer to keep the uncapped needle out of the patient's line of sight. The child should not be asked to close her eyes, as that is usually a sign that something bad or painful is about to occur. In addition, pain perception may be enhanced  with  eyes  closed.  Instead,  the  assistant should pass the uncapped syringe behind the patient's head (Figure 8-2). Once the assistant has handed the syringe  to  the  dentist  and  has  freed  her  hands,  she positions them over the patient. The assistant should not  actively  restrain  or  even  touch  the  child's  arms unless  an  attempt  is  made  by  the  patient  to  lift  her arms to reject treatment (Figure 8-3). Just touching the arms, as if to restrain, may cause apprehension in the child and, at that moment, the youngster may attempt to resist physically. Instead, the dental assistant should position her hands above the child's hands to intercept any untoward movement."

    "context_enriched_content": "Topical Anesthesia\nTopical anesthetics are available in gel, liquid, ointment, patch, and pressurized spray forms. Topical anesthetics are effective to a depth of 2-3  mm and are limited in their effect to reduce the discomfort of the initial penetration of  the  needle  into  the  mucosa:  they  offer  little  benefit when performing  a  mandibular  block.  The  benefits  of topical anesthetics may not be entirely pharmacological; a  psychological  advantage  may  ensue.  A  number  of investigations  have  compared  topical  anesthetics  with placebo intraorally with conflicting  results(Meechan 2008). Some show positive benefits from the use of topical anesthesia before needle insertion and others do not. There  is  no  evidence  that  topical  anesthetics  have  any value in reducing the discomfort of regional block administrations such as inferior alveolar nerve block injections (Meechan 2002). In addition, their disadvantages include a disagreeable taste that may be a cause of patient discomfort,  sometimes  eliciting  crying  even  before  the actual injection is given. In addition, the length of application time may increase apprehension of the approaching  procedure  in  the  pediatric  patient.  The  application duration time is a crucial factor governing effectiveness\n(beyond a placebo). The onset times of topical anesthetics range  between  thirty  seconds  and  five  minutes.  Many clinicians  do  not  wait  for  the  anesthetic  to  take  effect; they proceed with the injection almost immediately after placing the topical. In a survey on local anesthesia, Kohli and  colleagues  (2001)  reported  that  two-thirds  of  the responding pediatric dentists waited a minute or less. In addition, most practitioners responded that patients disliked  the  taste,  consistency,  and  the  warm  or  burning sensation  of  the  topical  anesthetics.  A  majority  of  the respondents  (86%)  always  used  a  topical  anesthetic, while 9% sometimes used a topical anesthetic, 4% rarely used topical anesthetic, and 1% reported that they never used a topical anesthetic. Another reason for widespread use of  topical  may  be  the  expectation  of  the  accompanying parent, who presumes that its use is crucial for a painless injection. However, if a child has been referred due to behavior problems and the previous dentist used a topical, it might be best to avoid it.\nBenzocaine is a very common topical anesthetic. It is not known to produce systemic toxicity in adults, but can produce local allergic reactions. However, the Food and Drug Administration announced in April 2011 that 'Topical  benzocaine  sprays,  gels,  and  liquids  used  as anesthesia during medical procedures and for analgesia from  tooth  and  gum  pain  may  cause  methemoglobinemia, a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition.' Children  younger  than  two  years  appear  to  be  at particular risk. In the most severe cases, methemoglobinemia can result in death. Patients who develop methemoglobinemia  may  experience  signs  and  symptoms such  as  pale  gray-  or  blue-colored  skin,  lips  and  nail\nbeds; headaches; lightheadedness; shortness of breath; fatigue; and rapid heart rate."

    "context_enriched_content": "Needle Selection\nControversy  centers  on  both  the  gauge  and  length  of needles.  The  most  common  gauges  are  25-,  27-,  and 30-gauge.  Needles  come  in  three  lengths:  long,  short, and  ultrashort.  Gauge  refers  to  the  diameter  of  the lumen of the needle; the smaller the number, the greater the  diameter  of  the  lumen.  For  example,  a  30-gauge needle has a smaller internal diameter than a 25-gauge needle. There is a trend among dentists toward the use of smaller-diameter needles on the assumption that they are  less  traumatic  to  the  patient.  Proponents  of  large gauges claim that these needles yield better aspiration and may cause less pain during initial penetration of the mucosa, believing that needles with a smaller diameter result in less injection pain than wider-diameter needles. Studies  have  refuted  both  points.  Trapp  and  Davies (1980) and Delgado-Molina and colleagues (2003) reported  that  no  significant  differences  existed  in  the ability to aspirate blood through 25-, 27-, and 30-gauge dental needles. On the contrary, the studies concluded that there is increased resistance to aspiration of blood through a thinner needle (e.g., 30-gauge) compared with a  larger-diameter  needle  (e.g.,  27-  or  25-gauge).  With regard  to  pain  experienced  by  the  patient,  numerous studies have reported that patients are unable to differentiate among 23-, 25-, 27-, and 30-gauge needles-no significant  differences  in  the  perception  of  pain  produced by them were reported (Reed et al. 2012).\nPain associated with dental anesthesia results mostly from the pressure caused when the anesthetic solution is injected into the mucosa-especially during the first few seconds-and less so from the actual needle penetration.  The  pressure  produced  is  greater  when  using high gauges than with lower gauges. Needle deflection along the axis of the bevel and breakage must also be considered when choosing the gauge. The smaller the diameter  of  the  needle,  the  more  it  deflects.  Thirtygauge  needles  deflect  significantly,  whereas  25-gauge needles  essentially  do  not  deflect  at  all.  Likewise, 25-gauge needles very rarely, if ever, break during an intraoral injection. This is an important advantage when treating  a  child  who  may  make  sudden  movements. Malamed et al. (2010) reported that 99% of the needles that do break are 30-gauge needles. In his classic textbook, The Handbook of Local Anesthesia , he recommends using the smallest gauge (largest diameter) needle available, which allows for easier aspiration, less deflection of  the  needle  as  it  perforates  the  soft  tissue,  and  less chance of breakage at the hub.\nTraditionally, clinicians were taught to decide on the length in relation to the type of injection (block or infiltration), the size of the patient, and the thickness of the tissue. Although a long needle has been recommended for  inferior  alveolar  injections,  short  needles  seem  to offer better control to the dentist dealing with children. The long needle recommendation relates to the possibility  of  needle  fracture.  Proponents  of  long  needles claim that after a needle fracture, a portion of the needle is  exposed for easy removal. However, in the event of this  rare  happenstance,  fracture  usually  occurs  at  the hub.  In  addition,  it  is  never  recommended  to  insert  a short needle to the hub. Thus, long needles seem to offer little advantage over short ones, and the authors recommend the short needle for all local anesthetics (excluding the intraligamental injection for which  extra  short needles  are  indicated)  for  children,  regardless  of  their age and the type of injection."

Most  educators  recommend  slow  injections because  a  rapidly  expelled  solution  causes  discomfort.  But  how  slow  is  'slow?'  Based  on  videotaped procedures, Starkey and Wright (1983) calculated that a  slow  injection  takes  approximately  45  seconds, using  an  entire  1.8 ml  cartridge.  In  most  pediatric cases,  two-thirds  of  a  cartridge  are  sufficient,  the injection  time  being  30  seconds  or  less.  Malamed (2012) recommends an injection time of one minute or more.  However,  the  authors'  experience  with  pediatric patients is not to prolong the injection procedure.

When children  are  asked  for  signs  or  symptoms  of  anesthesia, their  responses  are  often  unreliable.  Sometimes,  by simply observing the child patient sitting in the dental chair and watching the mouth movements, an experienced  dentist  will  intuitively  know  that  the  injection has taken effect. Asking a child 'Are you numb?' usually will not provide the answer. Most children cannot express  the  feeling  of  numbness  or  understand  its meaning. The clinician has to point to non-anesthetized areas and have the child compare them to the anesthetized  region,  saying,  'Tell  me  where  it  feels  funny.' Many  dentists  have  been  trained  to  routinely  probe anesthetized  areas  with  an  explorer.  This  does  not necessarily indicate profound block anesthesia, and it causes delays in the procedure, which can build apprehension in the child patient. Another approach following a mandibular block is to observe the external signs carefully,  question  the  patient,  evaluate  for  positive responses,  and  then  proceed,  placing  the  rubber  dam clamp if restorative dentistry is to be performed. While placing the clamp, the dentist should watch the child's reactions, particularly the eyes. If profound anesthesia has  been  obtained,  there  will  be  no  flinching  and  the procedure can continue. On the other hand, if there is any discomfort, steps can be retraced and appropriate measures taken."

The authors' clinical impression is  that  the  best  choice  is  the  maxillary  supraperiosteal injection.

Inject several drops of anesthetic before advancing the needle. While injecting, wiggle the patient's  cheek.  Slowly  advance  the  needle  toward  the target while injecting up to a 1/4 cartridge of anesthetic to  anesthetize  the  soft  tissue  ahead  of  the  advancing needle, so that the needle is constantly moving into anesthetized tissue. Aspirate. The depth of insertion will vary with  the  type  of  injection;  however,  one  should  never insert a needle in its entirety to the hub. Although it is a rare occurrence,  retrieving  a  broken  needle  fully embedded  in  soft  tissue  is  extremely  difficult.  After confirming  a  negative  aspiration,  the  injection  process should take under one minute. Continue injecting during needle  retrieval.  The  clinician  should  be  careful  not  to inject a greater amount of anesthetic than recommended for the patient's weight. Continue to speak to the patient throughout the injection process. Close observation of the patient's  eye  and  hand  movements, along with crying, will alert the clinician to patient discomfort.\nUpon completion of treatment  and  dismissal  of  the patient, the clinician says to the patient with the accompanying adult present: 'You were a terrific helper. You sat still and we finished quickly. We are a good team! I'm giving  you  an  extra  special  sticker  that  says  'Careful! Tooth,  tongue,  lips  asleep.'  Although  we're  finished with today's treatment,  your  tooth  will  be  asleep  and your lip and tongue will feel fat and funny for another hour. Don't eat until your lip and tongue no longer feel fat and funny.'\nSome children who did not cry during treatment may begin to  do  so  after  treatment,  complaining  of  'pain' and telling the parent that their mouth hurts. Showing the child the mouth in a mirror will help alleviate concerns that the area is swollen. At this point, the dentist should repeat that the child's mouth is numb and the feeling the patient is experiencing is not pain, but rather numbness. A child who has never had an anesthetic may ask what the word 'numb' means. A possible explanation is as follows: 'Do you remember when you sat on your foot and your foot went to sleep? Well, that is sort of  what  numb  feels  like.  Your  mouth  is  asleep.  Don't worry, it will wake up soon and feel regular.'"

While a supraperiosteal injection (infiltration) may provide adequate anesthesia for the primary incisors and molars, it is not as effective for providing complete anesthesia for the mandibular permanent molars. In addition, it provides profound pulpal anesthesia and may be indicated  when  pulpal  treatment  is  anticipated.  A  major consideration for IANB in the pediatric patient is that the  mandibular  foramen  is  situated  at  a  lower  level (below the occlusal plane) than in an adult. Thus, the injection  is  made  slightly  lower  and  more  posteriorly than in an adult (Figure 8-7).\nPhysical position can be an important factor when the dentist is injecting children, particularly when administering a mandibular block. To accomplish the mandibular  injection  for  the  right  side  of  the  mandible,  the right-handed dentist approaches the face from the front. The left thumb is placed with the middle of the thumbnail  at  the  coronoid  notch  and  lightly  over  the  deep tendon of the temporalis muscle (Figure 8-8). The pterygomandibular raphe is medial to the thumb. The needle penetrates the tissue at the middle of the thumbnail and is thus carried between the deep tendon of the temporalis laterally and the pterygomandibular raphe medially, entering  the  mandibular  sulcus  at  the  level  of  the lingular notch. Unfortunately, this injection provides the dentist with little control over a child's head movement.\nOn  the  opposite,  or  the  left  side  of  the  arch,  the right-handed  operator's  arm  may  be  placed  over  the head of the patient and the left thumb on the anterior border of the ramus, with the forefinger just anterior to the mandibular angle and the middle finger just above the  mandibular  angle.

When the right-handed operator administers a left mandibular block and places the left forearm over a child's forehead, this technique controls head movements and helps to keep the syringe out of the child's view. For these reasons, when given a choice between right and left sides, many dentists prefer beginning with the left mandibular block.\nTechnique:\n- Lay the thumb on the occlusal surface of the molars, with  the  tip  of  the  thumb  resting  on  the  internal oblique ridge and the ball of the thumb resting on the retromolar fossa. Support the mandible during the injection by resting the ball of the middle finger on the posterior border of the mandible.\n- The barrel of the syringe should be directed   between the two primary molars on the opposite side of the arch.\n- The best way to visualize the lateral positioning of the needle prior to penetrating soft tissue is to look for  the  depression  seen  on  the  immediate  lateral aspect of the pterygomandibular raphe while asking the patient to open as wide as possible and pulling the cheek taut (Figure 8-9).\nFigure 8-9.

She needs shallow occlusal restorations in both teeth. Carol's dentist believes that the teeth should be  anesthetized,  but  is  concerned  that  administering a  mandibular  block  anesthetic  to  the  active  child  may be difficult.\nCase 8.2, Discussion : Giving the active young child a mandibular  block  injection  may  be  difficult,  and  it also has three other disadvantages. First, this is Carol's initial  experience  with  dental  anesthesia,  and  longlasting  numbness  in  the  tongue  and  buccal  mucosa could adversely affect her permanent attitude. Second, it can be difficult to render a painless block injection to a highly active child, and the dentist obviously wants Carol  to  experience  minimal  discomfort.  Third,  with long-lasting anesthetic, the active youngster may traumatize the soft tissues postoperatively. Thus, the concern of the dentist in this case is legitimate. The dentist should consider using buccal supraperiosteal (infiltration)  anesthesia  in  place  of  a  mandibular  block  injection. Two main advantages of this approach are the ease of administration and the minimal period of time that the  child  patient's  mouth  is  anesthetized.  The  dentist injects  up  to  1 ml  of  local  anesthetic  solution  in  the mucobuccal  fold  adjacent  to  the  mandibular  primary tooth to be restored. In addition, the papilla should be anesthetized on the buccal, followed by penetration of the  needle  to  the  lingual  side.  In  addition,  anesthesia may be supplemented by an intra-ligamental injection (Figure 8-10).\nFigure 8-10. The dentist injects up to 1 ml of local anesthetic solution in the mucobuccal fold adjacent to the mandibular primary tooth to be restored. In addition, the papilla should be anesthetized on the buccal followed by penetration of the needle to the lingual side (a). Anesthesia may also be supplemented by an intra-ligamental injection (b).\nThe supraperiosteal anesthesia technique is useful for minor  operative  procedures.  The  problem  with  this technique is that profound mandibular anesthesia cannot  be  reliably  achieved.  Starkey  suggests  that  the technique  works  best  for  young  children  (up  to  five years of age) who require restoration of mandibular first primary molars, cuspids, and incisors.

Malamed  (2012)  recommends  that  the  clinician  forewarn the patient that there might be discomfort so that they are mentally prepared. If the experience is atraumatic, the patient bestows the 'golden hands' award on the clinician. If it is painful, the clinician can console the patient  with  'I'm  sorry.  I  told  you  that  it  might  be uncomfortable' (avoid using the word 'hurt').\nThe steps in atraumatic administration of anesthesia in all palatal areas are as follows:\n- Provide  adequate  topical  anesthesia  (at  least  two minutes) in the injection area. The applicator should be  held  in  place  by  the  clinician  while  applying\nsufficient pressure to cause blanching. Alternatively, clinicians who do not use topical anesthesia apply finger  pressure  for  a  few  seconds  at  the  injection site. This may reduce the pain caused by the initial penetration of the needle.\n- Use pressure anesthesia at the injection site before and during needle penetration and solution deposition. The pressure is maintained with a cotton applicator or with a finger with enough pressure to cause blanching.\n- Maintain  control  over  the  needle.  The  use  of  an ultrashort  needle  will  result  in  less  deflection  and greater control. A finger rest will aid in stabilizing the needle (Figure 8-11).\n- Inject the anesthetic solution slowly. Because of the density  of  the  palatal  soft  tissues  and  their  firm adherence to the hard palate, there is little room to spread  during  solution  deposition.  Slow  injection reduces  tissue  pressure  and  results  in  a  less  traumatic  experience.  During  the  injection,  ask  the patient to raise a leg off of the chair."

All  carious  lesions are  of  moderate  depth. The  child  is  sedated  with  conscious sedation. The dentist is debating whether or not local anesthesia should be used. She is considering labial and palatal injections.\n(b)\nFigure 8-11. For palatal injections, the use of an ultrashort needle will result in less deflection and greater control (a). A finger rest will aid in stabilizing the needle (b).\nCase 8.3, Discussion : Although dentists treating children should always anesthetize for restorative treatment, there are exceptions. With proper technique, caries removal can be achieved with minimum pain in this  region.  Tooth  preparation  for  a  strip  crown  is minimal. In most instances, indirect pulp capping will be  the  treatment  of  choice  avoiding  pulpal  pain.  In addition,  the  child  is  sedated  and  attention  to  correct doses  of  local  anesthesia  must  be  made,  taking  into consideration the weight of the child and the interaction with the sedative.\n(a)\nThe  actual  injection  may  be  just  as  painful  as  the restorative  procedure.  It  takes  considerable  skill  to administer  a  pain-free  anterior  injection.  Even  those dentists  possessing  this  skill  worry  about  hurting  the child  patient.  In  addition,  the  palatal  injection,  which can  be  painful,  should  be  avoided  when  possible.  In most instances, a labial injection will suffice.\nIf the dentist anticipates pulpal treatment or possibly a  complication  which  may  involve  extraction,  local anesthesia is mandatory. For the supraperiosteal injection on the facial side for the primary anterior teeth, the soft  tissues  are  retracted  to  reveal  the  junction  of  the firmly fixed gingival mucosa and the loose or movable alveolar mucosa. A topical anesthetic may be applied to the area, with the puncture point located in the movable alveolar mucosa, very close to the junction with the gingival mucosa. The dentist deposits a drop or two of solution immediately and then waits a few seconds before advancing the needle to a point opposite the apex of the tooth. In the primary dentition the needle will usually not be advanced more than a millimeter or two. Note that in Figure 8-12, in the primary dentition, the apex of the teeth will be very near the point of insertion of the needle.  Following  labial  anesthesia,  palatal  anesthesia\n(b)\nFigure 8-12. In the primary dentition, the apex of the teeth (a) will be very near the point of insertion of the needle at the level of mucobuccal fold (b).\nmay be  accomplished  by  applying  digital  pressure  to the palate opposite the involved teeth and inserting the needle under the finger with the bevel of the needle flat against  the  mucosa  on  the  side  of  the  papilla. A  very small amount  of anesthesia solution is deposited. Blanching will occur and is a sign of proper technique."

    "context_enriched_content": "Supraperiosteal Injections (Local Infiltration)\nSupraperiosteal  injection  (commonly  known  as  local infiltration) is indicated whenever dental procedures are confined to a localized area in either the maxilla or mandible. The more appropriate term for this type of anesthesia  is  'supraperiosteal'  rather  than  'infiltration' because supraperiosteal indicates the placement of the anesthetic, whereas infiltration refers to the technique of injecting  the  solutions  directly  into  the  tissues  to  be treated. The terminal endings of the nerves innervating the region are anesthetized. The indications are pulpal anesthesia  of  all  the  maxillary  teeth  (permanent  and primary), mandibular anterior teeth (primary and permanent),  and  mandibular  primary  molars  when treatment is limited to one or two teeth. It also provides soft tissue anesthesia as a supplement to regional blocks. It  is  contraindicated in areas where dense bone covers the apices of the teeth (i.e., the permanent first molars in children). It is not recommended for larges areas due to the need for multiple needle insertions and the necessity to  administer  larger  total  volumes  of  local  anesthetic that may lead to toxicity.\nA number of studies have reported on the effectiveness of injecting local anesthetic solution in the mucobuccal fold between the roots of the primary mandibular molars (McDonald 2011). When comparing the effectiveness  of  mandibular  infiltration  to  mandibular block  anesthesia  it  was  generally  agreed  that  the  two techniques were equally effective for restorative procedures, but the mandibular block was more effective for pulpotomies and extractions than mandibular infiltration. The mandibular infiltration should be considered in    situations  where  one  wants  to  perform  bilateral restorative procedures without anesthetizing the tongue. Bilateral anesthesia of the tongue is uncomfortable for both children and adults.\nTechnique:\n- Retract  the  cheek  so  the  tissue  of  the  mucobuccal fold is taut.\n- Apply topical anesthetic.\n- Orient the needle bevel toward the bone.\n- Penetrate the mucous membrane mesial to the primary molar to be anesthetized, directing the needle to a position between the roots of the tooth. Slowly inject a small amount of anesthetic while advancing\n- the  needle  to  the  desired  position  and  injecting about a 1/2 cartridge of anesthetic.\n- If lingual tissue anesthesia is necessary (rubber dam clamp  placement),  then  one  can  inject  anesthetic solution  directly  into  the  lingual  tissue  at  the  free gingival margin, or one can insert the needle interproximally from the buccal and deposit anesthesia as the needle is advanced lingually.\n- The needle is withdrawn and recapped.\n- Wait one minute before commencing treatment."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 8.4\nSara, a five-year-old, required a large restoration on her maxillary  second  primary  molar.  The  dentist  deposited 1 ml of local anesthetic supraperiostaily and between the buccal roots of the tooth to be restored. During the cavity preparation, Sara cried and complained of pain. The dentist re-anesthetized the child, who continued to complain, 'It hurts.' Was Sara misbehaving?\nCase 8.4, Discussion : The dentist will need to determine if the child's reaction is indeed due to pain or perhaps a behavior management issue. In order to rule out pain, the  dentist  needs  to  be  confident  that  the  anesthesia technique used was correct.\nSometimes  it  can  be  difficult  to  discern  actual  pain from an avoidance tactic. In this case, however, the possibility of inadequate anesthesia should be considered. Although  most  dentists  probably  use  supraperiosteal anesthesia for operative procedures on maxillary second primary molars, bone thickness is a problem. The   second primary molar roots lie deep within the zygomatic process of the maxillary bone. If a supraperiosteal injection is to be effective, the anesthetic solution must penetrate a considerable amount (about 1 cm) of bone. Therefore, for  more  profound  anesthesia,  a  posterior  superior injection is desirable. Anesthesia in this region is not a problem  in  adults  because  the  forward  growth  of  the maxilla  carries  the  second  premolar  anterior  to  the zygomatic  process  of  the  alveolar  bone.  In  adults,  a supraperiosteal injection provides adequate anesthesia because  the  second  premolar  has  only  a  thin  layer  of alveolar bone overlying its buccal root.\nThe possibility that the anesthesia given to Sara may have been inadequate is quite probable. Supraperiosteal injections often have to be made over both the mesial and distal roots to anesthetize the middle and superior nerve branches. When performing restorative dentistry on the maxillary first permanent molar, two buccal   injections are\nneeded for profound anesthesia. In addition to a tuberosity injection, a supraperiosteal injection is required over the mesial buccal root, since this root is innervated by the middle superior alveolar nerve. A single injection midway between the  buccal  roots  does  not  routinely  yield  profound  anesthesia.  For  the  maxillary  second  permanent molar, only a tuberosity injection is necessary.\nFor the sake of continued discussion, the same case occurs, but both buccal injections were given and Sara starts crying hysterically as the high-speed drill touches the tooth.\nIn this case, the dentist is confident that the injection has taken effect. Sara is reacting to the sound of the drill. She  expects  pain.  The  child  was  previously  treated without  local  anesthesia  and  associated  the  activation and sound of the high-speed drill to pain. Whenever the previous dentist used it, it hurt. A patient's apprehension can often cause local anesthetic failure (Kaufman et al. 1984). Nerve conduction may be blocked successfully from a neurophysiological perspective, but as soon as the patient anticipates or hears the sound of the drill, she perceives pain. The patient will need to be reconditioned. As soon as Sara experiences a painless procedure, she will understand and cooperate. This problem can be resolved by discussing the procedure with the child and explaining  that  every  dentist  is  different  and  today's appointment will be better than her previous one.\nTo  avoid  this  scenario,  the  dentist  should  always begin procedures involving a high-speed without initial contact with the tooth. Rather, he should activate it  next  to  the  tooth  without  contact,  which  emits  the characteristic sound, thus isolating the sound of the drill from the cutting of tooth structure. If the parent is present, let the parent know this without alerting the patient to the test. If the child starts to complain of pain, the dentist shows the child with the aid of a mirror that the drill is not touching the tooth. The child is reassured that all will be all right. The drill is once again used, not touching the tooth at first, and finally cutting the tooth begins."

    "context_enriched_content": "Periodontal Ligament Injection (Intraligamentary Injection)\nThe periodontal ligament (PDL) injection has been used for a number of years as either a method of obtaining primary anesthesia for one or two teeth or as a supplement to infiltration or block techniques. The technique's primary advantage is that it provides pulpal anesthesia for  30-45  minutes  without  an  extended  period  of  soft tissue anesthesia, and is therefore extremely useful when bilateral treatment is planned. It is useful in pediatric or disabled patients when there is concern of postoperative tissue trauma to the lip or tongue. Intraligamental anesthesia delivered by a high pressure syringe is often associated  with  damage  to  the  periodontal  tissue,  which results from the physical trauma formed at the time of injection and from the cytotoxic effects of the anesthesia. Damage heals within a few weeks. This is of particular concern to the pediatric dentist treating primary teeth.\nIn their study, Brannstrom et al. (1984) suggested that developmental disturbances to the underlying permanent tooth buds might occur. A high-pressure intraligamental anesthesia  injection  was  used  to  anesthetize  sixteen monkey  primary  teeth.  Teeth  in  the  contralateral  positions were not injected and served as controls. Hypoplasia or hypomineralization defects developed in fifteen permanent teeth, but in none of the controls. The position of  the  enamel  lesions  indicated  that  the  disturbance occurred at the same time on all affected teeth. Based on this study's findings, the use of intraligamental anesthesia on primary teeth with a developing permanent tooth bud has been contraindicated (Moore et al. 2011). However, a clinical study by Ashkenazi et al. (2010) using a computerized syringe system for delivery of intraligamental anesthesia concluded that it does not damage the underlying permanent dental bud in children four years or older. In any event, its use may be beneficial to the pediatric dentist when treating permanent molars. This is also a good technique for removing lower bicuspids bilaterally for orthodontic  treatments.  Since  it  is  injected  into  a  site  with limited blood circulation, the technique is also advantageous for treating patients with bleeding disorders.\nThe  PDL  technique  is  simple,  requires  only  a  small amount of  anesthesia,  and  produces  instant  anesthesia. Two devices were developed for this technique and were very popular for a period, the PERIPRESS (PERIPRESS®, Universal  Dental  Implements,  Edison,  NJ)  syringe/pen and  the  Ligmaject  syringe  (Ligmaject,  IMA  Associates, Boston, MA). However, the authors' experience allows for the  use  of  a  standard  syringe  fitted  with  an  ultrashort needle.  The  ultrashort  needle  is  placed  in  the  gingival sulcus on the mesial surface and advanced along the root surface  until  resistance  is  met.  Initial  finger  pressure  is applied  on  the  attached  gingiva.  In  multirooted  teeth, injections are made mesially and distally. If lingual anesthesia is needed, the procedure is repeated in the lingual sulcus. Approximately 0.2 ml of anesthetic is injected.\nConsiderable effort is needed to express the anesthetic solution, placing a great deal of pressure on the anesthetic cartridge with the possibility of breakage. There are syringes specifically designed to enclose the cartridge and provide protection from breakage. Since so little anesthetic solution is necessary, Malamed (2012) suggests that when  using  a conventional syringe, expressing  half  the  contents  of  the  cartridge  prior  to injection will reduce the pressure exerted on the walls of the cartridge and reduce the likelihood of breakage."

    "context_enriched_content": "Computer-Controlled Anesthetic Delivery System\n'The  Wand'  currently  named  CompuDent  (Milestone Scientific  Inc,  Livingston,  NJ.),  is  a  computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery system. The latest version of the Wand is called the single tooth anesthesia (STA) system. The  systems  consist  of  a  conventional  local  anesthetic needle inserted into a disposable pen-like syringe. A footcontrolled  microprocessor  controls  the  delivery  of  the anesthetic solution through the syringe at a constant flow rate,  volume,  and  pressure.  Studies  with  children  have shown contradicting  results.  Some  reported  lower  pain ratings for injections with the Wand® in comparison to injections with the traditional syringe (Gibson et al. 2000, Allen et al. 2002, Palm et al. 2004). Others found no differences between the two injection methods (Asarch et al. 1999, Ram et al. 2003). A disadvantage of the system which is  especially  important  when  treating  a  child  patient  is the extended injection time of computerized systems. The injection  time  of  the  Wand  is  much  longer  than  that  of the traditional method, so children who already react negatively to an injection seem to be in distress longer with the Wand system. Versloot et al. (2008) reported the mean injection time with the Wand being three times as long as with  the  traditional  syringe.  The  authors'  experience  is that with proper technique, the traditional syringe can be used successfully with most, if not all, patients."

    "context_enriched_content": "Postoperative Soft Tissue Injury\nAccidental biting or chewing of the lip, tongue or cheek is a problem seen in very young pediatric and disabled patients. Soft tissue anesthesia lasts longer than pulpal anesthesia and may be present for up to four hours after local administration. The most common areas of trauma are the lower lip and, to a lesser extent, the tongue, followed by the upper lip (Figure 8-13).\nSeveral preventive measures can be followed:\n- Advise the patient and accompanying adult about the possibility of injury if the patient bites, sucks, or chews on  the  lips,  tongue,  and  cheek.  If  not  clearly  forewarned, a parent may accuse the dentist of   creating the resulting damage during the operative session.\n- The sensation created by the local anesthesia will be new to most children. They should be reassured that it  will  go  away  within  an  hour  or  two.  They  also should delay eating and avoid hot drinks until the effects of the anesthesia have totally dissipated.\n- Sedated  children  may  fall  asleep  after  being  discharged  and  cause  damage.

    "context_enriched_content": "Anesthetic Toxicity (Overdose)\nWhile rare in adults, young children are more likely to experience toxic reactions because of their lower weight. Most adverse drug reactions occur within 5-10 minutes of injection. Overdoses of local anesthetics are caused by high blood levels of anesthetic as a result of an inadvertent intravascular injection or repeated injections. Local anesthetic  overdose  results  in  excitation,  followed  by depression of the central nervous system and, to a lesser extent, of the cardiovascular system.\nEarly  subjective  symptoms  of  the  central  nervous system  include  dizziness,  anxiety,  and  confusion,  and may be followed by diplopia, tinnitus, drowsiness, and circumoral numbness or tingling. Objective signs include muscle twitching, tremors, talkativeness, slowed speech, and shivering, followed by overt seizure activity. Unconsciousness and respiratory arrest may occur. The initial cardiovascular system response to local anesthetic toxicity is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. As  blood  plasma  levels  of  the  anesthetic  increase, vasodilatation  occurs,  followed  by  depression  of  the\nmyocardium with a subsequent fall in blood pressure. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest may follow.\nLocal  anesthetic  toxicity  is  preventable  by  following proper injection  technique-i.e.,  aspiration  during  slow injection.  Clinicians  should  know  maximum  recommended  dosages  (MRD)  based  on  weight.  If  lidocaine topical anesthetic is used, it should be factored into the total  administered  dose,  as  it  can  infiltrate  into  the vascular  system.  After  injection,  the  patient  should  be observed for any possible toxic response as early recognition and intervention are the keys to a successful outcome. One  cannot  over-emphasize  the  universal  importance that all dental practitioners treating children should consistently calculate a weight-based MRD of both local anesthetics and sedative agents. Additionally, clinicians should  adjust  downward  the  doses  of  local  anesthetic when  sedating  children  with  drugs  that  are  known  to cause  respiratory  depression.  For  example,  it  has  been well-documented  that  sedation  with  opioids  and  other CNS depressant agents like chloral hydrate may increase the risk of local anesthetic toxicity due to their synergistic CNS depressing effects, especially in children (see Chapter Twelve).  In  addition,  local    anesthetic  toxicity  reactions may be masked by the administration of benzodiazepines during  sedation,  thus  making  it  more  difficult  for  the practitioner to   recognize a local anesthetic overdose. The two most common local anesthetic solutions used in pediatric dentistry are 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine  and  3%  mepivacaine  (used  in  children  when  the vasossodepressor is contraindicated). The maximum dosage  of  both  lidocaine  and  mepivacaine  is  2.0 mg/lb (4.4  mg/kg) and the maximum total dosage is 300 mg.\nReferring to Table 8.1, it is possible to approximate the maximum recommended dosage and amount of local anesthetic agents for patients of specific weight and type of  anesthetic.  For  example:  To  calculate  the  maximum amount of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and the number of cartridges that can be safely administered to a 30-pound patient, the clinician would perform the following calculations.\nTable 8-1.

The patient's medical history included obstructive sleep apnea, and he was reported as being congested on the day he presented for dental treatment. Steve was placed in a papoose board and was administered three   cartridges of 2% lidocaine (108 mg, 6.6 mg/kg) within three   minutes. After  a  few  minutes,  the  child  appeared  to  fall  asleep. Within fifteen minutes of beginning treatment, the dental assistant noticed that the patient's tongue was purple. He was  unwrapped  from  the  papoose.  The  patient's  vital signs were checked and there was no detectable pulse or breathing.  CPR  was  started  and  the  paramedics  were called. Paramedics arrived within four minutes of the call and  assumed  the  resuscitative  efforts. The  patient  was intubated, after which a volume of thick, mucous-filled fluid  was  suctioned  from  his  airway.  When  the  paramedics' efforts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful, the child was transported to the local children's hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nCase 8.5, Discussion : Tragically, unlike the other cases presented  in  this  chapter,  this  case  is  an  accurate description of an actual overdose that occurred. It was presented  as a closed  malpractice  insurance  claim (Chicka et al. 2012). One unexpected finding was that 41%  of claims involved the administration of an overdose of a local anesthetic agent, ranging from 118% to  356%  of  the  MRD.  The  widespread  use  of  local anesthesia in dentistry is generally very safe  and effective.  Serious  adverse  reactions  involving    children are usually the result of dose-dependent toxicity reactions. The study's findings suggest that there continues to be local anesthetic overdoses, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in children.\nThe  child  in  this  case  received  one  cartridge  more than he should have:\n```\n2.0 36 72mgs, MaximumTotalDosage mg mg/cartridge × = ÷ ( )\n```\n- Maximum ca = rtridges, 72 36=2cartridges. ÷"

    "context_enriched_content": "introduction to Pharmacological techniques: a historical Perspective\nGerald Z. Wright\nAri Kupietzky\nThis introduction provides a brief chronologic history of pediatric dental sedation, beginning with the 1970s. It focuses on changes that have occurred in the United States  in  the  last  forty  years,  as  Americans  have led the changes. Knowing what has transpired in the past  helps  to  understand  current  regulations  and practices.\nIn 1998, the American Academy  of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) used the terms minimal, moderate, and deep to categorize sedations (Reference Manual 2010-2011). These are different degrees of central nervous  system  depression,  each  corresponding  to  a level  of  sedation  relaxation.  However,  in  the  first edition of this book, Musselman and McClure (1975) categorized drugs differently. They opined that decisions  concerning  the  type  of  drug  and  the  suitable  route  of  drug  administration  may  be  made,  in part, on the basis of the level of a child's cooperative behavior. They classified sedation as two types: preventive premedication and management   medication. A preventive premedication is used when a child is stressed by the dental situation, but is still communicative. There are different types of behaviors-scared, timid, apprehensive-that could be considered candidates for a preventive medication. Management medication is used for children who are unable to control their  behavior  or  for  those  lacking  in  cooperative ability.  The  dentist  would  find  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  obtain  adequate  radiographs  on  these  children. Verbal communication may have little meaning for them.\nThese sedation categories are rarely used today, but it is sometimes helpful to think of the drug you are about to use in this way. Consider the following case."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 9.1\nJill, age four, was a healthy child requiring four quadrants of dentistry. At the initial examination the child appeared cooperative, but the dentist recognized her apprehension. When the napkin was placed on Jill's chest, a very rapid heartbeat was  felt.  The child's eyes followed every movement of the dental team. She talked incessantly and laughed forcefully, as if trying to camouflage her concern.\nDespite these observations, the dentist elected to treat Jill  with  Behavior Shaping, a non-pharmacologic approach. Performing  dentistry  quadrant  by  quadrant,  the  dentist achieved good patient cooperation at the first and second restorative appointments. At the third visit the child cried at  the  injection  but  eventually  calmed  down. When the time arrived for the fourth appointment, Jill's parent had to forcibly bring her to the office. The child cried continuously and hysterically, refusing the injection.\nCase 9.1,  Discussion : The case illustrates  an  excellent example of when a preventive medication might be used. The child was obviously apprehensive at the first visit, and  her  behavior  changed  from  cooperative  to  highly uncooperative  by  the  fourth  appointment.  If  the  child had received a preventive medication, a more favorable outcome may have resulted. A contemporary example of  a  preventive  medication  is  nitrous  oxide  inhalation analgesia.  Thinking  in  terms  of  the  child's  cooperative behavior is a useful way of guiding drug selection.\nIn 1975, numerous sedation agents were being used in private  practices  and  teaching  venues.  To  determine\nwhich sedation agents to include in the original edition of this book, a survey of members of the American Board of  Pedodontics  (now AAPD)  was  undertaken  (Wright and McAulay 1973) to determine: (1) which drugs were used  by  the  members,  and  (2)  what  the  common methods  of  drug  administration  were.  The  survey concluded that  hydroxyzine  (Atarax,  Vistaril)  was  the most popular sedating agent when used alone.\nHydroxyzine, a minimal sedation agent, can serve as an  excellent  preventive  medication.  It  is  best  used  for children three to six years of age and those who are timid, apprehensive, or highly anxious. However, the drug by itself  likely  will  not  be  sufficient.  Success  in  patient management  requires  both  pharmacological  and  nonpharmacological  techniques; the individual dentist's training  and  experience  makes  the  difference  in  choice and efficacy of techniques employed (Phero, 1993). This is  especially  true  when  using  a  minimal  or  preventive medication. Indeed, since a patient's awareness may be somewhat dulled, greater emphasis is placed on using a very  good  non-pharmacologic  approach.  As  the  sole sedating  agent,  hydroxyzine  has  limited  success  with older children, but nowadays  it is often used in combination with other agents. When used with nitrous oxide, its antiemetic effect can be advantageous.\nChloral  hydrate  was  the  next  most  popular  drug when  used  alone,  and  it  was  usually  employed  as  a management  medication.  In  1975,  pediatric  dentists were still trying to determine the proper dosage . There was little agreement. Maximum suggested dosages for a four-year-old child ranged from 750 mg to 1000 mg (Sim 1975) and sometimes as high as 1250 mg (Smith 1977). While historically there was confusion as to the correct dosage, it did not prevent its use, and deep sedations often  were  obtained  with  the  limited  monitoring  that was available at that time. Chloral hydrate is no longer manufactured commercially in the United States, but it remains available at local pharmacies and in other countries. For this reason, it has been included in this book.\nWhen it came to drugs used in combination, promethazine (Phenergan) and meperidine (Demerol) were the most popular. When children were 'strongly apprehensive,' the combination of Phenergan and Demerol were used  widely  as  a  management  medication.  The  1975 survey reported that 35% of ABPD members administered  medication  intramuscularly.  The  injections  were likely for meperidine."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 9.1\nThe Wright and McAulay survey also found that only 44% of pediatric dentists were using nitrous oxide at the time. In 1996, Wilson reported that 89% of AAPD members were using nitrous oxide, doubling its usage over a span  of  twenty  years.  Similar  trends  are  revealed  by consecutive surveys undertaken by Houpt (1985, 1993, 2002) as part of the Project on Usage of Sedative Agents by Pediatric Dentists (USAP). Because nitrous oxideoxygen inhalation analgesia-is now highly popular, an expanded chapter has been devoted to its application in pediatric dentistry.\nIn 1973, the survey revealed that slightly more than 10% of pediatric dentists administered drugs submucosally.  The  majority  of  pediatric  dentists  administered Nisentil (alphaprodine HCl) in this way. The drug was synthesized by Ziering and Lee in 1947 and was used by physicians in obstetrics  for  many  years.  Although Nisentil is not used in dental practice today, it has great historical importance, as its use led to major changes in pediatric dental sedation practices.\nPediatric dentists used Nisentil to control the behavior of  difficult  child  patients,  particularly  those  three  to  six years of age. The drug acted rapidly, with a peak effect of five to ten minutes. It was similar to Demerol, but 2.5 times more potent. Its side effects included respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting. Like Demerol, its effects could be reversed with a narcotic antagonist. In 1980, Nisentil was  suddenly  withdrawn  by  the  manufacturer  Roche Laboratories, a division of Hoffman-LaRoche.\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) voiced its concern to Roche Laboratories about the sudden withdrawal of Nisentil. Many pediatric dentists were outraged, as they relied on the drug to manage  their  patients.  To  deal  with  the  Nisentil  issue,  a symposium was held in Los Angeles in 1981 and its proceedings were published in a special issue of Pediatric Dentistry the following year. Chen (1982), representing Roche Laboratories, cited four cases of adverse experiences with the drug. Children twenty-eight months to four  years  died  or  suffered  cerebral  damage  due  to anoxia. Key information extracted from 7,372 cases gathered from the files of twelve dentists using Nisentil was as follows: patients ranged from two to twelve years of age, drug efficacy was rated between 2.8 and 2.9 (3 max), dosage was 5-15 mg in most cases, and severe adverse reactions occurred in 8/7,372 cases.\nAubuchon (1982) also presented an important report at  the  symposium.  Basing  his  findings  on  2,911  questionnaires, his main conclusions were: a narcotic sedative technique was the most popular means of sedating pediatric  patients,  narcotic  sedations  had  an  adverse risk reaction of 1:5,000 as compared to a risk of 1:20,00030,000  for  non-narcotic  agents,  and  an  alphaprodine sedation is as safe or safer than a meperidine sedation. Creedon (1982) and Troutman and Renzi (1982), citing their  experiences  and  case  reports,  provided  further support for the use of Nisentil. The symposium panel concluded that although there were other drugs available for pediatric dental sedation, none were as effective as  Nisentil.  Two  outcomes  of  the  symposium  were that:  (1)  better  education  was  needed for practitioners\nchoosing  to  use  sedation  medication,  and  (2)  there needed to be a set of guidelines to establish a basic standard of care for these procedures. Until that time there were no formal sedation guidelines."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 9.1\nShortly  thereafter,  the  AAPD  Board  of  Directors appointed  an  ad  hoc  committee  charged  specifically with developing and writing the guidelines. The committee  consisted  of  appointed  members  from  the AAPD  and  representatives  from  American  Society  of Dentistry for Children, American Academy of Pediatrics, and  Roche  Laboratories.  In  1983,  the  committee  presented the guidelines to the AAPD membership, leading to controversy and fury. Many objected to the content of the  guidelines-they  viewed  them  as  possible  regulation  of  their  practices-and  serious  opposition  was heard.  Subsequently,  the  guidelines  underwent  further changes  and  presentations  at  AAPD  annual  meetings. Input was also obtained from the Academy of Pediatrics section on Anesthesiology, the American Dental Society of Anesthesiology, and the American Association of Oral and  Maxillofacial  Surgery.  In  the  end,  the  guidelines were the result of a consensus of opinions, and the final document was entitled 'Guidelines for the Elective Use of  Conscious  Sedation,  Deep  Sedation  and  General Anesthesia.' Following a few minor changes at the behest of  the American Academy of Pediatrics, the guidelines were jointly published in the July 1985 issue of Pediatrics and  in  the  December  1985  issue  of Pediatric  Dentistry . Those guidelines are the basis for guides today. It is interesting to reflect upon this period of time. If Nisentil had not been withdrawn, how long would it have taken for pediatric dentistry to have sedation guidelines?\nThe guidelines focused on details which theoretically act to protect and promote the welfare of children who required  sedation.  From  the  practitioner's  viewpoint, the  guidelines  could  be  perceived  as  mediating  major change in practice. For instance, maintaining time-based records of sedation may be misconstrued as a significant logistical problem.\n- Who  in  the  operatory  is  to  be  trained  to  record physiological parameters?\n- What should be on the data gathering form?\n- When  is  it  really  necessary  to  record  monitored parameters?\n- What do the guidelines offer in providing guidance to these questions?\nSedation  guidelines  are  not  static:  they  need  to  be dynamic, and they require modification on a periodic basis. Fortunately, the AAPD had the foresight to recognize the potential need for modification, and in 1992 the subcommittee  on  sedation  convened  to  evaluate  all aspects of the guidelines. They were revised further in 1996, 2000, 2005, 2008, and 2011. Guidelines also have to be adjusted to satisfy the laws of various states, provinces, or nations.\nWhile  sedation  usage  was  increasing,  it  was  very difficult to determine the effectiveness of the guidelines. Consequently,  Davis  (1988)  surveyed  Diplomates  of the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD). He found  that  the  two  most  important  reasons  for  the increase in sedation usage were that (1) 54% of pediatric dentists claimed they now treated more difficult patients,  and  (2)  many  (32%)  felt  the  need  to  provide more efficient care due to economic pressures. Interestingly,  12%  felt  that  they  were  now  better  prepared to use conscious sedation and 39% decreased their sedation  usage  because  of  the  difficulty  in  complying with the AAPD guidelines. The latter two findings suggested  that  the  guidelines  were  beginning  to  have  a positive effect.\nCompliance  with  the  guidelines  was  slow.  Houpt (1993) found that practitioners who used sedation monitored their patients in a variety of ways. Most evaluated by the color of their patient's appearance, but only 54% used a precordial stethoscope and only a third of practitioners took blood pressure. On the other hand, pulse rate was taken by 83%, respiration was monitored by 80%, and 69% used a pulse oximeter. What was difficult to determine in this report was whether the monitoring  was  appropriate  for  the  types  of  sedation administered."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 9.1\nSix years after the guidelines were published, further need  for  changes  was  evident  based  upon  survey responses  from  95%  of  pediatric  dentistry  program directors.  A  survey  report  by  Wilson  (2001)  found an  increase  in  conscious  sedation  lecture  hours,  as compared  to  earlier data. It was  also found  that midazolam was the most frequently used sedative and there  was  an  increase  in  emergency  preparedness.  In some cases there were no changes. Oral administration remained the predominant route and, importantly, the precordial stethoscope, pulse oximeter, and blood pressure cuff were the most commonly used monitors. The  anticipated  sedation  depth  and  sedation  agents were key factors in choosing these monitors.\nWhile  the  use  of  sedation  to  treat  children  was increasing, not everyone in the 1990s was in favor of the increase.  Griffin  and  Schneiderman  (1992)  questioned the need to sedate and suggested that before sedating, pediatric dentists should consider:\n- the urgency of treatment.\n- deferral of treatment until the use of nonpharmacologic techniques is appropriate.\n- weighing the benefit versus the risk.\nStudying and adhering to guidelines is critical-they assist  clinicians  to  deliver  safe  sedation  to  their  child\npatients. A recent (and disturbing) report (Chicka 2012) of seventeen closed malpractice cases revealed that in all cases, guidelines were not observed. Overdoses and instances  of  inadequate  monitoring  were  found  in anesthesia cases for pediatric dental patients, and nine cases  resulted  in  death  or  permanent  brain  damage. While there will undoubtedly always be untoward incidents such as these, there is no excuse for disregarding the guidelines.\nThe  foregoing  is  a  brief  summary  of  the  history  of pediatric sedation. It reveals how the area of pediatric dental  sedation  has  changed. And  it  is  still  changing. Considering recent surveys, Johnson et al. (2012) reported change. From 1,219 survey returns, they found that 63% of the respondents practiced conscious sedation  primarily  to  help  provide  care  for  patients  who were difficult to manage. That is quite different than earlier  findings  that  showed  economics  to  be  one  of  the prime reasons for sedation. Those who did not practice conscious sedation gave exposure to liability as the main reason. Years ago, that was not a major consideration. Wilson  and  Nathan  (2011)  followed  up  on  the  2001 survey of program directors. They found varying experiences in training programs, and they concluded that there was a need to strengthen competencies in sedation practices  in  academic  programs.  In  earlier  years  there was  no  mention  of  competencies.  Thus,  sedation  in pediatric  dentistry  is  continually  changing.  That  challenges the practitioner to keep up with the changes.\nThe  shifts in sedation practices within  pediatric dentistry  reflect  the  many  changes  occurring  within modern society. Traditionally, widely acceptable behavior management techniques such as tell-show-do (TSD) and other,  more  aversive  methods  were  used  by  pediatric dentists.  However,  due  to  evolving  societal  norms, their use is slowly being phased out. In May 2006, the AAPD eliminated the hand-over-mouth exercise (HOM) technique from  its clinical guidelines on behavior management. Pediatric dentists are also hesitant to use other techniques. Today, many parents refuse to be separated from their child, and others will not allow voice control, stating, 'We never raise our voices to our children, why should we allow you to do so?'"

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 9.1\nWithout  the  ability  to  use  these  time-proven  techniques,  pediatric  dentists  will  often  find  their  hands tied when confronting a defiant, uncooperative and/or over-indulged  child  who  is  perhaps  accompanied  by over-protective parents. Casamassimo  et  al. (2002) reported the effects of changing parenting styles on dental practices in the United States. The majority of pediatric dentists (92%) indicated that parenting style changes were probably (54%) or definitely (38%) responsible for changes in patient management. Respondents  felt  that  parenting  styles  had  changed because  parents  were  less  willing  to  set  limits,  less willing to use physical discipline, unsure of their roles as parents, too busy to spend time with their children, and  too  self-absorbed  or  materialistic.  Practitioners reported using much less assertive behavior management techniques due to these changes. Adair (2004) also found that the great majority of practitioners believed that parenting styles had changed during their years in practice, and that these changes may have contributed to an increase  in  behavior  management  problems  in  the dental setting. Thus, a trend within the profession is to use sedation and general anesthesia more frequently as a means of treating many young children in the dental office that in previous years may have been successfully treated  non-pharmacologically.  Anesthesiologists  also have detected  this  change.  Olabi's  survey  (2012)  concluded  that  the  use  of  dental  anesthesiologists  for administration of deep sedation and general anesthesia appears  to  be  an  emerging  trend  in  pediatric  dental practice. It is amazing that within such a relatively short period of time, the acceptance of general anesthesia by parents has drastically changed: in 1991 (Lawrence et al. 1991)  it  was  rated  as  being  the  least  acceptable  of  all techniques, and in 2005 (Eaton et al. 2005) it was ranked as the third-most acceptable. To expect today's dentist to  achieve  the  administration  of  uncompromised  and proper  dental  treatment  without  the  use  of  aversive patient management or pharmacotherapy techniques is unrealistic.  This  is  the  rationale  that  prompted  the decision  to  include  chapters  describing  sedation  and general anesthesia techniques."

    "context_enriched_content": "introduction\nOnly a few short decades have witnessed a multitude of significant changes associated with the pharmacological management of children for dental and medical procedures. As shown in the previous chapter, there are many possible  reasons  for  the  change.  Importantly,  these include the development and implementation of sedation guidelines by professional groups and the unpredictable but constantly evolving professional and societal  influences  affecting  behavioral  management techniques, including sedation practices. There seems to be a tendency, however, for pediatric dentists to practice pharmacological  management  of  children  in  a  similar vein to that in which they were trained (Houpt 2002). Thus, the practice of sedation in the United States has likely retained much from the past.\nOne  aspect  of  pharmacological  management  that remains constant is the quest for the 'magic bullet.' The 'magic bullet' is thought of as a single sedative agent or concoction of sedative agents which, when given to a child patient, will: a) ensure that the child is peaceful in demeanor and responds favorably during the procedure, b)  harbors  enough  working  memory  to  retain  the impression of a pleasant experience at the dental office, c) is minimally affected by invasive dental interventions from physiological, behavioral, and emotional perspectives, and d) is always safe in the hands of the clinician. So far, the only 'magic bullet' that comes close but does not fully satisfy this idyllic state is that of general anesthesia. One might predict that the future will see such a 'magic bullet,' but not in the same heuristic conceptualization that we currently embrace. Rather, it may involve the  use  of  some  selective,  reversible  effect  on  various neuroanatomical loci of the brain using an, as yet, undiscovered  psychopharmacological  concoction  or  other interventional procedure."

    "context_enriched_content": "sedation and Pediatric Dentistry\nOne  popular  method  used  today  in  clinical  care  of patients  who  experience  fear,  anxiety,  and/or  pain  is pharmacological intervention. In fact, sedation of children is a very common and accepted modality of patient management during potentially painful procedures. Its popularity is due, in part, to its effective and efficient ability to overcome in variable degrees the mental and emotional  anguish  and  behavioral  expressions  of  the patient who otherwise is unable to provide satisfactory personal management of the distressing situation.\nThe process and need for safety in performing sedation during  dental  procedures  involves  several  factors  that are directed toward positive general outcomes. Some of these factors can be seen in Table 10-1. Clinicians must have a strong cognitive understanding of clinical expertise in, and respect for each of these factors, often reflected in the concept of professional competency. Unfortunately, little is currently known about practitioner competency surrounding the knowledge of and adherence to these factors,  either  in  the  educational  or  practice  communities. Indirectly, information through surveys over the decades has suggested that many practitioners perform sedations on a regular basis (Houpt 1989, 1993, 2002), but documented information of the details of the sedations and  even  their  effectiveness  are  mostly  non-existent. Nonetheless, several important factors, which the dentist should have gleaned through formal training and experience, are discussed briefly in the following sections."

Major factors and their considerations in performing sedations.\n\nChild characteristics, Considerations = Age, cognition, temperament, style of coping, parent-child relationship.

Emergency prevention and management, Considerations = Training, recognition, and interventional abilities\narriving at a safe and  successful clinical  outcome (see  Chapter Two). Usually, children under three years of age are not easily managed during stressful or painful procedures  using  behavioral interactive techniques. The likelihood that such techniques will become more successful  increases  once  the  youngster  has  a  better comprehension and mastery of speech, symbolic manipulations, and coping strategies. Thus, pharmacological management  of  the  child  who  is  under  three  years becomes  a  more  promising  and  rational  approach  in managing behavior, assuming the depth of the sedation is sufficient to overcome the child's natural instincts of fight  or  flight  during  the  procedure.  Generally,  deep sedation (DS) or general anesthesia (GA) is needed, but they carry a greater risk for the child and clinical team.\nChildren cope with varying degrees of success during challenging clinical situations. There are few studies in dentistry investigating cognitive coping strategies, parental or staff-assisted interventions (e.g., distraction or  breathing  exercises),  or  other  mechanisms  used  to cope  with  acute  or  chronic  pain  and  perceived  stress. However, interventional studies designed to minimize anxiety,  stress,  and  pain  in  non-dental  settings  have been investigated by others. For convenience, they are listed  with  the  references  at  the  end  of  the  chapter. Investigations  into  how  children  cope  with  stressful situations  potentially  involving  pain  have  led  to  such concepts as information-seeking and informationlimiting individuals (Fortier et al. 2009). In other words, some  children  do  better  when  told  about  details  of  a procedure that they will undergo, whereas others use different techniques, including  limiting  information about the procedure.\nTemperament may be defined as how a child typically responds to a novel environment as well as the child's basic  daily  expression  pattern  in  a  host  of  solitary  and social situations. It was initially described in relation to the  clinical  environment  in  the  1960s  by  Thomas  and\nTable 10-2. Domains of temperament.\n\nSensitivity Approachability Adaptability Mood Distractibility Activity Regularity Intensity Persistence, Characteristic = threshold level for change in environment initial response to new settings response over time to new settings tendency toward happy or unhappy attitude tendency to be sidetracked daily amount of energy expended predictability in daily routine amount of energy in response to setting ability to stick to task\nChess (1963). As such, temperament has received considerable attention in explaining some behaviors associated with various settings (Lopez et al. 2008; Fortier et al. 2010; Lee  and  White-Traut  1996).  Several  characteristics  supporting differences in temperament have been described (Lochary et al. 1993) and can be seen in Table 10-2."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Child\nTemperamental characteristics of children are thought to  be  related  to  child  behavior  in  clinical  situations (Caldwell-Andrews  and  Kain  2006;  Tripi  et  al.  2004). Interestingly, there is a significant amount of information concerning  the  contribution  of  child  temperament  to behaviors witnessed in the dental environment (Arnrup et  al.  2003; Arnrup  et  al.  2007;  Klingberg  and  Broberg 1998, 2007) Children can generally be divided into three groups: a) easy-those are very interactive, friendly, and easily managed; b) slow-to-warm up-those who generally do well with appropriate guidance but need some time  to  overcome  minor  anxieties;  and  c)    difficultthose who are withdrawn and display overt disruptive behaviors with little provocation (Lochary et al. 1993). The results of some studies suggest that shy children in the  dental  setting  express  more  distress  and  negative behaviors in response to dental procedures (Jensen and Stjernqvist  2002;  Quinonez  et  al.  1997),  whereas  those\nwho are  adaptable  and  approachable  exhibit  less  disruptive  and  more  appropriate  interactive  behaviors (Lochary  et  al.  1993;  Radis  and  Wi  1994).  A  clinician should always be cognizant of children's behaviors preoperatively  in  hopes  of  finding  clues  that  may  aid  in anticipating interactions with the child once dental procedures begin. For instance, a concerted effort should be made to observe the interaction of the dental staff with children during initial introductions and exchanges of pleasantries, patient weighing, and introduction to the office in general and the clinical operatory in particular. These  interactions  can  help  to  predict  behavior  and anticipate potential behavior management strategies.\nA parent's demeanor, body language, concerns, desires, anxieties, and opinions are also important considerations. Parents usually have beliefs and value systems that tend to fit their generation, lifestyle, and life experiences.  It  is  appropriate  for  the  practitioner  to ascertain  the  parent's  opinion  in  discussing  behavior management possibilities.\nThere  is  some  evidence  suggesting  that  parenting skills have changed over recent decades and that these changes influence how children tend to respond in the dental environment, as well as in other social settings (Casamassimo  et  al.  2002;  Schorr  2003).  Practitioners report that children tend to cry and are more difficult to manage  than  in  the  past.  Furthermore,  some  view today's  parents,  compared  to  recent  generations,  as more liberal in rearing their children. As an extension of that view, many believe that this less-involved parenting style  is  a  detrimental  trend  in  that  parents  fail  to  set limits and are less involved in guiding their children in psychosocial and socialization processes. Even  the concept  of  the  family  is  different  than  it  was  when this  textbook  was  initially  written  (see  Chapter  Four). As a newer  generation of professionals transition into providing care, their attitudes, opinions, and orien- tations toward delivery of care may change, reflecting similar sentiments of parents of their age. It will remain speculative as to what management technologies may prevail in the future. But it is possible, based on societal trends today, that a greater reliance on pharmacological management will predominate in managing children for medical and dental procedures."

    "context_enriched_content": "Patient Assessment\nOne of the most important and comprehensive aspects in the decision to use pharmacological agents in aiding the management of the child is that of patient assessment. Patient  assessment  includes  a  detailed  review  of  the medical history and major physiological systems (e.g., cardiovascular) and performing a physical assessment of the child, focusing on auscultation of the chest and heart,  viewing  the  upper  airway  structures  including tonsils,  ascertaining  an  impression  of  the  patient's behavior and temperament, and determining the patient's amount of dental needs. Medical consults following the initial review of the patient's conditions are also a part of this process.\nBy performing these preliminary procedures, one is able  to  determine  the  physical  risk  and  status  of  the patient in undergoing the sedation and dental procedure, the drug(s) and dose(s) selected, and possibly an impression of the likelihood of a successful outcome. A similar process  occurs  when  assessing  a  patient  for  general anesthesia, with the outcome being a physical risk category assigned to the patient. The standard physical risk categories used in medical and dental care are those of the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiology  (i.e.,  ASA classifications) and can be seen in Table 10-3.\nThe  review  of  systems  and  medical  history  implies asking appropriate questions and, if anything other than 'normal'  arises,  follow-up  queries  to  determine  the\nTable 10-3. American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical risk categories.\n\nI, Patient Status = A normal, healthy patient.. I, Comment = No organic, physiologic, or psychiatric disturbance, healthy with good exercise tolerance. II, Patient Status = A patient with mild systemic disease.. II, Comment = No functional limitations, has a well-controlled disease of one body system. III, Patient Status = A patient with severe systemic disease.. III, Comment = Some functional limitation, has a controlled disease of more than one body system or one major system, no immediate danger of death. IV, Patient Status = A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life.. IV, Comment = Has at least one severe disease that is poorly controlled or at end stage. V, Patient Status = A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation..

If  there  is  or  has  been  a  problem  with  a system, a consult with the patient's primary care physician is often advisable.\nAuscultation  of  the  chest  using  a  stethoscope  is needed to confirm that the intrathoracic airway is clear and not congested or indicative of other abnormalities (e.g.,  asthmatic  wheezing). Typically, placement of the bell on the various fields of the chest and back is done. In  preschoolers,  another  good  location  to  hear  breath sounds in under the arm pit and lateral border of the chest. The primary goal in listening to the heart is determining if there is a regular rate and rhythm (e.g., sinus rhythm). If there is anything unusual or different from a typical 'lub-dub' of each cardiac cycle, or if any other sound is heard, a consult with the child's physician is usually recommended. Sites can be found on the Internet allowing  one  to  hear  differences  between  normal  and abnormal  respiratory  and  cardiac  sounds.  A  visit  to those  websites  is  highly  recommended.  Listen  to  the sounds to gain a basic appreciation of what is normal and abnormal."

    "context_enriched_content": "Patient Assessment\nThe size of the tonsils is very important in appreciating the amount of airway space that they occupy between the anterior  and  posterior  pillars  separating  the oral  from  the  pharyngeal  portion  of  the  oropharynx (Figure 10-1). Strong consideration of the risk of large tonsil size is imperative, especially if the likelihood that unconsciousness  may  occur  during  sedation.  Tonsils greater than 50% of the airway diameter are usually contraindicated  with  drugs  like  chloral  hydrate.  Chloral hydrate may increase the probability of airway blockage due to relaxation of the tongue muscles, which, due to gravity  in  a  supine  patient,  fall  backward  against  soft tissue. A very important question that should always be asked of the parent is whether the child snores during sleep. The likelihood of snoring increases as the size of the tonsils increase.\nIt is rare that one cannot visualize the tonsils and transitional aspects of the portion of the oropharynx. If the child  is  fairly  cooperative,  one  may  ask  them  to  point their chin toward the ceiling while in a supine position, open as wide as possible, and say a soft 'ahhh.' The clinician  seated  directly  behind  the  patient  with  good lighting should be able to judge the size of the tonsils and how much of the patent space they occupy. If a child is uncooperative, the following technique can be used to visualize the tonsils. A mouth mirror or tongue blade can be  placed  on  the  posturing  tongue  and  slowly  moved distally until the gag reflex is triggered. The clinician has to quickly observe  the tonsil size during  the  gag movement, where the tonsils and soft tissue collect in the center of the airway space and move slightly cephalad.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure  10-1. Tonsil  size  is  very  important  in  appreciating  the  amount  of airway  space  that  they  occupy  between  the  anterior  and  posterior  pillars separating  the  oral  from  the  pharyngeal  portion  of  the  oropharynx:  visible tonsils of average size (a) versus enlarged tonsils which may result in airway blockage (b).\nThe patient will not vomit, but the clinician has to be prepared to observe the tissues during this quick reflex. A second gag attempt is not recommended.\nFinally,  an  assessment  of  the  child's  dental  needs  is critical in terms of the number of teeth or quadrants of dentistry requiring treatment, the technical challenge of the  procedures,  and  the  degree  of  immobility  needed for  the  type  of  procedures  anticipated.  These,  along with the child's temperament, are important variables in deciding the selection of agents and their doses prior to preparing the sedation 'cocktail.' For instance, an ultrashort  procedure  such  as  extraction  of  the  maxillary primary incisors may only require a moderate dose of midazolam. Midazolam has a rapid onset but a short duration of action, whereas two or more quadrants of dental restorations may require a triple combination of drugs such as low dose chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine. This combination affords the dentist a\nlonger working time. Those who do not vary the drug regimens or doses are likely to have a lower rate of successful sedations than those who have the training and skills associated with various drug regimens."

Another benefit of relying on a regular and standardized procedural sequence is that it allows the incorporation and synchronization of other staff or colleagues as collaborators in safeguarding patient welfare.\nAs a team, a set of checks throughout the process diminishes errors of omission, overt forgetfulness, and probabilities  of  sequential  flaws.  A  sense  of  teamwork  will evolve and can be strengthened by regular reviews and application  of  risk  management  principles,  with  the goal of continual quality improvement.\nThere are key steps within a protocol that should be highlighted  for  emphasis  in  guaranteeing  the  best  possible outcome for the patient. They are important because they  increase  favorable  interactions  between  controlled and  uncontrolled  factors  (e.g.,  dental  procedure  versus child  temperament,  respectively),  provide  primary  and secondary defenses against procedural hazards, and communicate a strong feeling of competency in performing professional  duties.

Several  monitors  are  used  in clinical dentistry, and they can be broadly categorized as electronic and non-electronic (e.g., pulse oximeter and precordial stethoscope, respectively). Some of the electronic monitors measure the same parameter as nonelectronic monitors (e.g., heart rate). Automated blood pressure machines can determine the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as an isolated event or in repeated, regularly  timed  intervals.  Likewise,  a  manual  blood pressure  cuff  can  determine  the  same  parameters  of blood pressure, but usually requires another tool (i.e., stethoscope)  and  a  clinician's  sense  of  hearing  and sound discrimination."

They  are  particularly useful for monitoring airway and heart sounds during sedation.  Optimizing  and  highlighting  the  specific sound  of  either  the  airway  or  the  heart  is  greatly dependent on the placement of the stethoscope's bell on the chest wall.\nTo  maximize  airway  versus  heart  sounds,  one  can imagine  a  triangle  on  a  child's  chest with  a  line connecting the two nipples, representing the base of the triangle (see Figure 10-2). The right and left sides of the triangle  run  from  the  corresponding  right  and  left nipple to the notch or soft depression on the neck, just superior to the manubrium bone of the chest cage. In a supine patient, placement of the stethoscope bell at the notch will cause breathing sounds to be loud and dominant, compared to the faint sounds of the heart. As the stethoscope  bell  is  moved  along  the  imaginary  line connecting  the  notch  to  the  left  nipple,  the  breathing sounds fade and the heart sounds begin to dominate. Airway sounds are more important during sedation, as they transmit information on the function and patency of  the  upper  airway,  as  well  as  secondary  anatomical structures  and  sounds  (e.g.,  esophagus  and  vomiting, respectively). Thus, during sedations, the bell should be placed  toward  the  apex  of  the  triangle.  It  should  be gently  but  firmly  attached  to  the  body  either  with adhesive tape or 3M Double-Stick Discs® (3M Medical Device Division, St. Paul, MN).\nFigure 10-2. Photograph showing a triangle on the chest and the placement of the stethoscope bell for maximizing airway sounds.\nWhen  listening  through  a  stethoscope,  competing sounds come from various sources, including handpiece noise,  a  metal  rubber  dam  frame  touching  the  stethoscope bell and conducting sounds when the handpiece contacts the frame, and ambient room noise (e.g., talking or  music).  These  sounds  can  often  be  comparatively loud and drown out the airway sounds, increasing the need for additional monitoring."

    "context_enriched_content": "Blood Pressure Cuffs\nThe use of blood pressure cuffs (BPCs) has a long history in medicine and dentistry. BPCs can be used manually or electronically. An inflatable bladder is embedded in the manual  BPC.  There  is  a  pressure  gauge  inside  the bladder, as well as a valve-controlled bulb, which inflates and deflates the bladder, connected to the cuff by a flexible rubber tube. Manual use of a BPC may be very helpful in emergency situations to gain a quick insight into the  approximate  systolic  pressure  of  the  patient.  For example, a very quick but imprecise measure of systolic blood pressure can be obtained by inflating the cuff with a valve-controlled bulb, and then rapidly decreasing the pressure  in  the  cuff  until  the  needle,  which  had  been traveling  in  at  a  smooth,  constant  rate  from  higher  to lower  pressures,  begins  to  'bounce.'  This  technique gives the clinician a rapid means of determining the general range of systolic pressure.\nAutomated BPCs indirectly indicate the systolic and diastolic  blood  pressures,  as  well  as  the  heart  rate  at discrete but modifiable intervals. The automated BPCs also  use  a  bladder-  and  transducer-embedded  cuff,  a rubber  tube  connecting  the  cuff  to  the  frame  of  the blood pressure apparatus, which contains a pump and microchip to control the inflation and deflation of the\ncuff  as  well  as  perform  various  blood  pressure  and heart rate parameters.\nWith many automated units, a typical cycle of determining blood pressure involves periods of inflation and deflation of the cuff to obtain blood pressure parameters and variable inactive periods of time between measurements. A cycle for sampling blood pressure can be varied over  a  wide  range  of  time  periods  (e.g.,  every  3-90 minutes).\nFunctionally,  the  bladder  is  inflated  over  a  few  seconds to a pressure that essentially occludes blood flow in arteries. Normally, the initial pressure is internally set close to 150 mm Hg, but if vibrations are detected, the pressure  is  increased  until  such  vibrations  cease.  The bladder  is  then  deflated  in  small  steps  of  pressure change, during which the transducer monitors oscillatory  signals  emanating  from  the  arteries  through  the bladder. When the first increase in the size of oscillatory signals per step of decreasing pressure change is repeatedly detected, the BPC reports this pressure value as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff continues to deflate in pressure  steps  and  the  pulse  pressure  in  the  limb  initially  increases,  then  declines,  until  finally  no  further change  in  oscillatory  signals  is  detected.  The  bladder pressure  at  that  point  represents  the  diastolic  blood pressure.  Control  of  this  cycle  is  done  electronically through an algorithm which also determines and reports mean arterial pressure in some units, which is approximately two-thirds of systolic blood pressure. The pulsating oscillatory signals detected can also be used to calculate heart rate.\nThere are a few factors that can cause artifact information  with  both  manual  and  automated  BPCs, including a) different width-sized cuffs, with oversized cuffs  tending  to  cause  erroneously  low  pressure  readings  and  undersized  cuffs  causing  erroneously  high blood pressure readings; b) air leaks anywhere within the system; and c) patient movement. The latter is clinically significant. Movements or attempts to dislodge the cuff  by  an  uncooperative  child  may  result  in  constant recycling at high pressures. Eventually the inflated, high pressure cuff begins to cause distal pain in the occluded limb.  Under  normal  circumstances,  most  automated BPCs require less than 30 seconds to determine blood pressure.  However,  with  a  struggling  child,  the  prolonged inflation pressure of the cuff (often greater than a minute or so) causes pain and can aggravate disruptive behaviors.\nIn dosages designed to produce minimal and moderate sedation, most sedative agents do not cause significant clinical  changes  in  blood  pressure  in  the  unprovoked, resting  child.  And  in  general,  the  blood  pressure  and heart rate vary with age (the younger the child, the lower the resting blood pressure and the higher the heart rate)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Pulse oximetry\nThe principle of pulse oximetry is based on the red and infrared  light  absorption  characteristics  of  oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Oxygenated and deoxygenated  hemoglobin  absorbs  light  of  different  wavelengths.  Using  a  microchip  processor,  pulse  oximetry takes advantage of the principle that there is a difference in light absorption of the two different states of hemoglobin, depending on the amount of oxygen being carried on the hemoglobin molecule. Hence, the microchip can discern the ratio of the two wavelengths of light and calculate  the  percent  of  oxygen  saturation  (SaO 2 )  of blood flowing within a tissue bed.\nThe primary disadvantage of pulse oximetry is that it measures oxyhemoglobin saturation rather than arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ).  The PaO 2 and the SaO 2 are not linearly related, but rather are related by the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (Figure 10-3).The 'S' shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is important for physiologic uptake and delivery of oxygen in the body. In the lungs, hemoglobin is rapidly and almost totally saturated over a wide range of PaO 2 (the flat portion of the curve), while at the tissues a large amount of oxygen is  unloaded  as  desaturation  occurs  over  a  relatively small drop in PaO 2 (the steep portion of the curve). An understanding  of  the  relationship  between  PaO 2 and SaO 2 is  essential  for  those  using  pulse  oximetry  clinically (Anderson and Vann 1988).\nChanges  in  oxygenation  are  not  detected  until  the PaO 2 falls to the point where oxyhemoglobin desaturation occurs (the 70-80 mm Hg range), where the steep portion  of  the  oxyhemoglobin  dissociation  curve  is\nOxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve\nFigure 10-3. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve reveals the nonlinear relationship between PaO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen in blood) and oxyhemoglobin  saturation  (SaO 2 ).  (Anderson  J.,A., Vann, W.,F .  Jr.  (1988).  Respiratory monitoring  during  pediatric  sedation:  pulse  oximetry  and  capnography. Pediatric Dentistry, 10, 94-101.) Reproduced with permission from AAPD.\nrapidly  approached.  When  one  is  breathing  room  air, the normal PaO 2 is  in  the 90-100  mm Hg range, which corresponds  to  a  SaO 2 of  96-100%.  Because  a  PaO 2 of 60 mm Hg corresponds to a SaO 2 of approximately 90%, the  PaO 2 must  fall  from  approximately  100%  to  90%. Patients  undergoing  dental  sedation  or  general  anesthesia  often  receive  supplemental  oxygen  (with  or without nitrous oxide), thus the PaO 2 may range from 150 to above 600 mm Hg. The PaO 2 must fall drastically before any change will be detected in the SaO 2 .  Large decreases in oxygenation may occur without any change detected by pulse oximetry. Only when the PaO 2 falls to less than 70 mm Hg will a significant desaturation occur and be detected by pulse oximetry. The pulse oximeter will  not  warn  of  downward  trends  in  PaO 2 over  the wide range of oxygen tensions above this level.\nTo  summarize,  when  oxyhemoglobin  desaturation begins to occur, serious respiratory depression may be present. Furthermore, more rapid desaturation may be imminent as the steep portion of the curve is approached. Therefore, during  pediatric sedation,  even  a  small change  in  saturation  (e.g.,  99-96%)  must  be  noted quickly and evaluated before further desaturation occurs."

    "context_enriched_content": "Pulse oximetry\nThe  pulse  oximeter  unit  consists  of  an  oxisensor attached by a lead or cable to the pulse oximetry unit, which houses the electronic motherboard. The oxisensors come in various shapes and attachment modes. In brief,  the  oxisensor  (the  probe  that  attaches  to  the patient) contains two LED diodes and a photodiode; the LED units emit light in the red and infrared wavelengths range  and  the  photodiode  detects  light  transmitted through a tissue bed. Oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared wavelengths of light, allowing more red light to pass through, while deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs  proportionately  more  red  wavelengths  with more infrared transmitted through the tissue.\nAnother unique aspect of the diodes is that they send alternative signals around 450 times per second. Because the tissue bed expands slightly during pulsatile (arterial) periods, the light travels over a slightly longer distance throughout the pulse and the amount of light collected per  unit  time  changes.  Simultaneously,  the  oxisensor determines  the  change  in  light  transmitted  at  a  very high frequency due to the arterial pulse passing through tissue  bed  (plethysmography).  Thus,  pulse  oximeters theoretically measure only arterial saturation of hemoglobin. The oximeter's processor determines the balance between the two detected wavelengths of light at a very high rate, using an algorithmic function, which makes it possible  for  monitors  to  display  a  representation  of pulse pressure waves.\nThe clinician  needs  to  be  aware  that  certain  clinical conditions and situations can cause false signals unrelated to hemoglobin saturation. Any interference with information  processing  of  the  signal  can  produce  an erroneous  reading.  These  are:  motion  artifact;  crying that  may  involve  a  Valsalva's  maneuver  (airway  is momentarily closed while muscular efforts are made to compress  air  in  the  lungs-grunting);  cold  limbs  or tissue bed; cessation of a prolonged crying bout; some nail  polishes;  profound  tissue  pigmentation  in  some black  persons,  some  hemoglobinopathies  (e.g.,  methemoglobinemia); improperly attached oxisensor to tissue bed or re-used oxisensors; or any condition that reduces blood flow into the tissue bed.\nClinically, it is important to attach the oxisensor probe to  accessible,  well-perfused tissue. The toe next to the great toe seems best suited in the young, active toddler. The oxisensor can be wrapped or placed on that toe and the great toe, second (on which the oxisensor is placed), and middle toe secured together as a unit using adhesive tape. It is also wise to tape the oxisensor cable onto the plantar surface of the foot; otherwise its movement can either dislodge of the oxisensor or cause electromagnetic (motion) artifacts. Fingers are also useful sensor sites in the  older  child  or  adult,  but  most  uncooperative  toddlers will tend to remove the oxisensor, especially if they struggle or do not want the probe on their finger. The ear lobe is another convenient site in older children.\nSince  1985,  almost  every  article  on  sedation  of  the pediatric  dental  patient  published  reports  the  use  of pulse oximeters. Generally, most reports indicate oxygen saturation to be very stable during sedations, with only an occasional desaturation episode. Unfortunately, these desaturation  episodes  can  be  erroneously  associated with the sedative agent, including questionable attribution of the agent's purported effects on airway compromise. Other conditions have been shown to account for what appears to be temporary 'desaturations' that are of no clinical significance."

    "context_enriched_content": "Capnography\nCapnography is one of the least understood monitoring techniques  in  dentistry.  When  used  properly,  it  is  the only monitor on the market that indicates some degree of  the  airway  patency.  Capnographs  measure  expired carbon dioxide concentrations. Normal carbon dioxide concentrations in children range from 33 to 40 mm Hg. However, usually it is not the absolute carbon dioxide concentration that is important during lighter stages of sedation, but the fact that some exchange of air can be 'visualized' on the monitor.\nCapnographs can be classified as either main- or sidestream units.  The  main-stream  is  used  with  intubated patients, whereas the side-stream units are appropriate\n- A: Exhalation begins\n- B-C: Plateau = outflow of alveolar gas\n- C: End-tidal CO 2\nFigure 10-4. Capnography produces a waveform by the continuous analysis of respired gas for CO 2 . The presence of the waveform implies exhalation of gases from the lungs. The end-tidal CO 2 (point C) corresponds to alveolar gas which may correlate closely with the PaCO 2 . (Anderson J.A., Vann, W.F . Jr. (1988). Respiratory monitoring during pediatric sedation: pulse oximetry and capnography. Pediatric Dentistry, 10, 94-101.) Reproduced with permission from AAPD.\nfor  sedated,  non-intubated  patients.  For  side-stream units,  air  is  vacuumed  or  sucked  through  a  port  that is  either  inserted  into  the  nostrils  or  placed  in  close approximation  to  the  nostril  or  mouth.  Sucked  air  is delivered  to  a  chamber  inside  the  capnograph,  where the concentration of carbon dioxide can be determined by  infrared  absorption  technology.  The  amount  of infrared absorption in the test chamber is compared to a  standardized  chamber  containing  a  known  amount of  carbon  dioxide.  The  microchip  processor  determines  and  displays  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration. Capnographs can display single  excursions  representing the concentration of expired carbon dioxide during the expiratory cycle of breathing, and some can display trended  data  in  which  each  excursion  is  compressed over time and appears as a single vertical line.\nThe expired carbon dioxide curve is displayed on a capnograph,  as  shown  in  Figure  10-4.  During  normal circumstances, the beginning rise in the curve represents the first portion of gases, including the dead space, exiting the lungs during the initial phases of expiration. As the  expiratory  process  continues,  gases  from  deeper portions of the lungs containing greater concentrations of carbon dioxide exit and the height of the curve rises dramatically at first, then continues at a fairly constant rate.  As  the  expiratory  process  stops  and  inspiration begins, the concentration of carbon dioxide dramatically drops  back  to  baseline.  The  expired  carbon  dioxide concentration displayed on a capnograph represents the greatest  concentration  (i.e.,  the  final  height)  achieved during that expiration (end-tidal CO 2 ). It represents gas coming from the alveoli and has been shown to correlate closely  with  the  PaCO 2 (partial  pressure  of  CO 2 in arterial blood). During normal breathing, that concentration  is  typically  40 mm  Hg  pressure. A  child who is breathing normally but primarily moving expired gas through the mouth tends to have a waveform that is less  square  in  shape,  and  the  height  (and  displayed concentration value of carbon dioxide) is greatly reduced.  Crying  results  in  a  waveform  with  multiple 'blips' whose height is small. The height and shape of the waveform will be affected in various ways, depending on the condition of the patient during monitoring."

Mucous blockage is one possible clinical situation causing the alarm mechanism to indicate an obstruction. Crying is a clinical event that causes most of the expired air to exit via the mouth; thus, the capnograph  will  detected  a  lower  concentration  of expired carbon dioxide (i.e., the majority was shunted through the mouth, leaving proportionately less to be sucked into the port). This phenomenon is also true of predominant mouth breathers. Additionally, many capnographs  can  electronically  filter  out  the  wavelength associated  with  nitrous  oxide  absorption;  hence,  the sampling tube can be placed under a nitrous hood."

Information on the type of documentation that is needed can be found in sedation guidelines. For example, written and signed informed consent documents should be a part of the patient's record. Also important are consultation documents, pre- and post-operative instructions for parents, detailed progress notes of the procedure, and a time-based record of the sedation. The  American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's website (www.aapd. org) has a sedation record that is detailed and consistent with  all  requirements  of  the  sedation  guidelines.

There is, therefore, considerable variability among training programs, despite advocacy for improving and somewhat standardizing  sedation  training  (Wilson  and  Nathan 2011). Likewise, although state boards of dentistry regulate sedation practices, the degree of consistency among the states' rules and regulations are variable. Nonetheless,  recent  language  changes  in  CODA  standards  for  advanced  programs  in  Pediatric  Dentistry reflect increased experiences for trainees, but not necessarily the scope and quality of such experiences.

Since the first publication of sedation guidelines for children and dentistry in 1985, there have been several revisions. The latest revision of the sedation guidelines, entitled 'Guidelines for Monitoring and Management  of  Pediatric  Patients  During  and  After Sedation  for  Diagnostic  and  Therapeutic  Procedures,' was  published  jointly  by  the  American  Academy  of Pediatrics and the  American  Academy  of  Pediatric Dentistry (2006).\nThe current guidelines are designed for any medical or  dental  procedures involving sedation and children, regardless of the setting. The well-referenced guidelines address prominent issues surrounding sedation of children and can best be summarized in the abstract of the guidelines, which states:\nThe safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic  approach  that  includes  the  following:  no administration of sedating medication without the safety  net  of  medical  supervision,  careful  presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications, appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure, a focused airway examination for large tonsils  or  anatomic  airway  abnormalities  that  might increase  the  potential  for  airway  obstruction,  a  clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the medications used for sedation as well  as  an  appreciation  for  drug  interactions,  appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient, age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access, appropriate medications and reversal agents, sufficient numbers of people to both carry out the procedure and monitor the patient, appropriate physiologic monitoring during  and  after  the  procedure,  a  properly  equipped and staffed recovery area, recovery to pre-sedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical supervision, and appropriate discharge instructions.\nOne of the key concepts of safety in the guidelines is that of 'rescue.' Rescue is defined as the necessary skills of a practitioner  to  a)  recognize  various  levels  of  sedation and b) provide appropriate cardiopulmonary support. Furthermore, rescue interventions require specific training  and  skills.  An  important  skill  that  must  be maintained by every individual who sedates children is that of successfully performing bag-valve-mask ventilation in a child who becomes apneic or develops airway obstruction.\nIndirect evidence suggests that the impact of guidelines is favorable in terms of outcomes and that adverse events are rare, especially in hospitals (Cravero et al. 2006). Adverse events, including death, have occurred at a higher rate in dental offices than in other venues, such as hospitals (Cote et al. 2000), but when cases are available  for  review,  it  is  obvious  that  most  of  the adverse events occurred when general tenets of guidelines were not followed(Chika et al. 2012; Krippaehne and  Montgomery  1992).  Sedation  guidelines  do  not ensure that adverse events will not occur if faithfully followed.  However,  it  is  highly  recommended  that dentists who  sedate patients, especially children, should be intimately familiar with sedation guidelines and incorporate  the  guideline  recommendations  into their practice and protocols to maximize favorable outcomes and safety."

Not  only  do  sedation  guidelines stress  the  importance  of  recognition  of  emergencies and the knowledge and skills to perform emergency management  interventions,  but  common  sense  dictates  a  strong  respect  for  factors  contributing  to  the likelihood that emergencies will occur as the depth of sedation increases or as  therapeutic  management boundaries are violated.\nSufficient  data  is  available  to  understand  that  the respiratory  system  is  most  likely  the  first  system  that will fail during a sedation mishap (Cote el al. 2000a). If the significantly compromised respiratory system is not adequately addressed, the natural progression of events that rapidly follows involves the cardiovascular system and  the  collapse  of  the  CNS  and  autonomic  nervous system. This fact points to the need for appreciating and adhering to some very basic tenets of patient management,  including  knowledge  of  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, not exceeding recommended therapeutic doses of drugs, focusing on patient  monitoring  and  airway  competency,  and  intimate knowledge of and skill sets in managing a compromised airway."

Its  ease  of admini  stration,  wide  margin  of  safety,  analgesic  and anxiolytic effects, and, most of all, its rapid reversibility make  it  an  ideal  drug  for  use  in  children  (PatersonTahmassebi 2003; Houpt 2004). The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), among other organizations, recognizes nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation sedation  as  a  safe  and  effective  technique  to  reduce anxiety, produce analgesia, and enhance effective communication between a patient and health care provider (AAPD 2012). However, clinicians should not make the mistake of thinking that N 2 O sedation by itself controls behavior. Nitrous oxide serves as an adjunct to behavior management.\nNitrous oxide is now widely accepted as a behavior management technique in pediatric dentistry. Wilson and  Alcaino's (2011) recent international survey, based on 311 replies, revealed that at least 56% of the respondents  used  nitrous  oxide  in  their  practices. Similar  numbers  were  found  in  a  survey  of  AAPD members  by  Wilson  in  1996  (66.3%)  and  Houpt  in 2002 (61%). Thus, in contrast to earlier studies, N 2 O is used by more practitioners, and more frequently than before. Its utilization is likely to continue, and it will probably  increase.  The  results  from  a  survey  conducted by the Academy of General Dentistry demonstrate  that  about  74%  of  American  dentists  used nitrous  oxide/oxygen  sedation  (Lynch  2007).  Adair et  al.  (2004),  who  surveyed  behavior  management teaching    techniques  in  pediatric  dentistry  advanced education  programs,  reported  that  all  US  dental schools taught N 2 O sedation."

    "context_enriched_content": "n 2 0 historic Milestones\nOver the past 200 years, nitrous oxide has been regarded as  an  asphyxiant,  a  useless  agent,  and  an  anesthetic panacea (Hogue et al. 1971). This has created a colorful history  for  the  drug.  Since  its  applicability  to  dental practice  is  still  a  topic  for  debate,  especially  in  nonwestern nations,  background knowledge of this agent can be considered relevant for the clinician.\nNot  long  after  Joseph  Priestley  synthesized  nitrous oxide in 1772, Sir Humphrey Davy reported on the pleasurable and unusual sensations following the inhalation of  nitrous  oxide  and  coined  the  term  'laughing  gas.' Davy  further  suggested  that  the  euphoria  associated with nitrous oxide inhalation would be of great benefit in the practice of dentistry (Raper 1945). Some dentists took this advice, and in the early 1840s Wells made practical use of nitrous oxide. He had his own tooth extracted while inhaling N 2 O that was used for clinical anesthesia (Archer 1944).\nAlthough the analgesic properties of N 2 O were recognized for some time, the risk of asphyxia when using it as the sole anesthetic agent prevented its use for lengthy operations. However, in 1868, Chicago surgeon Edmund W.  Andrews  published  the  results  of  a  large  survey which  suggested  that  the  anesthetic  use  of  ether  and chloroform would be safer by combining these agents with 70% N 2 O and 30% oxygen. This extended the anesthetic time for longer operations, and the notion of balanced anesthesia was born. At about the same time, gas machines  were  introduced,  making  anesthesia  more convenient. Dentistry took advantage of this progress. Before  the  turn  of  the  century,  a  limited  number  of\ndentists were beginning to use nitrous oxide and oxygen for cavity preparations.\nThroughout the first half of the twentieth century, the primary interest in nitrous oxide was in its analgesic properties (Langa 1968). Most discussions concerning nitrous oxide stressed the analgesic and anesthetic properties for extractions.  Dental  offices  remained  dependent  upon nitrous  oxide  for  pain  control  until  the  introduction  of local anesthesia. The feeling of euphoria caused by nitrous oxide,  which  was  so  sought-after  during  the  'laughing gas parties' 100 years earlier, were either ignored or considered a minor benefit during dental procedures.\nSince  the  prevalent  attitude  among  dentists  in  the early twentieth century was that young children were not  suitable  patients,  few  references  have  suggested using nitrous oxide for the child patient.  However, in 1925, physician John S. Lundy specifically described the use  of  nitrous  oxide  as  an  induction  agent  to  prepare children for extractions. Shortly thereafter, Leonard N. Ray, a dentist, acknowledged  that many  children dreaded the  thought  of  the  dentist  and  dental  extractions  (1929).  Hence,  he  advocated  the  use  of  nitrous oxide and recommended initiating induction with 90% nitrous oxide and 10% oxygen for 30 seconds. He felt that this enabled children to move quickly toward surgical anesthesia. After induction, the oxygen was lowered to 7% and nitrous oxide was increased to 93% for the  duration  of  the  procedure.  With  this  approach,  he contended  that  the  necessary  dentistry  for  children could  'go  on  unhampered  in  a  way  that  would  be impossible with a local anesthetic.' Concomitant with the  nitrous  oxide,  Ray  used  behavior  management. Suggestion,  demonstration,  and  encouragement  were necessary so that children would accept the nasal mask."

As late as 1972, Amian reported on his fifteen years of experience with nitrous oxide and indicated that nitrous oxide analgesia was used routinely for cavity preparations in children. He found that in more than 50,000 applications, usually using 60% nitrous oxide and 40% oxygen, adequate analgesia was provided for cavity preparation. He also noted that the euphoric state was a major benefit to patients. The following year, Sorenson and Roth (1973) emphasized the value of inhalation sedation to reduce children's fears, particularly the fear of injections. They de-emphasized the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide-  oxygen, which is associated with concentrations of nitrous oxide exceeding 40%, and emphasized  the  sedative/tranquilizing/euphoric  benefits  of  dilute  concentrations;  that  is,  less  than  40%  of nitrous oxide (Allen 1984; McCarthy 1969).\nIt  may  be  because  of  the  history,  but  for  many years  there  has  been  some  confusion  regarding  the terms nitrous oxide inhalation sedation and anesthetic nitrous oxide. As a consequence, anesthesiologists were opposed to the use of N 2 O by dentists. This is unfortunate because it delayed the widespread use of the agent by dentists.  Although  N 2 O  now  is routinely used in dentistry and considered a safe drug, in medicine it is frequently combined  with  other  general anesthetic agents to produce a balanced anesthesia."

Nitrous oxide has rapid uptake, as it is absorbed quickly from  the  alveoli  and  held  in  a  simple  solution  in  the serum. It is dissolved and transported in blood; it does not combine with hemoglobin, and it does not undergo biotransformation.\nIt is relatively insoluble, passing down a gradient into other tissues and cells in the body, such as the CNS. It is excreted quickly from the lungs. Elimination of nitrous oxide occurs by means of expiration in a manner that is precisely  the  reverse  of  uptake  and  distribution,  and nitrous  oxide's  low  solubility  allows  it  to  be  removed rapidly (Emmanouil and Quock, 2007)."

Nitrous oxide is also used for self-administered analgesia in cancer patients (Parlow  et  al.  2005)  to  alleviate  pain  and  discomfort associated with a number of medical procedures, and in  emergency  medicine  departments  for  procedures such as treatment of lacerations and orthopedic procedures (Baskett 1970). It is essential to make a clear distinction between the high anaesthetic concentrations of nitrous oxide which produce unconsciousness and the much lower doses that are associated with consciousness and its psychotropic actions; i.e., analgesia, anxiolysis, and  euphoria.  There  is evidence  that the relaxation and relief from anxiety during inhalation of N2 O is a specific anxiolytic effect that is independent of the analgesic action of N 2 O. The mechanisms involved are not yet completely understood. However, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that nitrous oxide's analgesic and anxiolytic actions are parallel to those of opioids  and  benzodiazepines,  respectively  (Emmanouil and Quock 2007)."

Despite its limited anesthetic potency, N 2 O is the most widely used general anesthetic agent. With a minimum alveolar concentration of 104% at 1 atm in humans, N 2 O by  itself  would  require  high-volume  percentage  and hyperbaric conditions to achieve anesthesia (Hornbein et al. 1982). Therefore, due to its low potency, in clinical practice N 2 O is generally used to reduce the minimum alveolar concentration of a second inhalation agent for anesthesia and increase the rate of induction (i.e., the second gas effect), and to provide or augment the analgesic component  of  general  anesthesia.  General  anesthetics like N 2 O have long been hypothesized to act in a nonspecific  manner on neuronal membranes, alter membrane fluidity, and/or influence ion channels. However, a great deal of work is required before the molecular and neural pathways  involved  in  mediating  nitrous  oxide  anesthesia  are  fully  determined  (Emmanouil  and  Quock 2007; Sanders et al. 2008). It is suggested that a common property of NMDA receptor antagonism may underlie the  similar  pharmacological  profiles  of  N 2 O  and  ketamine, an intravenous dissociative anesthetic. The two drugs,  in  fact,  produce  synergistic  neurotoxicity  when used together (Jevtovic-Todorovic et al. 2000)."

    "context_enriched_content": "nitrous oxide in Pediatric Dentistry: rationale and objectives\nDentistry generates more stress than most other professions,  primarily  because  of  the  working  conditions  of the dental practice (Bodner 2008). In particular, the specialty of pediatric dentistry can feature crying children, clashes with parents, and children's small mouths and teeth, which contribute to a stressful environment. The use of N 2 O sedation can reduce some of these stresses in the dental office-it helps produce a relaxed atmosphere and  it  can  benefit  everyone  in  the  pediatric  dental treatment triangle.\nThe administration of nitrous oxide has major advantages not common to other sedation agents used in dentistry  for  children.  These  include:  rapid  onset,  rapid withdrawal, and convenient dosage adjustment to maintain a tranquil and sedated state.\nIn modern dentistry, children do not often experience real  physical  pain.  Although  many  procedures  are  less than pleasurable, children usually fail to recognize shades of  gray-only  the  polarity  of  black  or  white,  pain  or no  pain.  However,  pain,  with  its  physiological  and psychological components, can be somewhat difficult to define in the clinical setting. As a result, minor discomforts can be magnified and interpreted as pain. Nitrous oxide can modify these discomforts by the diminution or elimination of pain and anxiety in a conscious patient. It is well recognized for these analgesia/anxiolysis properties.\nLike  children,  adults  have  fears  and  anxieties,  but they  are  contained  by  previous  experiences.  A  child lacking  the  experiences  of  an  adult  has  an  emotional overflow when  placed in an anxious or stressful situation. Due to a lack of experience, the child acts out primary feelings. This reaction or emotional outburst to stress or anxiety is usually in the form of fight-or-flight behavior. Children reacting this way may need assistance in  controlling  their  emotions.  Nitrous  oxide,  as  an adjunct to behavior management, can help many children learn to cope with the stressful environment.\nEmotions and pain thresholds are interwoven. When a child patient is fearful, anxious, or apprehensive, there is a lower pain threshold. Minor things may irritate and upset the patient. If minimizing pain during treatment is one of the objectives, then reducing the child patient's level of anxiety is critical. There is a positive association between  anticipatory  anxiety and  procedural  pain. Interventions designed to reduce task-specific anticipatory anxiety may help reduce pain responses in children and adolescents (Tsao et al. 2004). When N 2 O sedation eliminates or reduces fear or anxiety, it raises the pain reaction threshold and reduces fatigue (Weinstein et al. 1986). Both pain sensitivity and pain reaction are altered.\nTable 11-1. Objectives of nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation sedation.\n1.  Reduce or eliminate anxiety.\n2.  Reduce untoward movement and negative reaction to dental treatment.\n3.  Enhance communication and patient cooperation.\n4.  Raise the pain reaction threshold.\n5.  Increase tolerance for longer appointments.\n6.  Reduce gagging.\nAdditionally,  the  pain  threshold  can  be  raised  with attention and distraction tasks. When the placebo effect of distraction is combined with the sedative properties of nitrous oxide, the injection experience is much more easily accomplished.\nStudies have reported on the effects of N 2 O from the child's  perspective.  Children  described  dreaming  or being on a 'space-ride' (Hogue et al. 1971). Berger et al. (1972) reported that some children described a 'floating, warm, and tingling sensation' with nitrous oxide. In yet another study, children indicated a preference for music in conjunction with nitrous oxide during dental treatment (Anderson 1980). Langa (1968) described the child  under  N 2 O  sedation  as  being  in  'suspended animation'; i.e., the child's body does not move, head and extremities remain relaxed, and sudden movements commonly associated with children are eliminated. With the  child  in  a  relaxed  state,  a  dentist  can  provide optimum treatment for a child with minimum trauma for  both  dentist  and  patient.  Following  the  foregoing rationale for the use of nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation, many  pediatric  dentists  adopted  the  technique  for managing their child patients. The objectives for nitrous oxide usage are shown in Table 11-1."

    "context_enriched_content": "stages of anesthesia\nFour  stages  of  general  anesthesia  were  recognized  in Guedel's classification: (1) induction (also referred to as analgesia),  (2)  excitement,  (3)  surgical  anesthesia,  and (4)  overdose (Guedel 1937). The first stage begins with the induction of anesthesia and ends with a patient's loss of consciousness. Patients still feel pain in this stage. In 1968, Langa introduced a term to represent N 2 O inhalation sedation: relative analgesia (RA). Langa (1968) proposed that there were three planes of analgesia in the first stage. The planes vary from moderate to total analgesia and are dependent on the concentration of nitrous oxide in  the  mixture and the signs and symptoms shown by patients (Table 11-2). During N 2 O inhalation sedation, the patient always remains at the first stage of anesthesia.\nIn Plane  One  (5-25%  N2 O) the patient appears normal, relaxed, and awake, and may feel slight tingling in  toes,  fingers,  tongue,  or  lips,  and  may  giggle.

There  are  no  definite  clinical manifestations.\nIn Plane Two, or relative analgesia (20-55% N 2 O), the patient  may  have  a  dreamy  look,  eyes  appearing 'glassy' (occasionally with tears), reactions are slowed and  the  voice  may  sound  'throaty.'  The  patient  will feel warm and drowsy, may drift in and out of the surrounding environment, and may hear pleasant ringing in  the  ears.  Partial  amnesia  may  occur.  Vital  signs remain  normal.  Pain  is  reduced  or  eliminated,  but touch  and  pressure  are  still  perceived.  The  patient  is less  aware  of  surroundings;  sounds  and  smells  are dulled. The term psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN)  was    introduced  by  Gillman  and  Lichtigfeld (1994)  to  describe  Plane  Two  of  analgesia.  This  term clearly distinguishes the concentrations of nitrous oxide  used  for  anxiolysis/analgesia  from  the  much higher doses used for anesthesia, wherein the patient is totally unconscious.\nIn  Plane  Three  (55-70%  N 2 O),  the  patient  becomes angry, with a hard stare; the pupils usually are centrally fixed and dilated, the mouth tends to close frequently, and  the  patient  is  unaware  of  his  surroundings  and may  hallucinate.  When  patients  are  in  Plane  Three, Roberts (1990) reported that they may experience sensations of flying, falling,  or  uncontrolled  spinning, or the chest may feel heavy, and the patient will no longer cooperate.\nPlane  Two  provides  adequate  N 2 O  sedation  and allows dentist-child communication, although some clinicians prefer the dream period, usually characterized by closed eyes and difficulty with speech. Figure 11-1 portrays a patient's appearance in Plane Two. Plane One is  usually  of  short  duration,  while  Plane  Two  can  be maintained  for  several  hours.  Children  in  Plane  Two usually respond to questions by moving the head rather than speaking. Facial features are relaxed and the jaw usually sags, remaining open without mouth props.

Suggestions, such as 'fixing teeth is fun,' made while a patient is experiencing N 2 O sedation might make subsequent  visits easier and  more  readily accepted (Whalley and Brooks 2009). Another beneficial suggestion is to instruct ways to improve oral hygiene.\nPatient answers rapidly: sedation is too light.\nPatient answers slowly and deliberately: good sedation.\nPatient does not answer: may be tired and asleep. If used in combination with another sedative agent, stimulate patient and check verbally.

Some individuals  experience  several  symptoms,  while  others experience only a few. Symptoms are intense for some and  insignificant  for  others.  Sometimes  signs  are obvious;  at  other  times,  they  are  subtle.  Titration allows for the biovariablility of any patient that may be associated with the administration of the substance. Titrating  nitrous  oxide/oxygen  and  careful  observation of patient responses are keys to successful administration.\nClinicians  must  know what signs and symptoms to look  for  when  administering  and  monitoring  N 2 O sedation(Table 11-3).. Keeping a constant vigil is imperative  because pleasant sensations may quickly change and become unpleasant.

At the initial examination the child appeared cooperative, but the dentist recognized her apprehension. Despite this observation, the  dentist  elected  to  treat  Donna  through  behavior shaping,  a  non-pharmacological  approach.  Performing dentistry  quadrant  by  quadrant,  the  dentist  achieved good patient cooperation at the first and second restorative dentistry appointments. At the third visit, the child cried during the injection but eventually calmed down. When the time arrived for the fourth and final restorative treatment, Donna's parent forcibly brought her to the office. The child cried continuously and hysterically refused the injection.\nCase  11.1,  Discussion: While  the  ultimate  goal  is  to increase  patient  comfort  through  relaxation  (Clark  and Brunick  2007),  another  important  goal  is  for  nitrous oxide/oxygen to serve as an adjunct to behavior management. It is not for all patients, and before selecting  a  management  method  for  any  pediatric  patient, careful behavior observation is needed. After observing the child during the examination visit, the dentist has to anticipate future cooperation and balance this evaluation against treatment requirements. In Donna's case, where minor  apprehension  was  observed  at  the  examination visit, one or two restorative appointments likely would not  have  created  a  problem.  However,  sitting  for  four restorative visits is a different matter, and the child failed to tolerate the protracted series of appointments. There is no formula for precisely predicting such problems, and the ability to detect them in advance is usually gained by experience. Choosing the proper behavioral strategy in this type of case can be difficult. Nonetheless, whenever a dentist begins treating an apprehensive but cooperative and likeable child who becomes a behavior problem, the behavior management approach is open to question.\nIn  hindsight,  the  negative  outcome  of  Donna's  case should not have occurred. If her perceived apprehension had  been  addressed,  it  likely  would  have  created  an improved end result. A pharmacological adjunct would benefit the child, helping her with a difficult initiation to dentistry. Donna is the ideal candidate for nitrous oxide/ oxygen inhalation sedation. She was communicative and in control of herself. N 2 O offers a reasonable adjunctive therapy for Donna's behavior management. This is the type of situation that Musselman and McClure referred to  as  a  'preventive  medication'  (1975)  in  the  original behavior management book. It is given to a child who is unnecessarily strained by the dental situation and who could  become  a  more  difficult  management  problem. Providing  comfort  with  N 2 O  at  an  initial  dental  visit impacts children's later experiences, resulting in improved  behaviors  and  less  anxiety  at  subsequent visits. This effect can be seen even if N 2 O is not administered at later visits (Nathan et al. 1988; Collado, 2006)."

It is important to state that the child's feelings of anxiety or fear are not unique, but are observed in many children coming for the first operative visit. A brief explanation, such as the one following, assures a parent that the drug has no lingering effects and is routinely used safely.\nDentist: Mrs. Jones, Donna is such a nice girl. I have noticed that most children feel nervous at the first few visits. As we explained earlier, our goal is to help Donna become a good dental patient without fears. To make the visit more acceptable  to  her,  we  are  going  to  use  nitrous  oxide,  which  is commonly known as 'laughing gas.' As she breathes in the gas she will feel less nervous. The nitrous oxide will make the injection of local anesthesia easier. Donna will have the feeling of a relatively shorter session. When it is used with proper technique it helps children enjoy dentistry . Its effects will be gone at the end of the appointment, so you shouldn't worry after the appointment.\nAdditionally, parents may be given a nitrous oxide parent information pamphlet and the opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure. Informed consent for the procedure and for the N 2 O sedation must be obtained and filed  in  the  patient's  chart.  The  patient's  record  should also include the indication for use of N 2 O sedation. Indeed, as for other pharmacologic agents, documentation is very important. A written record detailing the concentration of nitrous oxide administered, monitored patient variables, the  duration  of  the  procedure,  post-treatment  oxygenation procedure, and any complications encountered (or lack thereof) should be entered in the patient chart.\nCritical to beginning the nitrous oxide-oxygen procedure  is  the  acceptance  of  the  nasal  mask  by  the child; hence, this treatment is not advised for the resistant  pediatric  patient.  At  the  outset  it  is  important  to check that the child does not have a cold and can breathe through the nose. There are many techniques to introduce the nasal mask.

Total liters flow per minute (L/min) is adjusted depending on the size and age of the child. The reservoir bag should be approximately 2/3 full. When the patient breathes in, the bag  moves  and  collapses  slightly,  but  not  fully.  When expiration occurs, the bag distends, but not fully. Tidal volumes  have  to  be  tailored  to  individual  patients.  To assist  in  determining the starting point, Table 11-4 provides data for children up to age ten. Note that as children get  older,  the  respiration  rate  decreases.  Conversely,  as children get older and larger, the tidal volume increases."

    "context_enriched_content": "titrating gases for sedation\nChildren need to be instructed to breathe properly. After three or four breaths, the child is instructed to close the mouth  once and breathe once through the nose. Afterward, the child is told to breathe twice, and then three  times.  Increasingly,  the  child  will  switch  over  to breathing  exclusively  through  the  nose-a  gradual introduction of the gas has occurred.\nObserving  the  movement  of  the  reservoir  bag  is essential for monitoring breathing. A fully distended bag hampers monitoring. Therefore, if the bag is distended, the  clinician  needs  to  start  by  checking  the  child's breathing. Instruct the child to breathe deeply and demonstrate  what  is  meant.  'I  would  like  you  to  breathe more: breathe in as hard as you can.'\nIf  the  bag does not move, lower the volume of gas in-flowing. Check for a snug fit of the nasal mask to ensure a closed circuit. An improper fit allows gas leakage to contaminate the clinician's immediate environment  (breathing  zone).  Escaping  gas  influences  the movement of the reservoir bag, but it also can irritate a child's eyes. A further check should be made for any kinks in the gas lines that might obstruct the gas flow. Once  the  volume  of  gas  flow  has  been  established (about  2-3  minutes  of  oxygen),  titration  of  gases  for sedation commences.\nYoung  children  often  have  to  be  instructed  to breathe  properly.  Rapid,  shallow  breathing  (tachypnea) may  not provide the alveolar ventilation required for uptake of a gas mixture. In these cases, the dentist can demonstrate the breathing technique. Most children imitate the modeling. Repeated instructions are made to keep the mouth closed, thus encouraging nasal breathing. It may be necessary to place a finger on the lips of very young children to teach them to breathe properly through the nasal mask. The use of the rubber dam also helps with proper breathing. Once the dam is in place, mouth breathing is difficult and nasal breathing is easier.\nThere are two methods to initially administer nitrous oxide to children: the standard titration technique and the rapid induction technique."

    "id": "52. Behavior-Management-in-Dentistry-for-Children_330",
    "context_enriched_content": "Standard Titration Technique\nThe  standard  titration  technique  (also  known  as  slow titration technique or slow induction technique) is used by  many  dentists  for  adults  and  older  children.  The technique  begins  slowly  with  100%  oxygen. After  2-3 minutes,  gases  are  adjusted  to  approximately  20% nitrous oxide and 80% oxygen. Every 1-2 minutes, the gas ratio is altered. The nitrous level is increased about 10% and the oxygen flow is lowered concomitantly. The total  gas  flow,  which  was  established  at  the  outset,  is maintained. Often gas is titrated close to a 1:1 ratio for the  injection  and  rubber  dam  procedures,  and  then decreased  to  about  a  30%  nitrous  oxide  level  during restorative procedures. Success with the standard titration  technique  is  dependent,  to  a  large  degree,  on  the patient properly describing the effects of the gas. If used for younger children, they have to be guided throughout the process. The child is told, 'Soon the magic air will make you feel funny, and you will probably laugh, too. Don't  forget  to  breathe  through  your  nose  and  not through your toes!'\nAfter  about  a  half  minute,  the  child  is  asked,  'Are your  arms  getting  tired?  You  sure  hold  that  well.' Following  the  usual  affirmative  response,  the  child  is told to lower her arms and the assistant is instructed to secure the nasal mask. 'Soon you will feel funny. You remember  why  I  am  doing  this-so  I  don't  hurt  you when  I  fix  your  teeth.  You  know,  you  are  doing  this better than most four-year-old children. We all like you here (positive verbal reinforcement). Pretty soon you are going  to  start  to  feel  funny.  Your  legs  and  feet  might tickle or feel heavy. You might feel as if you are flying in an airplane. You will feel really good.'\nMaintaining a constant and almost monotonous voice contact lulls the patient into a state of security. Try not to use specific terms about how the patient will feel, espe- cially with older children. The power of suggestion can lead them to respond positively and create a false perception of the N 2 O effectiveness. On the other hand, if a child makes non-coherent comments or show signs of loss of control or agitation, this could be indicative of an overdose.  Lower  the  concentration:  do  not  increase  it under this circumstance.\nAt the end of the procedure, 100% oxygen should be delivered  for  at  least  3-5  minutes.  This  is  specifically important while treating children (AAPD guideline), as they de-saturate rapidly. As nitrous oxide is thirty-four times  more  soluble  than  nitrogen  in  blood,  diffusion hypoxia  may  occur.  The  patient  may  be  discharged when she has returned to normal (pre-sedation) levels of consciousness and has regained normal speech and gait (Jastak and Orendruff 1975)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Rapid Induction Technique\nAn alternative method for nitrous oxide administration is the rapid induction technique. This technique can be divided into four phases, and is described in Table 11-5 (Simon  and  Vogelsberg  1975).  Similar  to  the  standard titration technique, rapid induction begins for our fouryear-old patient with about 4 liters of oxygen. However, after 1-2 minutes, the gas is delivered in a 1:1 ratio: half nitrous oxide and half oxygen. It is maintained at this level  for  5-10  minutes,  and  once  injections  have  been given and a rubber dam placed, the nitrous oxide level is decreased  and  the  oxygen  is  increased.  The  patient  is maintained on a 25%-35% nitrous level, using the preestablished volume of gas. Similar to the slow titration, 100% oxygen is administered at the end of the procedure for  about  3-5  minutes.  Because  the  administration  is much more rapid, the patient's signs are watched closely. These can involve body movements, eye signs, or even slurring of speech. If there is concern that the sedation is too deep, the nitrous oxide is lowered. This technique is most appropriate for the very young child or the highly anxious patient, as it allows the clinician to deal with the behavior much more quickly.\nRegardless of the technique that is used, two opinions are found regarding changes in N 2 O concentration during treatment.  One  approach  (which  is  part  of  the  AAPD\nTable 11-5. Phases of inhalation sedation with dosages.\n\nIntroduction, Dosage = 3-5 liters oxygen. Injection, Dosage = 2 liters nitrous oxide : 2 liters oxygen (50%). Maintenance, Dosage = 1-2 liters nitrous oxide : 3 liters oxygen (25-40%). Withdrawal, Dosage = 3-5 liters oxygen\nguidelines)  is  that  it  may  be  decreased  during  easier procedures  (e.g.,  restorations)  and  increased  during more stimulating ones (e.g., extraction, injection of local anesthetic). Opponents of this technique opine that frequent changes in N 2 O concentrations may cause unnecessary  nausea  and  result  in  vomiting;  the  sensation  is likened to a roller coaster ride. These clinicians keep the N2 O concentration steady throughout all types of dental procedures.\nGenerally,  during  nitrous  oxide/oxygen  analgesia/ anxiolysis,  the  concentration  of  nitrous  oxide  should not  routinely  exceed  50%.  At  concentrations  greater than 50%, N 2 O may cause deep sedation, which generally has been found to be associated with an increased risk of adverse events (Hoffman et al. 2002, Babl et al. 2008).  In  addition,  during  N 2 O sedation  without  any additional sedative agent, the AAPD guideline requires only that continual clinical observation of the patient's responsiveness, color, and respiratory rate and rhythm be  performed.  However,  if  higher  concentrations  are used, the patient may experience minimal or moderate sedation, which requires monitoring with pulse oximetry, blood pressure cuff, and precordial stethoscope or capnograph.\nFor  safety  reasons,  the  dentist  should  always  be accompanied by assisting personnel. At least one staff member must be present in the treatment room at all times  during  the  administration  of  nitrous  oxide,  and the patient should never be left unattended.\nGenerally,  the  nitrous  oxide  should  not  be  used without local  anesthesia.  However,  to  avoid  any  local anesthesia  discomfort,  some  clinicians  take  advantage of nitrous oxide analgesic properties and perform minor procedures, like class I cavity restorations, without local anesthesia (Hammond and Full 1984). The downside of avoiding local anesthesia is that the operative procedure may or may not be pain-free. As with other pharmacotherapeutic  and  nonpharmacotherapeutic  techniques, the key to success is the avoidance of pain. Some dentists  will  try  to  avoid  the  injection  of  local  anesthesia when  confronted  with  a  resistant  child  or  parent. However, with nitrous oxide sedation and good injection technique, the small amount of discomfort from the injection becomes subclinical and the use of local anesthetic is highly recommended."

    "context_enriched_content": "adverse effects\nWhen administered by trained personnel on carefully selected patients with appropriate equipment and technique,  nitrous  oxide  is  a  safe  and  effective  agent  for providing  pharmacological  guidance  of  behavior  in children  with  relatively  few  adverse  effects.  This  was recently documented in a large French survey series of 7,571  children  receiving  demand  valve  50%  N 2 O  in which a low rate of major adverse events was reported (0.3%). All adverse events were resolved within   minutes, and none of the patients needed any airway intervention (Gall et al. 2001 ). The safety of 50% N 2 O for procedural  sedation  also  has  been  demonstrated  in  studies encompassing thousands of patients (Hennequin et al. 2004; Onody et al. 2006).\nHeadache and disorientation can occur occasionally. They result from acute hypoxia, a rapid release of nitrous oxide  from  the  blood  stream  into  the  alveoli.  These adverse effects can be avoided by administering 100% oxygen after discontinuing the nitrous oxide at the end of treatment.\nThe  most  common,  though  infrequent,  complication found to occur with the administration of nitrous oxide to children is vomiting. For this reason, some practitioners instruct patients to refrain from eating prior to the dental appointment. There are conflicting views on the need for this,  and  also  on  the  length  of  fasting  time  prior  to  a procedure. Although the frequency of vomiting during N2 O is very low, there are dentists who require fasting for all  children  undergoing  N 2 O sedation. They argue that since the foremost adverse reaction associated with N 2 O sedation is vomiting, a complete fast should be enforced. Dentists who oppose fasting for the use of N 2 O sedation may reason that the incidence of vomiting is very low and, in the event of such an occurrence, no life-threatening risks exist since the patient is not deeply sedated and remains  in  control  of  all  reflexes,  unlike  the  deeply sedated child. Aspiration of vomitus is unlikely when the protective airway reflexes are intact. Consequently, pulmonary aspiration is highly unlikely to occur.\nSeveral  studies  have  looked  at  this  issue.  Babl  et  al. (2005) examined the relationship between fasting status and  adverse  events  during  procedural  sedation  with nitrous  oxide  in  the  emergency  department  (ED).  Preprocedural fasting is difficult to obtain in the ED, since procedures are unscheduled and non-elective. Although in this study 71.1% of patients studied did not meet fasting guidelines for solids, no serious adverse events and no  episodes  of  aspiration  were  found.  The  study  concluded that N 2 O is a safe agent for procedural analgesia and sedation, without serious adverse events and with a low rate of temporary, mild adverse events. No association between pre-procedural fasting and emesis was found.\nIn earlier investigations, there were mixed opinions on the frequency of vomiting. Hogue et al. (1971) reported no ill  effects  administering  between  5%  and  40%  N 2 O; however, Houck and Ripa (1971) found that 10% of the children vomited while receiving maintenance concentrations between 30%-60% N 2 O. These   latter investigators  recommended  that  dentists  ask  the  following  in\nhealth questionnaires to screen for patients who might be potentially high-risk candidates for vomiting.\n- Has  your  child  vomited  during  previous  dental treatments?\n- Does  your  child  experience  motion  sickness-car, airplane?\n- Does your child have influenza or any gastrointestinal infections?\nFor patients with a history of vomiting or car sickness , an antiemetic may be prescribed."

    "context_enriched_content": "adverse effects\nMore recently, a cross-over design by Kupietzky et al. (2008) assessed the relationship between fasting status and  vomiting  with  N 2 O  sedation.  The  average  time between  eating  and  treatment  in  the  fasting  sessions was  6  hours,  and  1  hour  in  the  non-fasting  group. A rapid induction method of constant, non-fluctuating concentration/flow  of  50%  N 2 O  was  used.  Vomiting occurred in only one subject, immediately after   cessation of treatment resulting in a frequency of 1% of subjects or 0.5% of sessions. No other differences were found between fasting and non-fasting subjects.\nIn addition to the low frequency of vomiting occurring  during  nitrous  administration,  there  are  other reasons  not  to  require  preprocedural  fasting.  A  child fasting  may  be  agitated  and  will  be  less  cooperative during dental treatment, thus defeating the purpose of N2 O  sedation  use.  Unfed  children  are  often  cranky, sometimes  combative,  and  occasionally  dehydrated (Gleghorn 1997). Parents accompanying a fasting child will also be less cooperative. A hungry child is irritable and therefore more difficult to sedate. Consequently, the dentist  may  decide  to  use  a  higher  N 2 O  sedation concentration to overcome this child's disruptive behavior. The higher dose may result in over-sedation, which in itself can cause of vomiting. Another paradox to  be  considered  is  that  patients  treated  on  an  empty stomach are more susceptible to nausea and vomiting.\nClinical Tip: There are times when a child has been undergoing a lengthy procedure and becomes fidgety. This could be a signal that nausea and vomiting is an impending problem. It also could mean that the patient is slipping into the Excitement Stage. Because the child is  fidgeting,  the  clinician  may  consider  increasing  the nitrous oxide level. This is not an uncommon response. But the correct thing is lower the nitrous oxide level.\nNausea and vomiting that occur during N 2 O sedation are usually associated with the following causes: oversedation  (N 2 O  concentration too high for patient, Malamed  2009);  the  'roller  coaster'  effect  of  sharp increases and decreases in concentrations of N 2 O administered (Clark and Brunick 2007); sedation length-the longer the patient has N 2 O, the greater the incidence of nausea and vomiting (Zier and Liu 2011); and a prior history of nausea and vomiting.\nThe AAPD guideline on use of nitrous oxide for pediatric dental patients states that 'Fasting is not required for patients undergoing nitrous oxide analgesia/anxiolysis.  The  practitioner,  however,  may  recommend  that only a light meal be consumed in the 2 hours prior to the administration of nitrous oxide.'"

    "context_enriched_content": "Contraindications\nNitrous oxide/oxygen sedation cannot be used to control all forms of child behavior, especially those that are hysterical or defiant. No positive effect will be obtained treating the crying, hysterical child with whom the dentist  cannot  communicate.  Forcing  a  nasal  mask  on  a child  in  this  circumstance  only  escalates  the  torment. Truly defiant children will not accept a nasal hood gracefully  or  cooperate  adequately  for  nasal  inhalation  of nitrous oxide.\nNitrous oxide sedation should not be used when any condition is present which might lead to nasal blockage and  prevent  a  child  from  sufficiently  inhaling  the nitrous: the common cold, upper respiratory infections (URI) or bronchitis, allergies, or hay fever. Patients with blocked Eustachian tubes can experience ear pain due to distention  of  the  tympanic  membrane.  Administering nitrous oxide to a child with a middle ear infection may result  in  a  ruptured  eardrum.  Nitrous  oxide  is  forty times more soluble in blood than nitrogen. This allows it to rapidly diffuse into closed gas spaces within the body, exerting  pressure  effects  locally.  Related  to  this  cavity expanding phenomenon, nitrous oxide can prove problematic in those patients with bowel obstruction, since it may  lead  to  expansion  of  gas  with  readily  apparent adverse consequences. Other areas of trapped gas may not be so clinically apparent; patients who have undergone  recent  retinal  surgery  may  have  intraocular  gas that may expand during N 2 O administration, leading to intraocular hypertension and irreversible loss of vision (Lockwood and Yang 2008).\nAlthough nitrous oxide can be safely administered to most asthmatics and those with other forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there is a small subset of these patients in whom its use is not prudent. Those patients with severe pulmonary disease who use hypoxic drive (lack of oxygen) to stimulate breathing, rather than the normal mechanisms mediated by carbon dioxide accumulation, reflect a relative contraindication to the use of nitrous oxide. This is due to the fact that: (1) the patients are usually more sensitive to the sedative effects of nitrous oxide, and (2) supplemental oxygen is also  administered  with  nitrous  oxide,  increasing  the\npatient's oxygen uptake and thereby removing the stimulus to breathe. Generally, those patients with bronchial asthma can receive nitrous oxide because it is nonirritating to the bronchial and pulmonary tissues. Increased stress can lead to an asthmatic attack; therefore, nitrous sedation can be helpful.\nNitrous  oxide  also  can  have  a  disproportionately stronger effect on special patients taking tranquilizers, analgesics,  antidepressants,  or  antipsychotic  drugs,  or those  who  have  a  depressed  level  of  consciousness. Other potential adverse events, such as myeloneuropathy  associated  with  N 2 O  administration  to  a  vitamin B12-deficient  patient,  may  be  rarer  still,  yet  clinicians offering  N 2 O sedation  should  be  aware  of  this  potentially serious complication (Flippo and Holder 1993).\nThe  increased risk of  spontaneous  abortions  and malformations  in  humans  is  controversial,  although animal studies show various risk potentials (fetotoxicity at 450-1,000 ppm in rats) . No association has been found between trace levels of waste nitrous oxide in scavenged locations and adverse health effects to personnel. Reduced fertility has been reported for those who do not use scavenging equipment and who are exposed to nitrous oxide more than 3 hours per week (Rowland et al. 1992). Still, it is  advised  that  females  should  not  administer  nitrous oxide during the first trimester of pregnancy."

Safety features have been designed to prevent  hypoxia  by  ensuring  a  minimal  oxygen  flow, thus  limiting  the  amount  of  nitrous  oxide  that  can  be administered.  Donaldson  et  al.  (2012)  reviewed  the twelve safety features used to ensure the safety and efficacy of N 2 O sedation. The authors discussed examples of safety feature failures, as well as steps to help prevent negative outcomes.\nNitrous oxide/oxygen delivery systems typically are limited  to  a  maximum  of  70%  nitrous  oxide  and  30% oxygen  delivery,  which  ensures  that  the  patient  is receiving at least 9% more oxygen than found in ambient air.  Other  safety  features  stop  the  delivery  of  nitrous oxide if oxygen flow stops. The pin-index safety system prevents  the  accidental  attachment  of  a  non-oxygen tank  to  the  oxygen  attachment  portal,  and  diameter index  systems  help  ensure  that  the  appropriate  gas flows through the appropriate tubing. Although these safety features are in place, dentists have reported incidents of hypoxia involving incorrect equipment installation or equipment damage. If a safety feature failure is suspected  during  administration  of  N 2 O sedation,  the clinician should remove the face mask from the patient immediately.\nIf the patient's oxygen saturation drops by 2% or more from  baseline  measurement,  nitrous  oxide  should  be discontinued and the cylinder used must be checked for potential failure.\nScavenging of waste gas ideally should be done with the  aid  of  an  ejector  run  by  compressed  air,  and  not through the vacuum system of the dental unit. This ejector  should  have  a  capacity  of  scavenging  25  liters  per minute."

    "context_enriched_content": "Minimal and Moderate sedation agents\nStephen Wilson\nSedation usually implies a modification of the level of consciousness  of  an  individual,  ideally  resulting  in  a state of lessened anxiety or fear, relaxation, and sometimes favorable mood enhancement. The change in consciousness can be induced through non-pharmacological or pharmacological intervention. This chapter will focus solely on pharmacologically-mediated changes in consciousness.\nSedative medications alter the level of consciousness of an individual. The level of consciousness is represented as a continuum ranging from full wakefulness to complete coma and is dependent, to a degree, on the number and dose  of  pharmacological  agents  administered  to  the individual. Hence, the level or depth of sedation is often referred to as an indirect, continuous index of the patient's level of consciousness at any given point in time.\nThere are many ways to define levels or depths of sedation.  Nonetheless,  definitions  of  sedation  are  found  in sedation guidelines offered by various professional organizations (American Dental Association 2007; American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry 2006; American Society of  Anesthesiologists  2002).  The  most  frequently  used guidelines  for  sedation  of  the  pediatric  patient  in  any setting including dentistry is that of the current American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAP/AAPD). Three different levels of sedation are defined in those guidelines:\nMinimal (old  terminology  of  'anxiolysis'):  a  druginduced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands. Although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.\nModerate (old  terminology  'conscious  sedation'  or 'sedation/analgesia'):  a  drug-induced  depression  of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands (e.g., 'open your eyes,' either alone  or  accompanied  by  light  tactile  stimulation-a light  tap  on  the  shoulder  or  face,  not  a  sternal  rub).\nFor    older  patients,  this  level  of  sedation  implies  an interactive state; for younger patients, age-appropriate behaviors (e.g., crying) occur and are expected. Reflex withdrawal,  although  a  normal  response  to  a  painful stimulus, is not considered to be the only age-appropriate  purposeful  response-it  must  be  accompanied  by another  response,  such  as  pushing  away  the  painful stimulus so as to confirm a higher cognitive function. With moderate sedation, no intervention is required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is  adequate.  Cardiovascular  function  is  usually  maintained.  However,  in  the  case  of  procedures  that  may themselves  cause  airway  obstruction  (e.g.,  dental  or endoscopic), the practitioner must recognize an obstruction and assist the patient in opening the airway. If the patient  is  not  making  spontaneous  efforts  to  open  his airway and relieve the obstruction, then he should be considered to be deeply sedated.\nDeep : a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused, but respond purposefully (see discussion of reflex withdrawal above) after repeated verbal or painful stimulation (e.g., purposefully  pushing  away  the  noxious  stimuli).  The  ability  to independently maintain ventilator function may  be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a  patent  airway,  and  spontaneous  ventilation  may  be inadequate.  Cardiovascular  function  is  usually  maintained. A state of deep sedation may be accompanied by partial or complete loss of protective airway reflexes.\nIn this chapter, the focus is on minimal and moderate sedation.  However,  it  is  important  to  remember  that any  sedative  drug  and  its  dose  can  produce  variable levels  of  sedation.  It  is  therefore  impossible  and  inappropriate  to  refer  to  any  one  drug  as  a  'drug  that produces minimal sedation.' Indeed, it may produce a state  of  minimal sedation in most children, but others may respond either in a less (hypo-responder) or a more (hyper-responder) exaggerated fashion than expected."

    "context_enriched_content": "Minimal and Moderate sedation agents\nA  major  theme  and  important  concept  in  the  AAP/ AAPD sedation guidelines  is  that  of  rescue.  Rescue,  as used in the guidelines, refers to a practitioner's knowledge, training, and skills in providing competent management for the patient who is in the process of or could potentially drift  into  a  compromised  condition.  Ultimately,  any practitioner who sedates a child for a procedure must be able to recognize any compromised state of the child and act  immediately  to  stabilize  the  patient  and  prevent  a disastrous outcome. The most frequently occurring compromised  state  resulting  from  sedation  in  children  is respiratory  depression.  Therefore,  practitioners  must  be efficient and effective in basic airway management skills, including the use of positive pressure oxygen with a bagvalve-mask. It is, therefore, essential that specialty training programs  provide  appropriate  experiences  for  trainees before they are allowed to sedate children. Training may best be obtained by   dedicated anesthesiology rotations in which  trainees  are  frequently  and  directly  exposed  to compromised  respiratory  conditions  and  mentored  by highly trained, skilled professionals."

    "context_enriched_content": "Drugs\nDrugs have been used to sedate children for dental procedures for well over a century. Isolated reports reviewing  drugs  as  'premedications'  for  children  during dental procedures can be found in the literature of the 1950s  and  1960s.  The  same  drugs,  other  than  alcohol, paralleling that era were also used in medicine for various conditions with barbiturates dominating for almost the  first  half  of  the  20th  century  (Lopez-Munoz  et  al. 2005).  Other  notable  drugs  of  that  time  were  chloral hydrate, opiums (primarily morphine), and bromides.\nIn 1952, Ruble conducted a classic review of that era's agents. He described the current literature of the   primary and popular drugs, including barbiturates, bromides, and morphine. Interestingly, as described in his review, the issues and challenges of the 1950s remain consistent with those of today. The premedication was indicated for the 'nervous  and  highly apprehensive  child.'  Concern revolved around the depth of sedation, dose, and route of administration. Family guidance at home, school, and in  the  dental  office,  or  the  lack  thereof,  resulted  in  the 'happy' versus 'maladjusted' individual. It was noted that a 'screaming, violent child' made relatively simple procedures difficult and time-consuming for the dental team, and that sedation was 'helpful to the child and the dentist.' Other studies and written opinions of the day addressed these issues as well (Aduss et al. 1961; Album 1955; Buckman 1956; Lampshire 1950).\nThere have been eleven surveys over the past four  decades  identifying  several  agents  used  to  sedate children for dental procedures. They are listed with the references at the end of the chapter. The more common agents  identified  were  nitrous  oxide,  chloral  hydrate, meperidine,  midazolam  (and  other  benzodiazepines), and hydroxyzine (and other antihistamines). Agents such as morphine, alphaprodine, barbiturates, and chlorpromazine  have  been  mentioned  as  well  (Brandt  and  Bugg 1984; Doring 1985; Lambert et al. 1988; Myers and Shoaf 1977; Riekman and Ross 1981; Roberts et al. 1992). The more common agents fall into four categories: hypnotics, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, and inhalation agents. This chapter will focus on the oral route for these agents."

Although chloral  hydrate  can  be  and  has  been  used  as  a  single agent  (Anderson  1960;  Czaarnecki  and  Binns  1963), most recent studies have investigated chloral hydrate in combination with one or more additional agents.

    "context_enriched_content": "Characteristics\nChloral hydrate was discovered in 1832 by Justus Liebig and  was  introduced  in  medicine  as  an  anesthetic and  hypnotic  drug  in  1869  (Stetson  1962).  It  acts  by depressing the central nervous system. Its mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is thought to involve the GABA receptor complex (Lu and Greco 2006). As a hypnotic, therapeutic doses of chloral hydrate can cause sleepiness, drowsiness, or, in some cases, hyperactivity. Care must be exercised whenever using chloral hydrate in combination with other agents, as the depth of sedation may increase and respiratory depression can occur. A unique effect of chloral hydrate is the potential inhibition of  the  tongue's  genioglossal  muscle  (Hershenson  et  al. 1984). Children with large tonsils (see Chapter Ten) and adenoid tissue may not be appropriate chloral hydrate recipients  because  of  the  increased  likelihood  of  upper airway blockage, especially when the patient is prone.\nChloral hydrate is an oily substance and a noted irritant to mucosal tissue. Hence, it should not be used in patients who have conditions involving gastritis, esophagitis,  or  oral  lesions.  Care  must  also  be  taken  to  avoid\ncontact of chloral hydrate with the conjunctiva of eyes, which  may  occur  when  orally  administering  chloral hydrate when  the  patient coughs  or spits.  Rapid administration  of  chloral  hydrate  in  children  using  a needleless syringe with splashing against the posterior portion  of  the  mouth  should  also  be  avoided.  Chloral hydrate  in  higher  doses  has  also  been  associated  with cardiac dysrhythmias; therefore, its use should be avoided in patients with certain cardiac conditions.\nChloral  hydrate  has  no  analgesic  properties.  It  has an unpleasant taste and usually requires a flavoring vehicle when orally administered. The formulation and production of the oral solution of chloral hydrate in the United States was ceased in April 2012, but it remains available in other  countries.  Other  formulations  of  chloral  hydrate (e.g., capsules) are still available in the United States, however, and oral solutions of chloral hydrate can be formulated by local pharmacists, should they elect to do so."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 12.1\nFour-year-old Jessica was scheduled to receive quadrant restorative dentistry under minimal sedation. Her mother was  given  a  plastic  syringe  filled  with  5  cc  of  choral hydrate  syrup  and  instructed  to  administer  the  drug to  her  daughter. After  a  couple  of  minutes  the  mother called  for  assistance.  Jessica  had  refused  to  swallow the   medicine-she spit it out and onto her mother, all the time screaming hysterically and kicking.\nCase  12.1,  Discussion : One  of  the  very  challenging aspects  of  using  minimal-sedation  oral  sedatives  is  the administration  of  the  drug.  The  majority  of  patients undergoing minimal sedation are uncooperative, and at many times exhibit defiant behavior. Failure to ingest the prescribed dose of   medication will inevitably result in a less-than-optimal  sedation  session.  In  many  instances, parents have difficulty administering the syrup. When the dentist is faced with a situation similar to the one described above-when he is unsure of how much of the drug has been consumed-it may be hazardous to administer more of the drug in order to continue with the appointment.\nThe dentist should first offer the parent the option of giving  their  child  the  drug,  explaining  why  the  child must swallow the entire dose. The child may be coaxed by the parent into taking the relatively small amount of syrup, followed by a minute amount of water. A cup or syringe should be offered. Some children will be more willing  to  drink  the  syrup  from  a  cup  rather  than  a syringe. However, in many instances the parent will fail.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 12-1. The dentist embraces the child's head (a) and slowly dribbles the solution down and off the finger or thumb of the non-dominant hand that is strategically placed on the retromolar pad of the patient (b). This usually stimulates the swallowing reflex and gives the child a chance to coordinate breathing and swallowing.\nEven if this result is anticipated, it may be wise to allow the  parent  to  fail,  as  this  will  facilitate  consent  to  the drug's administration by the dentist.\nOnce consent to administer the drug is given, stand the child in front of the sitting dentist. The child's head is  tilted  backward.  The  parent  restrains  the  child's hands. The dentist embraces the child's head and slowly dribbles the solution down and off the finger or thumb of the non-dominant hand that is strategically placed on the retromolar pad of the patient (Figure 12-1). This usually stimulates the swallowing reflex and gives the child a  chance  to  coordinate  breathing  and  swallowing. Sometimes the child refuses to swallow and a pool of solution begins to form in the oro-pharynx; at that time,\nthe parent is instructed to pinch off the nose briefly to either  cause  swallowing  or  expectoration  (usually  the former).  Too  often  children  have  a  very  difficult  time coughing and managing their airway reflexes when too much solution is shot into the mouth (usually by a parent) or too rapidly administered by the doctor.\nThis technique is especially important when administering chloral hydrate, due to is mucosal irritation. It is always possible to induce a partial laryngospasm if chloral hydrate is shot off the back pharyngeal wall and bounces down around the epiglottis and laryngeal structures."

Sometimes  the disinhibition  is  exhibited  as  talkativeness,  exploratory hyperactivity in the environment, social interaction, and general silliness,  but  it  can  show  itself  as  occasionally frank agitation. This phase is usually followed by drowsiness or sleepiness and can result in sleep itself. The latter phase is not sufficiently established to the point that one can begin patient separation from the parent to start dental procedures, but does require careful monitoring clinically and with electronic monitors (e.g., pulse oximetry), depending on the growing depth of sedation.\nParents are generally dismissed before the procedure starts. Separation from the parent should not begin until approximately  45  minutes  after  its  administration,  at which time sufficient blood levels of the active metabolite  begin to prevail. The working time (depending on whether other drugs are 'on-board', the patient's level of  natural  fatigue,  and  the  child  characteristics  such as temperament and cognitive development) is usually 60 minutes or more.\nIt should be noted that clinical technique and protocol are  very  important  throughout  the  entire  treatment. Many clinicians use oral premedication sedation together with nitrous oxide sedation; details of its administration and use have been described in the preceding chapter. Following the placement of the nasal mask, begin with slow, deliberate movements to open the airway. Point the chin of a supine patient toward the ceiling. The clinician can distract the child with chatter using a low voice if the child  is  awake.  Following  proper  titration  of  nitrous oxide  concentration  and  flow,  gently  open  the  mouth slightly, insert a mouth prop, and slowly open the mouth wider.  After  reviewing  and  confirming  the  planned treatment, topical and local anesthesia are administered. Chapter Eight describes in detail the administration of local anesthesia. If the child becomes agitated during the injection, the clinician should 're-settle' the child once local anesthetic is administered.\nA rubber dam or a comparable method (e.g., Isolite, but  not  cotton  roll  isolation  or  no  isolation)  should always  be  used  for  sedations.  Generally,  one  can  cut teeth dry or use a very light water spray that is rapidly suctioned  from  the  mouth  with  high-speed  suction. (Note: the high-speed suction should initially be activated at some distance from the patient and slowly brought closer so as to not startle the patient.) The same is true for the overhead lamp. Activate it away from the patient's face and slowly adjust it to illuminate the  mouth.  Tooth  preparation  can  begin  once  adequate anesthesia is obtained. When working efficiently the restorative phase can be completed quickly, although occasionally a child may become agitated and need to be re-settled. If this sequence of events is followed, and the patient begins the procedure in a non-agitated state, it usually results in a good  sedation outcome.  This procedure can also be followed with other sedatives.\nOne of the earlier chloral hydrate studies was that of Anderson in 1960. He used chloral hydrate alone when providing dental care to children. Anderson advocated the use of chloral hydrate to 'make a difficult, emotional patient easy to work on' and to help with patient tolerance.  He  indicated  that  up  to  5  teaspoons  (1200  mgs) was necessary for some three- to four-year-old patients 30 minutes before dental treatment. He reported on 300 patients' sedations, indicating that often local anesthesia was  unnecessary  and  all  dental  treatment  could  be accomplished in one appointment. Other studies using chloral hydrate as the single agent or with nitrous oxide have also been reported (Barr et al. 1977; Houpt et al. 1985; Moore et al. 1984). Most of the studies indicate that chloral  hydrate  produces  good  to  excellent  sedations. However, chloral hydrate currently is rarely used as a single agent for children during dental procedures."

These  studies  have been included in the references at the end of the chapter. The  dosage  range  used  in  these  studies  for  chloral hydrate and hydroxyzine is 40-75 mg/kg and 1.0 mgs to 2  mg/kg,  respectively.  There  is  some  support  to  the expectation that the addition of hydroxyzine to chloral hydrate improves patient behavior, compared to chloral hydrate  alone  (Avalos-Arenas  et  al.  1998),  but  others have found no improvement (Needleman et al. 1995).\nPromethazine has also been a popular agent as a sedative with antihistaminic properties that has been used with chloral hydrate (Dallman et al. 2001; Houpt et al. 1985; Lu and Lu 2006; Robbins 1967; Sams et al. 1993; Sams and Russell 1993; Wright and McAulay 1973). Its dose has been reported in these studies by body weight (1  mg/kg) and as a single bolus (12.5 mg). Blood pressure may be slightly lower in this combination compared to\nTable 12-1. Chloral Hydrate.\nUsually one's sedation goals are the first two depths of sedation of the AAPD guidelines (i.e., minimal and moderate sedation). However, in small uncooperative children the optimal level of sedation is that of very light sleep from which one can be easily aroused with minimal verbal or tactile stimulation. The therapeutic dose range that usually produces this type of effect when used alone in the majority of children is 30-50 mg/kg of body weight. This dose also can cause hypotonicity of the tongue muscles, causing it to fall backward against the posterior oro-pharyngeal structures. Appropriate patient monitoring (pulse oximetry and capnography) is necessary due to possible airway compromise, which may be caused by hypotonicity of glossal muscles; deep sleep and/or some respiratory depression may occur.\nChloral hydrate (Sedative-hypnotic) Contraindications: Hypersensitivity Hepatic or renal impairment Severe cardiac disease Gastritis Esophagitis Gastric ulcers, Mechanism of Action = Central nervous system depressant effects are primarily due to its active metabolite trichloroethanol, mechanism unknown..

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Perspective\nChloral  hydrate  has  also  been  used  in  combination with  meperidine  and  hydroxyzine.  This  combination has been anecdotally known as a 'triple' combination. It is still taught in advanced pediatric dentistry training programs and has remained fairly popular (Wilson and Nathan 2011). Generally, when compared to other sedatives  or  drug  combinations,  this  combination  tends  to cause improved behavior, interpreted as increased quiet and decreased crying behaviors (Chowdhury  and Vargas 2005; Hasty et al. 1991; Nathan and West 1987; Wilson et al. 2000). However, this is not always the case, as  dose  differences  or  other  similar  'triple'  combinations  have  shown  no  improvement  in  behavior  or equivalent outcomes (Poorman et al. 1990; Sheroan et al. 2006). It is possible that the dose of chloral hydrate used may make a significant difference in the behavioral outcomes, with a higher dose mediating a greater likelihood of  quiet/sleep  behaviors.  Nonetheless,  with  a  greater likelihood of quiet/sleep behaviors comes a higher risk of airway or respiratory compromise.\nThere may be an increased risk of respiratory compromise manifested as apnea and/or oxygen desaturation when the triple combination involves chloral hydrate at a dose of 50 mg/kg (Croswell et al. 1995; Leelataweedwud and Vann 2001; Leelataweewud et al. 2000; Rohlfing et al. 1998; Sheroan et al. 2006). It is possible that less respiratory compromise may result by lowering the dose of chloral hydrate and increasing that of meperidine or substituting midazolam  for  chloral  hydrate  in  the  triple  combination (Chowdhury and Vargas 2005; Sheroan et al. 2006). A summary of the characteristics, mechanism of action and dosage of chloral hydrate is presented in Table 12-1."

At  least  eighteen  studies,  have  documented meperidine combined with other sedative agents such as midazolam, hydroxyzine or promethazine, and chloral  hydrate  with  hydroxyzine.  These  studies  are included with the references at the end of this chapter. One  of  the  primary  reasons  to  use  meperidine  in combination with another sedative agent is its analgesic properties, as  most  other  agents  with  which  it  is combined, such as midazolam, usually lack such properties. Additionally, meperidine can slightly potentiate the  sedative  effect  of  another  agent  (Chowdhury  and Vargas  2005;  Nathan  and  Vargas  2002;  Wilson  et  al. 2000), and in many cases gives the impression of altering the mood of the patient.\nTable 12-2. Meperidine (Demerol, Pethidine).\nA major drawback to this agent is its likelihood to cause respiratory depression and hypotension. This is particularly true when administered parenterally, with a lessened risk anticipated when delivered via the oral route. Its use in combination with other sedatives should be carefully assessed because of the additive or synergistic properties of sedative agents.\nNarcotics, including Demerol, should be used with caution with local anesthetics. The threshold level for seizures is apparently lowered when both are used in combination.\n\nMeperidine (Narcotic) Contraindications: Hypersensitivity MAO inhibitors used within fourteen days, Mechanism of Action = Binds to opiate receptors in the CNS, causing inhibition of ascending pain pathways, altering the perception of and response to pain; produces generalized CNS depression..

The submucosal route is another popular means of administering meperidine (Cathers et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2006; Lochary et al. 1993; Roberts et al. 1992; Song and Webb 2003). One study evaluated the behavior of children  receiving  dental  care  under  sedation  with meperidine  administered  orally  versus  submucosally. There were no differences in behavior based on the route of administration (Song and Webb 2003)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Benzodiazepines\nGenerally, the onset of meperidine effects is quicker when administered submucosally, compared to oral administrations. One drawback of submucosal administration  is  that  it  can  elicit  a  hyperemic  effect often  resulting  in  a  'wheal'  and  itchiness  over  the facial area where the injection was given. These effects are indirectly triggered by histamine release from mast cells in addition to the vascular effects directly caused by exposure to meperidine (Flacke et al. 1985; Flacke et  al.  1987;  Levy  et  al.  1989).  Another  possible  side effect  of  administering  meperidine  submucosally  is that injection into a large venous complex, just distal to the  maxillary  tuberosity,  can  potentially  cause  rapid onset  of  hypotension.  Considering  these  cautions,  it seems  more  prudent  to  administer  meperidine  in therapeutic  doses  via  the  oral  route,  which  tends  to eliminate the submucosal effects. Another serious concern is potential interaction between local anesthetics and  some  narcotics,  including  meperidine.  Excessive use of either or both can result in seizures and/or death (Moore and Goodson 1985). A summary of the characteristics,  mechanism  of  action  and  dosage  of  meperidine is presented in Table 12-2.\nBenzodiazepines are a large class of drugs that tend to have a fairly wide margin of safety when used alone and in therapeutic doses. They have several properties which are beneficial to many conditions and generally cause, to relative degrees, anti-anxiety, sedative-hypnotic and anticonvulsant activity, skeletal muscle relaxation, and amnestic effects. Their mechanism of action is associated with  activation  of  the  GABA  receptor  complex,  which, when activated, has a generalized inhibitory effect. Thus, benzodiazepines  indirectly  tend  to  increase  the  inhibitory action of GABA. Although there are many benzodiazepines  on  the  market,  the  most  frequently  reported benzodiazepines  used  for  sedating  children  for  dental procedures are midazolam, diazepam, and triazolam."

It was first used as a sedative for dental treatment in the early 1990s (Roelofse and de Joubert 1990) and has been used in medicine since the early 1980s (Haas et al. 1996).

    "context_enriched_content": "Clinical Perspective\nThe sequence of behavioral events that occurs after the oral  administration  of  midazolam is  as  follows.  Slight but perceptible changes in attitude and even activity can\nbe seen within 5 minutes. In 10-15 minutes, significant relaxation occurs and increased socialization is noticeable. Sometimes the child is overcome by a more quiet but friendly mood, especially if they were initially shy or withdrawn. Somewhere between 15-20 minutes after the  child  has  received  midazolam,  separation  of  the child  from  the  parent  can  take  place.  If  nitrous  oxide is  to  be  used  as  a  co-medication,  begin  to  place  the nitrous oxide hood over the patient's nose, again using conversation as a distraction.\nAs  mentioned  previously  with  chloral  hydrate,  the same protocol is used for settling the child and starting restorative  care.  Unfortunately,  the  working  time  for midazolam is only 20-40 minutes. So midazolam, when used  alone,  can  be  used  only  for  short  dental  procedures.  Occasionally,  frank  agitation  and  paradoxical excitement  will  occur  in  a  small  fraction  of  patients, resulting in an inconsolable, unmanageable child, even in the arms of the parent. This response usually occurs immediately following or during a painful procedure. Anecdotally, this type of response has been referred to as the 'angry child syndrome.'\nMidazolam has been used alone during dental procedures  with  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  patients reportedly accepting dental treatment successfully (Erlandsson et al. 2001). Others have demonstrated midazolam's improvement in patient attitude, behavior, and general procedural outcome compared to a placebo or pre-sedation  behavior  (Gallardo  et  al.  1994;  Mazaheri et al. 2008; Wan et al. 2006).\nMidazolam  has  been  used  in combination with meperidine,  hydroxyzine,  ketamine,  chloral  hydrate, tramadol, fentanyl, sufentanil, nalbuphine, droperidol, and  acetaminophen  (Cagiran  et  al.  2010;  Heard  et  al. 2010; Milnes et al. 2000; Myers et al. 2004; Nathan and Vargas  2002;  Padmanabhan  et  al.  2009;  Reeves  et  al. 1996). Few of these studies are alike in protocol or study design; thus, it is almost impossible to determine what combination is consistently superior, if any. Nonetheless, when  another agent is added  to midazolam, the combination usually results in a slight improvement of behaviors  compared  to  midazolam  alone  (Al-Zahrani et al. 2009; Cagiran et al. 2010; Nathan and Vargas 2002; Shapira  et  al.  2004),  but  not  always.  The  improved behavior may be a function of doses (Musial et al. 2003)."

The dose range for midazolam given parenterally (i.e., via any route other than oral and rectal) is much less compared to that of the oral  route  (e.g.,  0.2-0.3  mg/kg  versus  0.5-1.0 mg/kg, respectively). As with other agents, including midazolam, a child's temperament has been shown to be associated with pharmacological outcomes. Shy or withdrawn children tend to have less favorable outcomes (Arnrup et al. 2003; Isik et al. 2010; Jensen and Stjernqvist 2002; Lochary et al. 1993; Primosch and Guelmann 2005). Usually, the first  dramatic  physiological  change,  manifested  as  a higher heart rate and disruptive behaviors, is followed by a quiet, favorable mood. Midazolam lacks analgesic properties; hence, when analgesics are used in combination with midazolam, the behavioral outcomes generally improve (Nathan and Vargas 2002).

Diazepam  produces  good  skeletal  muscle relaxation  and  anti-anxiety  effects.  It  has  a  long  onset time,  usually  approaching  one  hour  after  its  administration before a patient is ready for dental procedures. It also has a good hour of working time, and an even longer period is required before it is fully metabolized and eliminated from the body. Therefore, time to discharge may be prolonged with diazepam, and it may not be very useful in small children in a busy office setting.\nThere  are  at  least  eleven  reports  of  diazepam  used as a single agent, as well as with other sedatives. For the reader's  convenience  these  reports  are  listed  in  the references.

Most of the studies are older,  suggesting  that  rectal  administration  is  not  as popular as it has been in the past. Additionally, some of the  studies  indicated  that  midazolam  was  better  than diazepam when administered rectally. One interesting study evaluated the amnestic effect of diazepam administered  orally  (Jensen  and  Schroder  1998). Apparently, the amount of amnesia was significantly reduced in the subset of patients who exhibited behavior management problems.  Others  have  had  similar  results  (Sullivan et al. 2001). Further study needs to elucidate whether or not there is an association between disruptive behaviors in  young  children  and  amnesia  with  diazepam  and other benzodiazepines.\nDiazepam also has been used in combination with ketamine (Okamoto et al. 1992; Reinemer et al. 1996;\nTable 12-3.

    "context_enriched_content": "summary\nClinicians want to know and understand the best evidenced-based information when delivering oral health care to their patients. This orientation applies not only to a plethora of practice issues such as restorative materials and techniques, special treatments (e.g., Endodontics), dental equipment, and practice management, but also to patient management and, in particular, the management of  challenging  groups  such  as  geriatric  and  pediatric patients.  The  clinician's  desires  and  goals  for  maximizing  the  delivery  of efficient, quality care in a friendly and supportive fashion often requires the use of pharmacological  techniques  to  successfully  manage challenging  patients.  Thus,  clinicians  strive  to  find compelling  evidence  for  the  'best'  pharmacological agents to aid them in meeting their goals.\nUnfortunately,  the  amount  of  sound,  scientificallyderived  data  suggesting  a  ranking  of  agents  to  meet particular  patient  needs  and  challenges  is  woefully small. Issues such as study design with blinding and randomization, allocation of patients to groups, doseresponse effects, and even the selection of a common outcome metric become exceedingly difficult to control in  clinical  situations.  Even  though  many  decades  of clinical studies have investigated sedative agents and their effects on the behavior and physiology of patients,\nDelving into the obscure body of knowledge on sedative  agents,  a  recent  study  using  a  meta-analysis attempted  to  determine  which  sedative  agents  are effective for behavior management in children who are receiving  dental  care  (Lourenco-Matharu  et  al.  2012). The  investigators  used  multiple  electronic  databases and  hand-searched  many  journals.  They  looked  for blinded,  randomized,  and  well-controlled  sedation studies involving children ranging in age from infancy to sixteen years. Study designs using crossover procedures  were  excluded  due  to  the  possibility  of differential patient responses at future visits depending on prior experiences in an initial visit. Only thirtysix studies involving a total of slightly more than 2,000 patients met their criteria. Many of the studies had the potential for high risk of bias, and at least twenty-eight different sedatives were used with or without nitrous oxide.  The  doses,  administration  mode,  and  timing factors varied widely. Essentially they found weak evidence  for  midazolam  as  an  effective  agent  when sedating children for dental treatment, and they found that nitrous oxide may improve patient behavior when used with other sedatives. They concluded that there is a need for further study using tightly controlled study designs and possible comparison to a standard which they  interpreted  at  this  point  to  be  midazolam  and nitrous oxide.\nIt  is  the  impression  of  this  author  that  such  inquiry will require a major paradigm shift. Essential to any shift would be better use of electronic technology, agreement\non  effective,  interactive  behavior  management  principles, and support of pooled data development. Greater use of multiple site modalities such as private practice, teaching programs, and hospital collaborates is also critical to effecting change. Otherwise, for now, the 'magic bullet' will continue to be general anesthesia."

    "context_enriched_content": "Working with a Dentist anesthesiologist\nKenneth L. Reed\nAmanda Jo okundaye\nStaying in the dental office is much more convenient for both  dentists  and  patients  than  going  to  a  hospital operating room. Anesthesia and dental services may be delivered in a dental office at significantly lower costs than  in  the  hospital  operating  room.  With  health  care dollars at a premium, health care 'reform' well on its way in the United States, and more people paying out of pocket for dental services, hospital operating room use for  otherwise  healthy  pediatric  dental  patients  may decline. There now is a trend toward in-office deep sedation  and  general  anesthetics  in  some  geographical regions (Olabi et al. 2012). This chapter focuses on the reason for that trend, as well as how to work with a dentist anesthesiologist.\nAs has been described elsewhere in this text, the levels of sedation to anesthesia within medicine and dentistry are:  minimal  sedation,  moderate  sedation,  deep  sedation and general anesthesia. Both minimal sedation and moderate sedation are 'conscious' techniques. A hallmark  of  a  conscious  technique  is  that  the  patient responds to verbal commands or light tactile stimulation.  In  the  case  of  minimal  sedation,  the  patient responds normally to verbal commands or light tactile stimulation. In the case of moderate sedation, the patient responds  purposefully  to  verbal  commands  or  light tactile  stimulation.  If  minimal  to  moderate  sedation fails,  the  next  level  is  deep  sedation  or  general  anesthesia. For these levels, the pediatric dentist has to consider whether the patient will be treated in the dental office or in the hospital."

    "context_enriched_content": "educational requirements for a Dentist anesthesiologist?\nMany years ago, there were no formal requirements for dentists to be able to administer any form of sedation or anesthesia. Likewise, there were no guidelines for  dentists  in  the  area  of  sedation  and  anesthesia. The 'Guidelines for Teaching Pain Control and Sedation to Dentists and Dental Students' were first published in 1972 by the American Dental Association (ADA). In the 1985 update of the guidelines, the concept of 'deep sedation' was introduced, and training required  to  perform  this  level  of  anesthesia  was deemed  to  be  the  same  as  for  general  anesthesia (Peskin  1993).  These  documents  have  been  updated many times  since  the  original  version  and  will  continue to be updated as needed in the future.\nThe training to be licensed and permitted to administer minimal to moderate oral sedation may be obtained in  almost  all  pediatric  dental  residencies  or  through  a variety of continuing education courses. To be licensed and permitted to administer deep sedation or general anesthesia, the training may only be obtained in specific residencies  today.  The  training  requirements  for  deep sedation and anesthesia are the same. For dentists in the United States, the completion of a dental anesthesiology or oral and maxillofacial surgery residency is required in order to obtain a permit to administer general anesthesia. It is not possible to obtain training to administer deep  sedation  or  general  anesthesia  in  a  continuing education  course.  Several  pediatric  dentists  have  also completed  dental  anesthesiology  residencies,  but  the overwhelming majority of pediatric dentists have been trained only to the level of either minimal or moderate oral sedation.\nDeep sedation and general anesthesia can be considered equal to one another. Both deep sedation and general anesthesia are 'unconscious' techniques in which the patient does not respond to verbal command or light tactile stimulation. The only technical difference is that in deep sedation the patient does respond purposefully following  repeated  or  painful  stimulation,  whereas  in general anesthesia the patient cannot be aroused, even following painful stimulation. Pediatric dental patients\noften have local anesthesia administered in addition to deep sedation or general anesthesia, which muddies the difference between the two."

    "context_enriched_content": "hospital-Based versus office-Based treatment\nWhen  minimal  to  moderate  oral  sedation  fails  in  the pediatric  dental  office,  deep  sedation  or  general  anesthesia  may  be  indicated.  Many  pediatric  dentists  currently take these patients to the hospital. Consequently, patients  incur  extremely  high  costs  and  dentists  lose productive time in the office. Mass (1993) compared the costs for a typical one-hour dental case of office-based anesthesia versus hospital-based anesthesia. He found that  in  the  early  1990s  the  hospital  fee  approximated $1,900 while the office-based case would typically cost $150. As of 2009, the Albany Medical Center stated that the  cost  of  office-based  anesthesia  remained  less  than 10% of the cost of hospital-based anesthesia for dental procedures.\nThe  spread  between  hospital-based  anesthesia  and dental office-based anesthesia pricing still exists today. Rashewsky and colleagues (2012) determined that the hospital operating room expense for a pediatric dental patient was 13.2 times the expense of office-based anesthesia. At Stony Brook Medicine, dental patients requiring  treatment  with  general  anesthesia  received dental care in either an outpatient facility at the Stony Brook School of Dental Medicine or in the Stony Brook University  Hospital  ambulatory  setting.  Rashewsky examined the time and cost for ambulatory American Society  of  Anesthesiologists  (ASA)  Class  I  pediatric patients receiving full-mouth dental rehabilitation using general anesthesia in these two locations. They reviewed ninety-six patient records for ASA I patients aged 36-60 months. There were significant differences in cost, total anesthesia time, and recovery room time. The average total time (anesthesia end time minus anesthesia  start  time)  to  treat  a  child  at  Stony  Brook University Hospital under  general anesthesia  was 222 ± 62.7 minutes, and recovery time (time of discharge minus anesthesia end time) was 157 ± 97.2 minutes; the average total cost was $7,303. At the Stony Brook School of Dental Medicine, the average total time was 175 ± 36.8 minutes, and recovery time was 25 ± 12.7 minutes; the average total  cost  was  $414.  This  study  provides  evidence  that  ASA  I  pediatric  patients  can  receive  fullmouth  dental  rehabilitation  using  general  anesthesia under  the  direction  of  dentist  anesthesiologists  in  an office-based dental setting more quickly and at a lower cost  than  in  a  hospital  operating  room.  This  is  very promising  for  patients  with  the  least  access  to  care, including patients with special needs and those without insurance (Rashewsky  2012). To some  extent, the economic barrier is lowered.\nSo what are other advantages and disadvantages of treating pediatric dental patients in the hospital operating room  versus the dental office? Having provided  anesthesia services in both settings, the authors  of  this  chapter  know  both  systems  well.  To begin,  there  is  a  need  for  both  types  of  treatment. Unfortunately, the choice is often determined by what is available to the practitioner or how the practitioner was originally  trained.  Many  pediatric  dentists,  especially those trained some time ago, only consider the hospital operating room option.\nWhile the hospital operating room is safe, it is often not the most ideal place to treat many pediatric dental patients.  It  is  a  burden  for  the  pediatric  dentist  to bring all of the drugs, supplies and equipment needed for  an  operating room case. In some cases, hospitals charge a facility fee. Hospitals may not have a wide variety of surgical instruments and dental suppliesthe dentist has to use what is available. The hospital operating  room  can  also  be  inefficient.  Dental  cases are low priority electives in a medical setting, so it is not unusual for a dental case to be 'bumped' in order to place a higher priority emergent medical case in the operating room where the dental case was scheduled. Hospital operating rooms  also take a significant amount of time to 'turn over.' Cleaning and replenishing  supplies  takes  much  more  time  compared  to the typical dental office."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Dentist anesthesiologist\nThe anesthesia provider for the vast majority of hospital operating rooms will be either a physician anesthesiologist or, more commonly in the United States, a certified registered nurse anesthetist. There are few dentist anesthesiologists working in hospital operating rooms providing  anesthesia  services.  While  physicians  and nurses can and do provide safe general anesthesia, they lack an understanding of dentistry compared to a dentist anesthesiologist. Most  dentist anesthesiologists will provide intraoral local anesthesia when appropriate for the  case,  or  will  at  least  be  available  for  consultation regarding the feasibility.\nDentist anesthesiologists are comfortable with providing nasally intubated general anesthesia. Some physician  anesthesiologists  and  certified  registered nurse  anesthetists  are  less  comfortable  with  nasal intubation  and  may  offer  only  oral  intubation  or  a\nlaryngeal mask airway (LMA). Neither oral intubation nor  an  LMA  offers  the  access  to  the  oral  cavity,  the ability to check occlusion, and the all-around ability to perform ideal dentistry that a nasally intubated pediatric  dental  case  provides.  Dentist  anesthesiologists are trained as dentists first, acquiring their anesthesia training later. Dentists know dental procedures. Physician  anesthesiologists  and  certified  registered nurse  anesthetists  do  not.  Dentist  anesthesiologists understand that local anesthesia provides post-operative pain control for pediatric dental patients and that longer-acting opioids such as morphine or hydromorphone are not indicated. When physician anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists provide deep sedation or general anesthesia for pediatric dentists, they often do not understand this simple concept and sometimes administer large amounts of opioids. This  leads  to  excessively  prolonged  recovery  and unnecessary post-operative nausea and vomiting. Neither of these tends to build patient confidence, nor are they practice builders.\nDentist  anesthesiologists  are  trained  to  work  with patients  on  whom  open  airway  procedures  are  performed and are therefore much more comfortable than physician anesthesiologists and  certified registered nurse anesthetists who lack such training. Sharing the patient's airway is a normal, daily occurrence for a dentist anesthesiologist, but it is a very foreign concept to most non-dentists performing anesthesia. Most physician  anesthesiologists  and  certified  registered  nurse anesthetists are not comfortable performing anesthesia outside of a hospital operating room and are unfamiliar with mobile anesthesia practice.\nDentist anesthesiologists understand the private practice of dentistry; they understand the dental   environment and  strive  to  maintain  a  nurturing  atmosphere  when invited  to  participate  in  the  care  of  pediatric  dental patients.  The  atmosphere and expectations in hospital operating  rooms  are  quite  different  from  a  private dental office and physician anesthesiologists and certified  registered  nurse  anesthetists  often  do  not  understand this distinction. There is also one very interesting statistic  regarding  patient  safety.  Since  the  first  dental anesthesia  residency  was  established  in  1949,  when  a dentist anesthesiologist  has  provided  anesthesia  in another  dentist's  office,  there  has  not  been  a  single patient death-ever. The same cannot be said for a physician  anesthesiologist  or  a  certified  registered  nurse anesthetist. In summary, some have said that when compared to physician anesthesiologists, dentist anesthesiologists are safer, more approachable, less patronizing, and  more  understanding  of  the  dental  process  and needs of the dentist.\nAdditionally, the operating table in an operating room offers fewer options to the pediatric dentist. The ability to  place  the  operating  table  in  an  exact  location  and position is often compromised, unlike a dental chair in a dental office. Room lighting and suction are often more difficult to manipulate in an operating room, and sometimes something as simple as a saliva ejector may not be able to be accommodated."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Dentist anesthesiologist\nPediatric dental patients and their parents or guardians know the pediatric dental office; they know where it is located and they know the office staff. Taking their child  to  a  hospital  for  dental  care  can  be  daunting. Usually, they don't know the system or what to expect. The hospital is generally a less nurturing and less comfortable environment than the private office or clinic. As noted  by  Rashewsky  (2012),  patients  treated  in  the hospital  spend  much  more  time  in  non-productive activities,  such  as  prolonged  waiting  times  in  a  preoperative  holding  area  or  longer  times  in  recovery rooms, in comparison to dental office treatment. With more and more scrutiny being given to medical expenditures  in  health  care  by  insurers  and  governmental agencies,  the  use  of  the  hospital  operating  rooms  for healthy dental patients may very well become a thing of the past.\nWhile the emphasis so far has been on in-office deep sedation and anesthesia, there still remains a need for some pediatric dental patients to be seen in the hospital operating  room.  All  ASA  IV  and  ASA  V  pediatric dental patients that require dental treatment should be seen  in  the  hospital  operating  room,  as  should  most ASA III patients. Only ASA I and ASA II patients, and potentially  some  ASA  III  patients,  would  be  good candidates  for  office-based  deep  sedation  or  general anesthesia."

    "context_enriched_content": "Use of a Dentist Anesthesiologist by Pediatric Dentists\nThe  use  of  dentist  anesthesiologists  appears  to  be  an emerging  trend  in  pediatric  dental  practice  (ASDA 2010).  A  recent  paper  by  Olabi  and  associates  (2012) found that 20-40% of board-certified pediatric dentists currently  use  a  dentist  anesthesiologist,  and  60-70% would  use a dentist anesthesiologist if one were available. The utilization rate appears to be regional. For example,  in  the  northeast  United  States,  only  12%  of board-certified pediatric dentists use a dentist anesthesiologist, yet 46% of that same group would use a   dentist anesthesiologist if one were available. However, 59% of board-certified pediatric dentists practicing in the western United States currently use the services of a dentist anesthesiologist, and 78% indicated that they would use\na dentist anesthesiologist if possible. It is also interesting to note that from a regional perspective, the southwest had  the  highest  percentage  of  respondents  reporting that they administered some form of in-office sedation (88%), employed the services of a dentist anesthesiologist (59%), and would use a dentist anesthesiologist if one were available (78%). Finally, a novel finding of this study was that female board-certified pediatric dentists were  more  likely  to  employ  a  dentist  anesthesiologist than their male counterparts.\nBased  on  the  data  of  the  foregoing  study,  it  is apparent that dentist anesthesiologist availability is a major  impediment  to  increasing  the  number  of  deep sedation and general anesthetics in dental offices. To understand  the  problem,  some  understanding  of  the history  is  needed.  It  was  realized  in  the  1950s  that  a specialty of anesthesia in dentistry would benefit the profession.  Concomitantly,  the  department  of  dental anesthesiology at the Tokyo  Medical and Dental University was created by Dr. Tadashi Ueno (Matsuura 1993). In 1953, the American Dental Society of Anesthesiology (ADSA) was formed (Peskin 1993) and the first application for specialty status was submitted to the ADA (Allen 1992). Unfortunately for dentistryand  more  importantly  dental  patients-this  application was unsuccessful.\nThe  next  major  event  affecting  the  administration  of anesthesia by dentists was in the early 1980s. Physicians drew a metaphorical line in the sand. As a portion of a policy statement in 1982, The  American  Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) wrote that 'anesthesia care is the practice of medicine.' As a consequence, dentists administering anesthesia could be accused by state medical boards of practicing medicine without a license. Fortunately, by 1987 the ASA had published a more reasonable statement: 'The  ASA  recognizes  the  right  of  qualified  dentists  as defined by the American Dental Association to administer conscious sedation, deep sedation and general anesthesia to patients having dental procedures only.'\nThe ASA recognition has allowed the anesthesia specialty  to  mature.  In  2007  the  Commission  on  Dental Accreditation  (CODA)  published  a  Standards  document entitled  'Advanced  Dental  Education  Programs in Dental Anesthesiology.' Hence, standards now exist for  accredited  dental  anesthesia  residencies.  The  standards are stringent. Residents must perform a minimum of  500  deep  sedations  and  general  anesthetics,  200  of which  must  be  intubated  general  anesthetics,  and  at least  50  of  which  must  be  nasotracheal  intubations. Twenty cases must incorporate advanced airway techniques such as fiber-optic intubation or laryngeal mask airway. A minimum of 100 cases must be for children age six or younger, and fifty cases must be for specialneeds patients.\nAccording to a 2007 editorial by Dr. Joel Weaver, three major benefits to the dental profession will be derived from  the  accreditation  of  dentist  anesthesiologist  residency programs. They are as follows."

They  should  now  recognize that future dentist anesthesiologists must be graduates of CODA-accredited training programs to be eligible for anesthesia permits-with, of course, traditional grandfathering  for  those  who  completed  training  prior  to accreditation.\nAccreditation helped to provide increased support for more  residents  and  residency  programs  to  meet  the need and demand. In 2007, there were roughly 200 dentist  anesthesiologists  in  the  United  States.

Most dentist anesthesiologists in the United States are 'mobile'; that is, they bring  all  of  their  drugs,  supplies,  and  equipment  with them when they travel to a pediatric dental office to provide anesthesia services. Figure 13-1 demonstrates a dentist anesthesiologist's typical 'mobile' setup. Figure 13-2 shows the dentist anesthesiologist's drugs, supplies, and equipment  in  a  dental  office,  providing  general  anesthesia for a pediatric dental patient.\nFigure 13-1. A dentist anesthesiologist's typical 'mobile' setup.\nFigure 13-2. The dentist anesthesiologist's drugs, supplies and equipment in a dental office, providing general anesthesia for a pediatric dental patient.\nThe usual procedure for involving a dentist anesthesiologist  is  as  follows.  The  pediatric  dentist  arranges  a day for the dentist anesthesiologist to be in the office. A number of cases are scheduled to make the day more efficient for both doctors. A few days before the treatment day, the office provides a copy of the schedule with patient data to the anesthesiologist,  who  typically reviews the medical history as collected by the pediatric dentist and phones the parent or caregiver at least one day prior to the anesthetic. Further questioning about the  medical  history  of  the  child  occurs  at  that  time. Contact information for physicians or other health care providers  may  be  obtained  if  consultation  with  the patient's physician is indicated. Financial arrangements are discussed with the parent. During the pre-operative phone call, NPO ( nihil per os ; nothing by mouth) requirements  are  relayed,  as  well  as  any  other  pre-operative instructions,  such  as  which  medications  to  take  and which to withhold. The dentist anesthesiologist explains to the  parent  what  to  expect.  For  pre-cooperative pediatric patients or uncooperative patients with special needs,  it  is  especially  important  to  inform  the  parent or  caregiver  on  the  method  of  induction  of  general anesthesia and what is expected from them."

Parenteral  anxiety (fear of a needle) is actually the biggest contribution to the anxiety of the child. When a premedication is chosen, the oral route is by far the most common. Furthermore, a benzodiazepine is the most common class of drug for orally administered premedication prior to deep sedation or general anesthesia, and the specific benzodiazepine  is  most  often  midazolam.  Midazolam  provides some degree of amnesia, is an anxiolytic agent, and has a very shallow dose response curve, which translates to a very wide margin of safety."

    "context_enriched_content": "Induction of Deep Sedation or General Anesthesia\nAn IV induction is the safest and most effective method of inducing deep sedation or general anesthesia. Ideally, the  patient  will  allow  an  IV  to  be  started.  Some  older children  and  higher  functioning  patients  with  special needs will  allow  it.  If  a  lack  of  cooperation  precludes starting  an  IV,  there  are  two  primary  methods  of inducing  deep  sedation  or  general  anesthesia.  Some dentist anesthesiologists prefer an induction with intramuscular (IM) drugs. Most often the IM drug of choice is ketamine, with or without midazolam and/or glycopyrrolate. The other primary method of inducing general\nanesthesia  to  an  uncooperative  dental  patient  is  a 'mask'  induction.  This  technique  uses  an  inhaled volatile general anesthetic gas, most often sevoflurane. Sevoflurane really isn't  used  to  induce  deep  sedation, only general anesthesia. Some dentist anesthesiologists have both sevoflurane and ketamine available and use each  technique  for  different  situations,  while  others exclusively use one over the other.\nThose  that  prefer  a  mask  induction  generally  agree that it saves the patient the injection experience. Conversely,  those  who  prefer  IM  induction  hold  that pediatric  patients  receive  inoculations  on  a  regular basis-this  is  simply  one  more  'shot,'  and  they  will have more in the future. Those that criticize mask inductions say that holding a child down and forcing a mask on them, especially if the patient is claustrophobic, is less than ideal. Others will point out that in the more cooperative pediatric dental patient who participates in holding the  mask,  the  induction  can  be  stress-free.  Based  on personal experiences, there is no right or wrong way to induce general anesthesia in the pediatric dental patient.\nOnce deep sedation or general anesthesia is induced, the vast majority of dentist anesthesiologists will establish IV access.  Having an IV allows administration of additional drugs, if needed, and it provides immediate access should emergency drug administration become necessary."

    "context_enriched_content": "Airways\nAn open airway is defined as an airway that is not intubated or secured with an adjunct such as a nasoendotracheal tube or laryngeal mask. Open airway anesthesia  is  performed  daily  for  all  levels  of  anesthesia and has been performed safely for many years and  taught  in  many  pediatric  dental  residency  programs in the United States. The literature does not provide a sufficient reason for open airway versus intubated anesthetics. Instead, it is left up to the anesthesiologist, whose training and comfort level will dictate  the  choice.  Any  level  of  sedation  administered should include a throat pack or oral partition. It is our recommendation that during open airway cases, practitioners should use water judiciously if it is required, as  well  as  a  rubber  dam  to  decrease  the  amount  of debris that goes in the throat pack or oropharynx. The throat pack is placed in the oropharynx to (1) protect contents  from  going  down  the  airway  and  causing possible  complications  such  as  a  laryngospasm  and (2) prevent or reduce the escape of gases directly into the face of the operator.\nWhen working in a pediatric dental office, the type of airway  is  often  debated  by  dentist  anesthesiologists. Some strongly  prefer  an  'open  airway'  for  all  procedures, feeling that the patient can be kept at a lighter plane of anesthesia than with advanced airway manipulation.  They  contend  that  induction  and  recovery  are faster  in  short  cases  with  an  open  airway.  However, a patent airway must be maintained at all times and often either the pediatric dentist, dentist anesthesiologist, or dental assistant will manipulate the airway for at least a portion  of  the  procedural  time.  Fewer  supplies  and equipment  are  also  necessary  in  an  open  airway  case than one which requires more aggressive airway manipulation. Both deep sedation and general anesthesia may be accomplished with open airway techniques.\nOther dentist anesthesiologists prefer a more secure airway, even though it requires a deeper level of anesthesia. Nasotracheal intubation for general anesthesia is  considered  by  some  to  be  the  'gold  standard'  for dental  cases.  With  experience  and  good  technique,  it only takes a few seconds to a couple of minutes longer to place the tube. An advantage is that with the secure airway, mandible position and the use of water spray are no concern. If a nasotracheal tube is used, the resultant anesthetic is always general anesthesia, not deep sedation. If the plan is to maintain the anesthetic on a volatile agent such as sevoflurane, some type of advanced airway will be necessary. For a dental procedure in which some degree of airway protection other than an  endotracheal  tube  is  desired,  a  flexible  laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be chosen (Figure 13-3). The LMA  offers  a  more  protected  airway  than  a  simple throat partition as used in an open airway technique, but it does not offer the same level of protection as an endotracheal  tube.  Additionally,  occlusion  may  be checked  and  a  variety  of  other  dental  manipulations performed in cases of an open airway or nasoendotracheal  tube,  where  these  same  things  may  not  easily be accomplished under LMA  general anesthesia. Technically, deep sedation may be used with an LMA; however,  the  resultant  level  if  an  LMA  is  used  will always be true general anesthesia."

    "context_enriched_content": "Maintenance of General Anesthesia\nOnce the patient is induced, IV access is secured, and the airway of choice is established, the next decision is determining how to maintain general anesthesia. Again, there are  two  main  options.  One  is  to  maintain  general  anesthesia with IV drugs and the other is to maintain general anesthesia  with  inhaled  general  anesthetic  gas.  Maintenance with IV agents has a number of advantages. There is no concern of 'gas hygiene' and pollution of the dental operatory with waste anesthetic gases. The equipment used to administer the IV medications is typically a small, lightweight infusion pump, and the drugs used most often are propofol  with  remifentanil  or  alfentanil.  Each  of  these drugs  have  a  very  short  clinical  duration  of  action,  and therefore have a rapid emergence from general anesthesia. Propofol is also a great antiemetic agent when exerting its effects, so post-operative nausea and vomiting are extremely rare. Other agents may be administered through\nFigure 13-3.

Sevoflurane is a good all-around inhalational general anesthetic. It is the most desirable for an inhalational induction, as it is least irritating to the pulmonary system and has an inoffensive odor. It works rapidly and has a relatively quick offset.\nAnother  benefit  of  inhalational  anesthetics  is  that, generally speaking, there has never been a shortage, nor have prices escalated as they have with most IV drugs. In  2013,  every  drug  used  in  anesthesia  for  dentistry has been in short supply or on back order at least once, and  the  price  of  most  IV  drugs  used  in  anesthesia for dentistry has increased from two to ten-fold over a"

The pediatric patient is allowed to regain consciousness and recover completely. For the patient that had an open airway deep sedation or general anesthetic, the throat partition is simply removed and oxygen continued most often via nasal cannula.\nThere are different schools of thought on the proper time to extubate those patients that were intubated. Deep extubation has merit, as does conscious extubation, and each may be used on different patient populations or for different reasons. Deep extubation is performed during emergence  when  the  child  is  deeply  anesthetized  and  will not  respond  to  the  endotracheal  tube  being  removed.\nConscious  or  awake  extubation  is  when  the  tube  is removed once a patient opens their eyes, lifts their head for five seconds, and breathes spontaneously with no residual muscle relaxant on board. It is still debated whether deep extubation versus awake extubation is the preferable technique  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  emergencies  on  emergence  from  anesthesia.  Regardless  of  the  technique,  the overall incidence of adverse events is similar.\nOnce the patient has regained consciousness, they are observed for a period of time until they may be safely dismissed. For some deep sedation patients, that may be as  short  a  time  period  as  ten  minutes,  while  for  other pediatric dental patients and those who experienced a general anesthesia, the recovery time may exceed one hour.  Pediatric  dental  patients  usually  recover  fairly quickly from deep sedation or general anesthesia in the dental office, and they recover without significant upset or  discomfort  in  the  majority  of  cases.  These  patients have complete amnesia from shortly after the IM injection  or  mask  induction  through  part  of  the  recovery period.  They  generally  experience  no  trauma  directly related to the anesthesia."

    "context_enriched_content": "the Use of general anesthesia in Behavior Management\nMarcio A. da Fonseca\nTravis Nelson\nMost  children  can  receive  dental  treatment  through non-pharmacologic  behavior  management.  However, some may benefit from pharmacologic adjuncts, such as general anesthesia (GA). GA is defined as a controlled state of  unconsciousness  accompanied  by  a  loss  of  protective reflexes, including the ability to maintain an airway independently and respond purposefully to physical stimulation and verbal commands  (American  Academy  of Pediatric Dentistry 2012). It does not require cooperation from the patient, and thus may be desirable in select cases (Table 14-1). GA allows delivery of dental care in a way that protects the developing psyche and promotes the establishment of a lifelong therapeutic relationship (Nelson 2013).\nDentists  feel  that  today's  children  exhibit  more  challenging behaviors than in the past, which has created an increased demand for advanced behavior management, such as sedation and GA (Casamassimo et al. 2002, Wilson 2004).  In  a  2004  US  study,  38%  of  pediatric  dentists reported using GA services more often than they did in the  previous  five  years,  and  31%  indicated  that  they would likely  increase  its  use  in  the  near  future  (Adair et al. 2004). Similarly, a recent retrospective study of specialty  pediatric  dental  care  in  Sweden  showed  that  the percentage of patients treated under GA has nearly doubled  over  the  past  twenty-five  years  (Klingberg  et  al. 2010). GA used to be one of the least desirable behavior management  techniques,  but  over  time  parents  have come  to  exhibit  high  levels  of  acceptance,  with  most agreeing to have their child treated in the operating room (OR) again if  necessary  (Savanheimo  et  al.  2005,  Eaton et al. 2005, Amin et al. 2006). However, some   parents may struggle to accept GA for their child's dental care, blaming themselves for placing the child at such risk (Amin et  al.  2006).  When  the  original  edition  of  this  book was published, GA for dentistry was mostly done as an in-patient  hospital  procedure.  In  developed  countries, procedures under GA can now be safely accomplished at an outpatient surgical facility or a dental office, leading to a  short  recovery  period,  no  overnight  stay,  and  lower costs than in a hospital. However, in many countries GA is not performed outside the OR due to regulatory practices (Wilson and Alcaino 2011). The increased acceptance of dental care under GA may be explained by the public's familiarity with surgery provided on an outpatient basis. To accommodate this shift in practice, it is not uncommon to  find  dental  anesthesiologists  (i.e.,  dentists  who  have received  formal  training  in  anesthesiology)  and  nurse anesthetists  working  in  the  United  States  (Hicks  et  al. 2012).  Unfortunately,  patients  from  low-  and  middleincome countries face significant financial, cultural and structural barriers to access GA services, including distance to a surgical center; poor roads; lack of transportation;  lack  of  facilities,  equipment,  and  expertise;  direct and  indirect  costs  related  to  surgical  care;  and  fear  of undergoing GA (Grimes et al. 2011)."

Complications may include sore throat (14-64%), nausea  and  vomiting  (20-30%),  damage  to  the  teeth (6.9%),  and  conscious  awareness  during  the  procedure (0.1-0.7%) (Jenkins and Baker 2003). Sleeping irregularities, vomiting, disruption of bodily functions, diarrhea, sore  throat,  bleeding,  and  mild  to  moderate  pain  are usually  not  significant  enough  to  warrant    medical attention (Mayeda and Wilson 2009), with most patients returning  to  their  normal  behavior  within  24  hours (Needleman et al. 2008, Mayeda and Wilson 2009, Costa et al. 2011). For healthy individuals, the chance of death solely  related  to  GA  is  estimated  at  approximately 1:100,000,  increasing  5-10  times  for  high-risk  patients and for emergency surgery (Jenkins and Baker 2003).\nTable 14-1.

    "context_enriched_content": "Informed Consent\nWhen  preparing  a  family  for  GA,  it  is  important  to ensure that caregivers have enough information to make informed decisions. The dentist can facilitate this process  through  informed  consent  (IC).  Unfortunately, studies of IC for GA show that parents often feel they are not adequately informed of its risks (Patel 2004, Shahid et al. 2008). In societies with a large influx of immigrants, cultural influences and language fluency must be taken into  consideration  when  obtaining  consent.  Trained interpreters  who  have  an  understanding  of  cultural norms  are  very  helpful  in  these  situations.  Family members,  especially  children,  should  not  be  used  as interpreters. When children interpret, there is a reversal of  power  between  them  and  their  caretakers.  Family members  may  also  choose  not  to  translate  sensitive information,  leading  to  potentially  serious  misunderstandings.  It  is  crucial  that  the  IC  form  and  the  preoperative instruction paperwork  be  written  in  the language spoken by the legal guardians. Although IC must be obtained from an adult in pediatric dentistry, it  is  important  to  consider  the  child's  participation, or assent, in the process. Children between the ages of eight  and  thirteen  years  have  shown  a  desire  to  be involved  in  discussions  regarding  their  care  and  are highly  satisfied  with  the  treatment  they  receive  when they are involved (Adewumi et al. 2001)."

    "context_enriched_content": "History And Physical Examination\nTo prevent problems during the delivery of GA, the dentist must gather a detailed medical history for the child and decide which venue is appropriate for the surgery, given  the  patient's  health  status.  For  example,  if  the child is healthy, then dental care under GA is safe to be carried  out  at  an  outpatient  facility.  If  the  child  has severe  systemic  disease,  treatment  should  be  done where there is ample and immediate medical care available  to  support  an  emergency  situation.  All  patients must undergo a history and physical examination (H&P) within  thirty  days  of  the  procedure.  For  healthy  children, it is not uncommon to have the exam done by the anesthesiologist on the day of the surgery. Given their higher  risk  for  complications,  patients  with  special health care needs should have the H&P done by a physician  who  is  thoroughly  familiar  with  their  health issues. It is imperative that the dentist discuss concerns related to the delivery of dental care with the physician and  the  anesthesiologist  to  anticipate  complications (e.g., bleeding in a child with hemophilia). To facilitate comprehensive  planning,  many  hospitals  have  a  preanesthesia evaluation service in which all involved parts are  consulted  so  that  the  patient,  family,  physicians, anesthesia care team, and dentist understand how the child will be cared for."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preoperative Pain Management\nPediatric patients experience pain with equal or greater intensity  as  their  adult  counterparts  (Cramton  and Gruchala 2012). Dentists should educate themselves on accurate assessment of pain, as well as pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods of pain management. When  that  is not adequate, the child may  suffer long-term consequences regarding future pain reactions (Cramton and Gruchala 2012).\nA substantial percentage of children may experience moderate  pain  or  worse  following  procedures  under GA.  Even  though  post-operative  pain  is  the  most common parental concern, many patients do not receive adequate  analgesia  (American  Academy  of  Pediatrics 2001,  Atan  et  al.  2004).  Health  care  professionals  and\nparents under-medicate children post-operatively, often due to misconceptions (Rony et al. 2010, Cramton and Gruchala 2012). Socio-economic status also seems to  influence  pain  perception,  with  parents  who  have less  education  being  more  likely  to  report  post-procedural  pain  for  their  children  (Needleman  et  al.  2008). Therefore, good post-operative pain control starts before surgery. Providing tailored interventions to improve a caretaker's  knowledge  of  analgesia  at  an  earlier  stage and allowing ample time for discussion may improve parental attitude (Rony et al. 2010, Jensen 2012)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preoperative Child Anxiety\nAlthough GA is typically a humane and effective way to provide dental care, the surgical experience may have a negative psychological effect on some children. Between 50%  and  75%  of pediatric patients  who  undergo ambulatory surgery in the United States each year experience  significant  fear  and  anxiety  (Kain  et  al.  1996c, Kotiniemi et al. 1997, Tzong et al. 2012). Thus, the anesthesia care team should anticipate and treat anxiety as part of the OR experience.\nPreoperative  fear  may  result  from  a  child's  concerns about separation, pain, disfigurement, loss of loved ones, and loss of control or autonomy. Alterations of the family's routine, wearing unfamiliar clothing (i.e, surgical gowns), and experiencing unknown equipment, sights, sounds, and smells also increase stress (Justus et al. 2006). Anxiety  frequently  causes  resistance  to  the  anesthesia mask,  prolongs  induction,  and  may  require  physical restraint of the child. Children may have specific fears of the mask (e.g., inability to breathe, claustrophobia, concerns about dying or not waking up), aversion (dislike of the feel or odor of the mask), and/or a true phobia (an irrational fear of the mask) (Przybylo et al. 2005, Aydin et al. 2008). Furthermore, a complex interplay of genetic and  environmental  influences  determines  how  each child will respond to the OR experience. Shyness, passive coping style, high baseline anxiety, high parental anxiety, previous upsetting surgical experiences, and male gender are factors associated with anxiety and disruptive behavior in relation to the GA visit (Melamed et al. 1988, Quinonez et al. 1997, Kain et al. 2000b). Age should also be considered, as children between the ages of one and five years appear to be at highest risk for developing significant  anxiety  before  surgery  (Lumley  et  al.  1993, Kain et al. 1996b, c).\nOther factors that may contribute to increased levels of anxiety include many people present during induction,  a  long  waiting  time  between  arrival  at  the facility  and  induction,  having  a  mother  who  does  not practice a religion, and negative memories of hospital experiences (Wollin et al. 2003). Playing at home with an anesthesia  mask  was  shown  to  relieve  mask-related anxiety,  improving  its  acceptance  and  shortening  the induction period (Aydin et al. 2008)."

Up to 25% of children cry, scream, try to avoid the anesthesia mask, and/or require restraint (Lumley  et  al.  1993,  Kain  et  al.  1999).  The  principal pharmacological  approach  to  facilitate  induction  of fearful  patients  is  the  use  of  sedative  premedication. While  other  agents  are  available,  midazolam  is  the most  extensively  researched  pre-induction  sedative, showing an effective anxiety reduction in the one to ten year age group, especially the most anxious children  (Kain  et  al.  2004).  It  may  also  cause  amnesia, which  is  desirable  should  the  induction  prove  to  be difficult (Stewart et al. 2006). However, a paradoxical negative response to midazolam may occur, especially in children  with  impulsive  temperament  (Roelofse and  Joubert  1990, Wright  et  al.  2007).  Midazolam may also cause delay in anesthetic emergence, recovery, and   discharge as well as an increase in anxiety immediately  following  surgery  (Viitanen  et  al.  1999a,  b, Wright et al. 2007)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parental Presence During Induction\nThe practice of allowing parents to be present for their child's  induction  is  a  highly  debated  topic.  Suggested benefits of parental presence include eliminating separation anxiety, minimizing premedication use, increasing child cooperation, enhancing parental satisfaction, fulfilling  parents'  perceived  sense  of  duty  to  be  present, and  enhancing  parental  satisfaction  with  the  medical care  provided  (Kain  et  al.  2003,  Wright  et  al.  2007). Anesthesia care teams in the United States have increasingly allowed parental presence at induction (Kain et al. 2004). The presence of a calm parent is typically beneficial  for  an  anxious  child,  whereas  an  anxious  parent does not improve child behavior (Cameron et al. 1996, Kain et al. 1996a, Kain et al. 2006). Unfortunately, those who  most  desire  to  be  present  have  higher  levels  of anxiety  and  tend  to  have  more  anxious  children  than parents  who  are  not  as  interested  in  participation  at induction (Caldwell-Andrews et al. 2005). When provided in the right context, both premedication and parental  presence  appear  to  improve  child  behavior\n(Kain et al. 1996c, Kain et al. 2000a). However, it should be recognized that some parents may  experience unpleasant  feelings  related  to  the  child's  induction (Mayeda and Wilson 2009)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preoperative Preparation Programs\nThe goal of these programs is to provide information for  the  patient  and  the  caretakers  about  the  process (through OR tours, print materials, audiovisual methods, websites), model the experience (using videos or puppet shows), and teach coping strategies (with  Child  Life  counselors),  using  age-appropriate language  and  imagery  (Wright  et  al.  2007).  Children who  receive  these  interventions  tend  to  exhibit  less pre-surgical anxiety, even upon separation from their parents  (Kain  and  Caldwell-Andrews  2005,  Wright et al. 2007). Many factors should be considered when selecting a program,  one of the most  important being the child's age. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive  development,  children  from  three  to  six years  (the  preoperational  stage  of  development)  are not able to think logically: thus, preoperative preparation may have negative effects for them (Brewer et al. 2006).  In  contrast,  children  from  seven  to  seventeen years have a strong desire for and benefit from comprehensive  information,  including  details  on  postoperative pain (Kain et al. 1996b, Fortier et al. 2009). Timing of preparation is also important-- the patient must  be  allowed  to  adequately  process  what  was discussed.  Children  younger  than  six  years  should receive preparation no more than one week in advance, while  older  children  benefit  most  if  they  are  given information more than five days before surgery (Perry et al. 2012). Children with a history of surgical procedures  who  did  not  benefit  from  modeling  and  play programs should be enrolled in  programs  that  teach coping  skills  before  their  next  GA  procedure  (Kain et al. 1996b, Kain et al. 2005).\nParental anxiety is a significant risk factor for child anxiety; thus, caretakers should also receive preoperative information. Preparation may be even more critical  in  day  surgery  than  for  inpatient  procedures. Parents  whose  children  will  have  outpatient  surgery experience  greater  anxiety  because  the  surgery  unit provides little time to become accustomed to its environment (Mishel 1983). Caretakers who participate in pre-surgical  programs  exhibit  decreased  anxiety  and show  higher  levels  of  satisfaction  with  the  overall quality of care (Chan and Molassiotis 2002, Felder-Puig et  al.  2003).  Unfortunately,  the  benefits  of  these  programs do not appear to extend to high-stress periods such  as  anesthetic  induction,  recovery,  or  even  at  2 weeks  postoperatively  (Kain  et  al.  1996b,  Kain  and Caldwell-Andrews 2005, Wright et al. 2007)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preoperative Dental and Surgical Plan\nGiven the high costs and possible complications of GA, and the fact that most children treated in the OR are high caries risk, an aggressive treatment approach is usually advocated.  For  example,  using  stainless  steel  crowns (SSC) for full coronal coverage in teeth with extensive decalcification  should  be  considered.  In  dental  care under GA, SSCs have a significantly lower failure rate than amalgams, while composites and composite strip crowns  have  the  highest  failure (Tate et al. 2002, Al-Eheideb and Herman 2003, Drummond et al. 2004). The tentative treatment plan should consider all potential  scenarios,  parental  compliance with oral care, and longevity of the restorations.\nThe family must understand that the plan may change on  the  day  of  the  procedure,  particularly  if  no  recent radiographs are available or if there is a long waiting period to schedule the OR visit. All possible treatments should be discussed in detail, including the appearance of  the  proposed  materials,  so  as  not  to  take  the  caretakers by surprise after the procedure is complete. For example,  if  crowns  are  planned  for  the  maxillary  primary incisors, it is wise to make the family aware that the teeth may need to be extracted if they are found to be abscessed  or  if  too  little  tooth  structure  remains  after caries  removal.  Additionally,  financial  issues,  such  as the potential need for pre-authorization from the medical and dental insurance companies, must be addressed."

Fasting is crucial to reduce the severity of complications related to perioperative pulmonary aspiration of gastric content, to avoid delays or cancellation of the procedure, to decrease risk of dehydration or hypoglycemia from prolonged fasting, and to minimize perioperative morbidity  such  as  aspiration  pneumonia  and  respiratory disabilities (Apfelbaum et al. 2011).The time and location  of  the  appointment,  and  payment  and  surgical pre-authorization information should also be reviewed.

Some  surgical  centers  will  give the child a surgical gown, while others allow the child to be induced in their own clothes. A staff person, usually  a  nurse,  takes  the  vital  signs,  height,  and  weight, and inquires about fasting and whether anything has  changed  since  the  H&P  was  completed,  such  as recent colds or asthma attacks. If the patient has a fever, wheezing, cough, runny nose, or has been exposed to a contagious or infective disease, the procedure may be cancelled. If the patient has violated the fasting recommendations, the procedure may be either cancelled or postponed to a later time on the same day to allow for emptying of gastric contents.\nOnce the admission assessment is complete, the anesthesiologist meets with the family in order to:\n1. prepare  the  patient  for  anesthesia,  determine  the child's health status and prescribe a plan of care;\n2. evaluate  tonsil  size  (Brodsky  1989)  and  potential intubation issues (Mallampati et al. 1985);\n3. determine that the fasting requirements have been followed;\n4. assess the need for a pre-operative sedative;\n5. discuss  placement  of  an  intravenous  (IV)  line  for fluid  maintenance,  route  of  intubation,  anesthetic agents, and the periand post-operative pain management plan;\n6. review the risks and management of complications related to GA;\n7. obtain  GA  consent  (the  legal  guardians  should  be given time to read the form and ask questions before signing it);\n8. determine whether the caretakers will be allowed to be present during the induction phase and how the separation is to take place. In case their presence is allowed, they must be told the order in which the events  will  occur,  the  normal  physiological  and emotional  reactions  the  child  may  display,  what they  will  be  expected  to  do,  and  when  they  will leave the room.\nAfter the anesthesia evaluation, the pre-operative sedative (if warranted) is ordered for the nurse to administer right away. The dentist then meets with the family and child to review the preliminary treatment plan. Once all questions are clarified, the dental consent form can be signed. Questions about post-operative diet and dental pain management  can  be  deferred  until after the treatment  is  completed.  Many  parents  inquire  about whether the dentist will come out to discuss the clinical findings before starting the procedure. To keep the child under GA for the least amount of time to decrease risks and costs, it is better to do so only if there is an unusual finding that may alter the treatment plan significantly or if further consent is necessary. A pre-operative progress note should be written in the patient's chart, documenting the encounter."

After  GA  induction,  which  is  most commonly done with a facial mask, is completed, the caretaker  is  escorted  out,  padding  is  placed  under pressure points, the patient is secured on the operating bed with safety straps, and an IV line is established for fluid maintenance. The most common calculation used for  fluid  therapy  in  pediatrics  is  the  '4-2-1  rule'  (Oh 1980).  Administering  either  normal  saline  or  lactated Ringer's solution is important to replace fasting deficits and  ongoing  losses  during  the  procedure  to  maintain cardiovascular stability (Murat and Dubois 2008, Bailey et al. 2010). Routine dextrose administration is no longer advised for healthy children (Bailey et al. 2010).\nIntranasal  endotracheal  intubation  is  preferred  in dentistry  because  it  leaves  more  working  room  in  the oral cavity. However, the anesthesiologist may choose to do an intraoral intubation due to difficulty passing the tube through the nares (e.g., in cases of nasal atrophy such as  seen  in  epidermolysis  bullosa  dystrophica)  or due  to  a  medical  concern  (e.g.,  causing  intranasal bleeding  in  a  child  with  hemophilia  or  rupturing  a\nrepaired cleft palate tissue flap). Patients who may present atlanto-axial instability (e.g.,  Down syndrome) or bone  fragility  (e.g.,  osteogenesis  imperfecta)  should have minimal manipulation of the neck, avoiding hyperextension during both intubation and dental care because of the high risk of fractures and/or spinal cord compression (Butler et al. 2000, Cohen 2006, Hankinson and  Anderson  2010).  Patients  with  craniofacial  syndromes also pose a great challenge for intubation, due to their limited airway access (Butler et al. 2000).\nFollowing intubation, the patient's body is draped, the eyes are protected, a shoulder roll is placed, and a towel  is  wrapped  around  the  child's  head  to  protect the  hair  from  debris  and  to  secure  the  endotracheal tube. During the procedure, the dentist must be mindful to not dislodge the endotracheal tube. A time-out should be called to identify the child one more time, introduce all staff assigned to the case and their roles, and review the anesthesia plan, the pain management plan,  and  the  dental  procedure.  The  dentist  should perform a cursory dental exam to determine the type of  radiographs  needed  (if  recent  films  are  not  available), which will be obtained next using lead protection.  A  throat  pack  should  be  placed,  followed  by  a dental cleaning and a detailed oral and dental exam to define the treatment plan. Rubber dam isolation and a mouth prop should be used throughout the procedure to  protect  the  soft  tissues,  and  all  restorative  procedures  should  be  accomplished  before  extractions  to keep the operating field as clean and dry as possible. Impressions  for  oral  appliances  can  be  taken  at  any time  during  the  procedure.  It  is  not  uncommon  to observe  intra-  and  post-operative  angioedema  of  the oral  tissues,  including  the  tongue,  due  to  sensitivity and extensive oral manipulation."

The patient may be extubated in the OR or in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), depending  on  his  status  and  the  anesthesiologist's preference.

SSCs  and  pulpotomies  cause more distress than extractions or other types of restorative work (Mayeda and Wilson 2009, Costa et al. 2011). It  is  important  to  control  pain  as  rapidly  as  possible, with analgesic doses titrated according to the patient's response.  Early  effective  treatment  is  safer  and  more efficacious than delayed  treatment, and  results in improved comfort and possibly less total administered medication. Overall, patients' discomfort is mild and of short  duration (Mayeda and Wilson 2009, Costa et al. 2011,  Jensen  2012)  and  sometimes  pain  is  not  even reported (Vinckier et al. 2001). However, more than onethird of children who receive dental care under GA may experience  moderate  to  severe  pain  (Atan  et  al.  2004, Hosey  et al. 2006). In such cases, continuous or around-the-clock  dosing  at  fixed  intervals  is  recommended. Before prescribing analgesics, it is important to confer  about  the  anesthesiologist's  pain  management plan, in order for the child to receive the correct amount of medication. Oral administration of ibuprofen alone or combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) decreased the mean pain and distress scores in children compared to paracetamol alone (Gazal and Mackie 2007). In contrast, paracetamol, ibuprofen and LA used together did not decrease distress in young children having extractions  under  GA  (McWilliams  and  Rutherford  2007). Children  who  receive  over  the  counter  analgesics  the day after the procedures show less pain in the first week (Costa et al. 2011). Sadly, parental adherence to the dentist's analgesic recommendations following extractions under GA is poor (Jensen 2012). The most commonly prescribed  analgesics  in  pediatrics  are  described  in Table 14-3.\nthe tissues to minimize discomfort at recovery, and (2) to help  control  bleeding  through  the  action  of  vasoconstrictors. LA reduced postoperative pain but increased dizziness in one study (Atan et al. 2004). In contrast, LA reduced  bleeding  but  not  pain  in  the  early  recovery period  (McWilliams  and  Rutherford  2007,  Townsend et al. 2009) and led to a higher incidence of cheek and lip biting  compared  to  children  who  did  not  receive  it (Townsend et al. 2009). The use of resorbable hemostatic sponges in the socket and/or sutures is also commonly used to control bleeding."

Families also report improvement in their QoL as a whole because of fewer parental sleep disturbances, less attention required by the child, fewer financial difficulties and fewer days off work to  attend  to  the  child's  dental  needs  (Anderson et al. 2004, Thomson and Malden 2011).\nThe other controversial issue in dental care under GA is the need for LA. In cases of oral surgical procedures, it is not unusual to inject LA for two reasons: (1) to numb\nThe  high  levels  of  parental  satisfaction  with  dental care  provided  under  GA  may  initially  lead  to  some positive behavioral changes, such as understanding the importance of a healthy primary dentition, improving dental  health  practices,  and  reducing  sugar  consumption  and  snacking  (Anderson  et  al.  2004,  Amin  et  al. 2006). However, many caretakers do not follow the preventive  advice  given  before  and  after  the  procedure (Amin and Harrison 2007, Peerbhay 2009, Olley et al. 2011). A parental sense of 'fatalism' is a major barrier to positive changes. They may feel as though they do not have the ability to control their child's oral health, which may be linked  to  factors  such  as  their  own  poor  oral\nTable 14-3.

Some do  not  see  the  importance  of  preventive  practices  at home and fail to keep appointments (Roberts et al. 1990).

Children who are anxious before surgery were found to have a 3.5 times greater risk for development of negative postoperative behavioral changes. Some problems persisted for up to one  year  in  7.3%  of  children  who  had  outpatient  GA (Kain  et  al.  1996a).  Recent  reports  indicate  that  there may be adverse neurocognitive consequences of GA in young children with developing brains. There is some controversy surrounding these findings, and the behavioral  implications  for  GA  care  are  not  yet  clear (International Anesthesia Research Society 2012). Furthermore,  having  dental  care  under  GA  does  not seem  to  improve  the  child's  previous  uncooperative behavior (Savanheimo et al. 2005, Amin and Harrison 2007, Klaassen et al. 2009), although not all studies agree (O'Sullivan and Curzon 1991, Al-Malik and Al-Sarheed 2006).

Perhaps  the  dentist  contributes  to  the  patient's  poor compliance due to a personal sense of fatalism (there is no  known  effective  prevention  for  ECC),  misconceptions  (these  parents  are  not  interested  in  their  child's oral health) and/or unrealistic expectations (counseling low-income families to eat healthy foods, which can be very expensive).\nAll  these  factors  create  a  vicious  cycle  that  leads  to low  oral  health  care  support  in  children  with  early childhood caries (ECC). Many parents complain that the dental team did not offer a plan for continued care after GA (Anderson et al. 2004, Olley et al. 2011), and even those  who  brought  their  children  regularly  reported that  preventive  advice  and  interventions  were  poor (Peerbhay 2009, Olley et al. 2011, Karki et al. 2011). To further complicate matters, dentists seem to prefer operative  appointments  for  uncooperative  children  with\nECC, rather than focusing on prevention (Savanheimo and Vehkalahti 2008). However, children with ECC do not seem to respond to conventional or increased preventive care, which is dependent on regular attendance to the dental office (Almeida et al. 2000, Jamjoom et al. 2001, Amin et al. 2010). Intensive preventive care produced no decrease in new carious lesions in high risk patients compared to a basic prevention program, which involved less effort and lower costs (Hausen et al. 2000). Dental retreatment was prevalent even for children who complied with follow-up evaluations, despite a statistically  significant  improvement  in  plaque,  gingival  and mutans streptococci scores (Primosch et al. 2001).\nAggressive dental surgery for ECC may not result in acceptable clinical outcomes-that is, prevention of new carious  lesions.  It  is  possible  that  these  patients  are affected  by  more  virulent  strains  of  caries-producing bacteria. Recurrent caries are usually evident within a few  months  of  the  procedure,  with  many  patients returning for further treatment under GA (Foster et al. 2006, Jamieson and Vargas 2007, Olley et al. 2011). Some studies  were  able  to  identify  predictors  for  a  child's repeat visit to the OR (Sheller et al. 2003, Kakaounaki et al. 2011), but others failed to discriminate influences on predicting compliant behavior (Primosch et al. 2001).\nInnovative, family-centered, evidence-based interventions that address the social determinants of dental caries are needed to prevent dental disease (Amin and Harrison 2007, Olley et al. 2011). Dietary and preventive advice  should  be  provided  to  the  extended  family because it is not realistic to expect a change in the diet of one child alone. Furthermore, low income children, who comprise the largest share of the population affected by ECC,  face  many  barriers  regarding  food  insecurity, housing instability and access to dental care (da Fonseca 2012). Moreover, all these issues lead to maternal depression,  which  is  associated  with  decreased  positive  parenting  behaviors,  including  dental  care  (Kavanaugh et al. 2006). Oral health programs should be ongoingthey should not only be a snapshot in time. Counseling should  be  tailored  to  an  individual  parent's  stage  of change and readiness (Amin and Harrison 2007)."

The use of GA to provide dental care has dramatically increased in the past thirty years  due  to  increased  access  to  anesthesia  services, child behavioral concerns and parent preferences. Delivering  care  safely  under  GA  requires  firm  adherence to protocol and an appreciation for the strengths\nand  limitations  of  individual  surgical  venues.  While relatively  atraumatic,  a  significant  portion  of  children who undergo surgery have preoperative fear and anxiety. By considering child-specific conditions and interventions such as parental presence, pre-surgery preparation,  and  premedication,  it  may  be  possible  to limit adverse psychological effects of the surgical experience. While GA allows the dental team to address oral health  needs,  it  does  not  change  the  behaviors  that caused the conditions. Relapse following GA is common; thus,  clinicians  should  work  together  with  families  to improve post-operative outcomes."

    "context_enriched_content": "introduction\nMedical emergencies, sometimes life-threatening, can and do occur in the pediatric dental office. While one generally thinks of these as affecting the patient, many medical  emergencies  occur  to  others  in  the  dental office such as parents or caregivers, the pediatric dentist,  and  dental  staff.  Additionally,  many  pediatric dentists treat patients with special needs who tend to be relatively older, with more 'adult' types of medical emergencies. However, the focus of this chapter will be management of medical emergencies directly associated with pediatric sedation. For all other emergency situations, the reader is referred to textbooks devoted entirely  to  this  subject  (Bennet  and  Rosenberg  2002; Malamed 2007).\nIn-office  sedation  to  treat  children  has  increased over the past fifteen years. It is estimated that up to 20%  of  children  will  require  pharmacosedation  to safely and efficiently complete dental treatment. Children present the highest risk and lowest error tolerance in patient safety during sedation procedures. Although  rare,  the  most  serious  adverse  outcomes of  pediatric  sedation  are  brain  damage  and  death. Precipitating adverse events to these tragic outcomes are primarily respiratory, owing to the child's respiratory and cardiopulmonary physiology and anatomy (Chika 2012).  Prevention  of  an  emergency  is  much  more desirable  than  managing  one  once  it  occurs.  Most sedation  medical  emergencies  are  avoidable.  Strict adherence to sedation guidelines does not guarantee that emergencies will not occur, but it will definitely prevent most of them. A recent study of malpractice incidents  shows  that  guidelines  were  not  followed in the majority of cases (Chika 2012). Potential problems  also  may  occur  due  to  poor  patient  screening before treatment, overdoses of sedation or local anesthesia  agents,  improper  monitoring,  and  failure to  react  properly  once  an  emergency  situation  has been detected.\nThe basic algorithm for the management of most medical emergencies is: (P) position, (A) airway, (B) breathing, (C) circulation, and  (D)  definitive care: differential diagnosis,  drugs,  defibrillation.  The  algorithm  will  be discussed  in  detail  as  it  relates  to  pediatric  dental sedation."

    "context_enriched_content": "Medical history\nFamiliarity with the patient's medical history is highly important in preventing medical emergencies. Knowing what to expect of the patient based on her medical history is invaluable. Completion of the medical history questionnaire before the start of any dental treatment is  mandatory.  The  questionnaire  may  be  completed by  the  patient's  parent  or  legal  guardian  (Malamed 2010).  In  recent  years,  computerized  medical  history forms have become available, simplifying the historytaking process.\nNext,  the  pediatric  dentist  reviews  the  completed form with the patient's parent and questions any medical  problems  that  have  been  reported.  Through  this dialogue,  the  dentist  seeks  to  determine  any  reported medical  disorder's  significance  to  the  proposed  sedation.  For  example,  if  a  patient  has  had  an  asthmatic attack,  the  review  of  the  medical  history  will  include the  following  questions:  'How  often  does  the  patient experience attacks?' 'Are there any specific triggers?' 'When was the last attack?' 'Did it require a visit to the emergency  room  or  hospitalization?'  'Has  the  child ever required intubation in the hospital to manage the asthmatic attack?' 'What medications is the patient taking?'  'Does  the  child  carry  albuterol  with  them  on  a\nregular basis?' Obtaining  medical  histories for all patients has been   discussed in Chapter Six; however, it is  of  utmost  importance when scheduling a patient to receive sedation."

    "context_enriched_content": "Physical Examination\nThe  next  step  is  a  physical  exam.  Pediatric  dentists actually  perform  a  physical  exam  on  each  patient, whether they realize it or not. It may not be as comprehensive or time-consuming, nor is it done in exactly the same  fashion  as  those  conducted  by  physicians,  but nevertheless, one is done. The physical exam that pediatric dentists perform is partially formal and partially informal.  The  informal  part  consists  of  things  like  a simple  visual  inspection  of  the  patient.  By  simple observation,  the  pediatric  dentist  can  determine  if  a patient has various gross diseases such as obesity, jaundice,  exophthalmos,  breathing  difficulties  (asthma  or other  bronchospastic  diseases),  or  heart  defects;  possibly even conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be determined. These two items, history and physical examinations, are referred to as the H&P.\nThe more formal portion of the physical exam consists of such things as recording blood pressure, pulse rate, respirations,  height,  weight,  body  mass  index  (BMI), Mallampati classification and  American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Score."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  and  the  American Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP)  recommend  the  use  of BMI to  screen  for  overweight  and  obesity  in  children beginning at age two.\nBMI for age percentile results are divided into four main  groups:  children  under  the  5th  percentile  are considered  underweight;  those  between  the  5th  to 85th    percentile,  healthy  weight;  those  between  the 85th  to  95th  percentile  are  overweight;  and  those above the 95th percentile are obese, by definition. A recent  study  examined  childhood  overweight/obesity as a risk factor for adverse events during sedation for  dental  procedures  (Kang  et  al.  2012).  Overall, weight percentiles were higher in children who had one or more adverse events. Similarly, patients with higher BMI percentiles were more likely to experience adverse events. Although preliminary in nature, these findings  suggest  that  childhood  overweight/obesity may be associated with adverse events during sedation for dental procedures. Obese  child patients in  need  of  sedation  may  be  referred  to  a  medical center  or  may  be  treated  together  with  a  dentist anesthesiologist."

On average, for every one-point increase in the Mallampati score,  the  odds  of  having  obstructive  sleep  apnea increase  more  than  two-fold  (Nuckton  et  al.  2006). Patients  with  obstructive  sleep  apnea  are  generally not  good  candidates  for  moderate  sedation  administered by the pediatric dentist, as the perioperative risk to patients increases in proportion to the severity of sleep\nFigure  15-1. Mallampati  classification,  as  modified  by  Samsoon  and Young. Class I: uvula, faucial pillars, and soft palate are visible. Class II: faucial pillars and soft palate are visible. Class III: soft palate is visible. Class IV: hard palate only is visible.  Baker,  S.  and Yagiela,  J.A.  (2006). Pediatric  Dentistry, 28,487-493. Reproduced with permission from AAPD.\napnea.  The  pediatric  dentist  should  consider  working with  a  dentist  anesthesiologist  to  treat  these  patients (see Chapter Thirteen).\nBy age eight or so, most children have an airway that resembles that of an adult more than that of an infant or small child. Prior to this point, there are significant anatomical differences compared to adults. Infants have a larynx at C3-4-not C4-5, as in adults-that pushes the tongue, that is larger, superiorly. The epiglottis is also larger, stiffer, and angled posteriorly. Pediatric patients have  a  large  thyroid  cartilage  and  a  narrow  cricoid cartilage-the narrowest portion of the airway in pediatric patients. Infants may require shoulder or neck rolls in  the  event  that  they  require  facemask  ventilation. When evaluating infants, pay particular attention to the chin: if it is posterior to the upper lip, a difficult airway can be expected. Nasal and oral airways can be particularly useful in infants or pediatric patients.\nAfter completion and review of the H&P, the dentist assigns the patient to a physical status category. Most patients,  especially  pediatric  dental  patients,  are  quite healthy. By definition, these are 'ASA I' patients with low risk of complications."

    "context_enriched_content": "American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Score\nThe American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) proposed the physical status (ASA PS) classification of preoperative patients for anesthetic risk assessment in 1963. The ASA score  is  a  subjective  assessment  of  a  patient's  overall health  based  on  five  classes  (see  Table  10-3  in  Chapter Ten). Only patients with an ASA score of I (a completely healthy, fit patient) or II (a patient with mild systemic disease)  should  be  sedated  in  a  private  dental  setting. Wolters et al. (1996) examined the strength of association between ASA physical status classification and perioperative risk factors and postoperative outcome, concluding that ASA physical status classification was a predictor of postoperative outcome. To summarize, a patient's BMI, airway  evaluation  and  ASA  score  may  all  be  used  to screen out potentially complicated patients."

    "context_enriched_content": "Medical emergencies\nEarly recognition of medical emergencies begins at the first sign or symptom (Norris 1994). The pediatric dentist  needs  to  focus  on  what  is  happening  second-bysecond during a medical emergency. Distractions slow response time, and pediatric patients have physiological and  anatomical  differences  from  adults.  This  causes pediatric  medical  emergencies  to  proceed  much  more rapidly than with adults. When treatment is indicated, the  dentist  should  immediately proceed. Management of  medical  emergencies  in  the  dental  office  may  be limited  to  supporting  a  patient's  vital  functions  until emergency medical services (EMS) arrive, especially in the  case  of  major  morbidity.  It  may  also  involve  real, aggressive action to address a particular situation such as  anaphylaxis.  Treatment  should  always  minimally consist of basic life support and monitoring of vital signs (Fukayama and Yagiela 2006).\nThe  dentist  should  never  administer  poorly  understood medications. The drugs discussed in this chapter will be limited to those that a pediatric dentist is trained to use and administer. Since there is no venous access during  minimal  and  moderate  sedation,  drugs  given intravenously will be avoided."

It causes bronchodilation that increases the lumen size of the bronchioles, leading to better oxygen uptake. Dose: Two puffs with deep inspiration. [source: drug package insert]\n- Epinephrine is the universal agonist; it affects alpha one, alpha two, beta one and beta two receptors. This is the only drug in the medical emergency kit that must be given rapidly in order to save a patient's life. In case of anaphylaxis, the severe life-threatening allergic reaction, this is the only drug that will help. Alpha one agonistic activity increases blood pressure by causing a vasoconstriction. Beta one effects of epinephrine increase heart rate, force of contraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Epinephrine's beta two effects cause bronchodilation, making breathing easier. It may also be used for severe asthmatic attacks unresponsive to albuterol.\n- Dose: Pediatric 0.01 mg/kg IM maximum 0.3 mg/dose. Adult: 0.3 mg/dose [source: drug package insert]\n- Diphenhydramine is used for mild allergic  reactions.  Histamine  blockers  reverse  the  actions  of  histamine  by  occupying H1 receptor sites on the effector cell, and are effective in patients with mild or delayed-onset allergic reactions. Dose: 1-2 mg/kg IM up to 50 mg. [source: drug package insert]\n- Naloxone is required in the medical emergency kit only if sedation using an opioid is used in the pediatric dental office. Naloxone is the specific antagonist for any of the opioids. It may be administered IV or IM, and has a duration of action of roughly 45 minutes if administered IV, and four hours if administered IM. [source: package insert for Narcan]\n- Flumazenil. Most regulatory jurisdictions will require the immediate availability of flumazenil as a required component of the medical emergency kit if sedation using a benzodiazepine is used in the pediatric dental office. While this drug may be legally required, it must be strongly emphasized that the package insert for flumazenil, in no uncertain terms, explicitly says that this drug must be administered IV only. Therefore, if no one in the pediatric dental office is trained to start an IV and uses it regularly, the reality is that flumazenil will not be a valuable drug in a medical emergency. [source: package insert for Romazicon]\nis, one algorithm fits all cases, and all cases are worked through  in  the  same  organizational  method  each  and every time. This adds consistency and predictability to a response to a medical emergency.

Note  that  drug therapy is always secondary to basic life support. The basic  intent  in  responding  to  a  medical  emergency  is always the same: ensure that the patient's brain receives a  constant  supply  of  blood  containing  oxygen  and glucose with enough perfusion pressure to keep it functioning, and without morbidity."

    "context_enriched_content": "Recognize the Problem\nPrior  to  initiating  the  emergency  logarithm  protocol, the pediatric dentist needs to recognize that an emergency  situation  is  present.  Recognition  of  the sedated  pediatric  patient's  problem  comes  about  by continuous monitoring, as  per AAPD guidelines. The patient's pulse, oxygen saturation, and breathing should always be within age-appropriate normal ranges. Heart rates are typically higher in children and decrease with increasing age. For example, the normal ranges are 80-130 BPM in a two-year-old, and 70-110 BPM in a ten-year-old (Haas 2010). Any changes need to be immediately identified and   analyzed. The following can be regarded as warning signs:\n- Change in saturation level : If this occurs, reposition pulse oximeter probe (or, if the extremity is restrained, loosen strap), reposition head, and raise the chin. If level returns to normal, continue treatment.\n- The  unresponsive  sedated  patient :  For  the  most part,  pediatric  dentists  only  administer  minimal and  moderate  sedation.  Patients  undergoing  such sedations should be responsive.\nA  sedated  patient  who  fails  to  respond  may  have advanced to a state of deep sedation, which represents an  emergency  situation.  Therefore,  the  dentist  should cease treatment and evaluate the patient's state. To begin patient  evaluation,  try  to  elicit  a  response.  After  verifying unresponsiveness  by  stimulating  the  patient, including  head  tilt  and  jaw  lift  (Figure  15-3),  remove rubber dam.\nIf  using nitrous oxide sedation, immediately deliver 100%  oxygen.  Activate  the  office  emergency  team/ plan/protocol.  Emergency  medical  assistance  (EMS) should be sought once the dentist, who is legally responsible for the patient, feels it is needed.\nFollowing these steps, proceed immediately to (P)  position:  place  the  patient  supine  in  the  dental chair with legs elevated slightly (Figure 15-4).\nFigure 15-2. Dentists should initially manage all medical emergencies in the same way by using what is known as the basic algorithm. Based on Malamed, S.F . (2007).

Lepere (2002) demonstrated that the modern dental chair provides firm support for the spinal cord, enabling sufficient blood volume to circulate  during  cardiac  arrest.  Most  dental  chairs  are programmable,  allowing  the  clinician  to  preset  an emergency position option. Pediatric treatment benches  are flat and  suitable for delivery of all emergency treatment;  a  pillow  may  be  placed  under the child's legs for their elevation. Almost all medical emergencies involving loss of consciousness share the same cause: low blood pressure in the brain. Unconsciousness is defined as the absence of response to sensory stimulation (e.g., verbal or physical stimulation).  Making  the  patient  supine  will  increase  blood pressure in the brain and allow the patient to regain consciousness  in  most  cases.  If  the  patient  remains unresponsive, proceed to ABC."

By  itself,  this  maneuver  may  prevent  brain damage, as it moves the tongue away from the back of the  pharynx,  thereby  eliminating  the  obstruction  (the tongue). In turn, this permits oxygenation. If the airway is  not  patent  after  this  maneuver,  the  clinician  should reposition the patient's head once more.

    "context_enriched_content": "Respiratory Obstruction\nBy  far,  the  most  common  type  of  medical  emergency from an oral sedation overdose is respiratory obstruction. In this case, it is the obligation of the pediatric dentist to stop the dental procedure and 'rescue' the patient. While it is possible that a patient may be sensitive to a drug, the dentists administering more than the recommended dose of a sedation agent causes the overwhelming majority of oral sedation overdoses in pediatric dental offices. Benzodiazepines  are  most  likely  to  cause  respiratory obstruction. They are the most widely used class of drugs for oral sedation in the pediatric dental office today, and when used in recommended doses, they are remarkably safe.  Some  pediatric  dentists,  however,  are  tempted  to push the limits of oral sedation in their practices. While it is  true  that  increasing  the  dose  of  a  sedative  agent increases efficacy, it is equally true that increasing doses beyond  a  manufacturer's  recommendations  leads  to decreased safety. The dose in a package insert has been shown to be both safe and efficacious. Beyond that dose, there is no safety data.\nThe tongue relaxing and obstructing the airway typically causes respiratory obstruction. The treatment is to pull the tongue off of the airway, which has classically been treated as simply a head tilt with a chin lift. More recently, a jaw thrust with less head tilt and chin lift has been demonstrated to be even more effective.\nFinally,  turning  the  patient's  head  approximately 30  degrees  to  either  side  opens  the  airway  even  more efficiently.  Assuming  the  oral  sedation  drug  was  not given in such a large dose as to cause the respiratory obstruction,  the  patient  should  regain  consciousness with spontaneous ventilation within 1-3 minutes.\nFlumazenil,  which  is  in  the  medical  emergency  kit, reverses the effect of the benzodiazepines. However, the\ndrug package insert clearly states that this drug must be given IV only. Flumazenil should never be administered IM, subcutaneously, or sublingually. Flumazenil, therefore, is of little benefit to most pediatric dentists who do not use IV regularly, and it should not be relied upon for a benzodiazepine overdose."

    "context_enriched_content": "Respiratory Depression\nThe second type of respiratory event secondary to an overdose of an orally administered sedative is respiratory depression. It rarely occurs after administration of a benzodiazepine alone. When respiratory depression occurs, it is almost always associated  with  the  administration  of  an  opioid,  which  is essentially always administered in conjunction with a benzodiazepine (never  by  itself).  Opioids  benefit  oral sedation, but they do so at additional risk. Opioids do not have the wide safety profile of the benzodiazepines, and their overdose is not managed as simply as head tilt with  chin  lift.  Again,  not  exceeding  a  manufacturer's maximum  recommended  doses  means  overdose  will rarely  occur.  However,  pushing  the  limits  by  adding 'just a little bit more' every time will eventually cause overdose. Respiratory depression always follows or is in conjunction with respiratory obstruction, so head tilt with chin lift and/or jaw thrust still needs to be done. In addition  to  good  airway  management,  respiratory depression  requires  the  delivery  of  positive  pressure oxygen via a bag-valve-mask technique to either supplement or supplant respiratory effort by the patient. The mask is sealed with the thumbs of each hand and the  mandible  is  elevated  via  jaw  thrust  to  open  the airway.  One  person  performs  the  ventilations  while another  maintains  a  patent  airway  with  two  hands (Figure 15-5).\nUnlike  flumazenil,  the  specific  opioid  antagonist naloxone may  be administered IM. However, IM administration has a significantly longer onset and peak effect than IV administration. Expect 2-3 minutes for an onset of action of IM naloxone and a peak effect to be achieved 10-15 minutes after IM administration."

In children younger than the age of adolescence-defined as the age just before the onset of puberty, as determined by the presence of secondary sex characteristics-the clinician should administer rescue breaths at a rate of 12-20 breaths per minute.(For  teenagers  and  adults,  the  rate  should  be 10-12 breaths per minute.) Next, the carotid pulse is palpated.  In  an  unconscious  child,  adolescent,  or  adult patient,  the  carotid  is  the  best  artery  for  assessing  the pulse.  To  locate  the  carotid  pulse,  the  dentist  or  team member  palpates  the  patient's  thyroid  cartilage,  then moves the fingers into the 'groove' just before encountering the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure 15-6).\nAlthough BLS training for laypeople recommends skipping the pulse check, that rule does not apply to health care providers, including dentists. Health care professionals are expected  to  be  able  to  detect  a  pulse  (Haas  2010).  If  no\npulse can be palpated after 10 seconds, the dentist or a staff member should assume that the patient has experienced cardiac arrest and begin chest compressions at a rate of 100 per minute, consistent with current BLS training.\nThe dentist should place hands over the lower half of the patient's sternum between the nipples, then, push down by using the heel of one hand with the other hand on top.  For  children  older  than  one  year  but  younger than  the  age  of  adolescence,  the  compressions  should depress the chest by one-third to one-half its depth. For older  children  and  adults,  each  compression  should depress the chest 1.5-2 inches. It is important that the clinician push hard and fast and allow full chest recoil. The  compression-to-ventilation  ratio  for  one-person CPR in children is the same as that in adults (30:2), but for  two-person  CPR  in  children,  the  ratio  should  be 15:2.  Four  to  five  sequences  are  provided  in  approximately 2 minutes. Coincident with beginning BLS is the administration of oxygen. The next step is to turn on the AED and follow the voice prompts.\nAs  mentioned,  the  goal  of  the  steps  (P → A → B → C) described thus far is to ensure that the victim's brain and heart are receiving an adequate supply of blood containing oxygen and sugar, the fuels required by the cells of the body to maintain normal function."

The  easiest  and  least-invasive way to increase blood flow to the brain is to place the patient in a supine position. Patients in whom dizziness is  the  only  symptom  are  conscious  and  able  to  talk (airway, breathing, and circulation have been assessed and  verified).  Definitive  therapy  consists  simply  of placing the patient properly in a supine position. The Trendelenburg  position  is  less  ideal.  In  that  position, the contents of the lower gastrointestinal tract impinge on the diaphragm, increasing the breathing effort. Once the patient is   positioned properly, the pediatric dentist should determine the cause of the dizziness. What was the  cause?  Was  it  initiated  by  vasovagal  syncope? Hypoglycemia?

However, a lower peak also occurs in older infants and toddlers (Wieling et al. 2004). By far the most common cause of syncope in young subjects is  a  reflex  syncopal  event,  and  in  particular  a  vasovagal faint.\nThe basic algorithm is the same as that for dizziness, described earlier. The dentist or a team member should place  the  patient  in  a  supine  position.  Most  patients with syncope have a patent airway, are breathing, and demonstrate  an  adequate  pulse.  Patients  who  faint typically  respond  to  positional  changes  within  30-60 seconds.  If  the  patient  does  not  respond  in  this  time frame,  he  did  not  simply  faint,  and  the  dentist  must consider a differential diagnosis. The responding patient should be kept in a supine position and administered  100%  oxygen  until  full  recovery.

Sometimes, but not always,  these  patients  have  a  history  of  diabetes. Pediatric  dental  patients  with  type  1  diabetes  (and some with type 2) self-administer insulin  to  lower  a high glucose level (hyperglycemia) toward the upper limit of normal (120 milligrams/deciliter or 6 mmol/L). Patients with diabetes must ingest food immediately after administering insulin to prevent the development of  hypoglycemia  as  a  result  of  the  insulin  injection. The most common cause of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes is not eating after administering insulin.\nPatients with clinically significant hypoglycemia may be recognizable because they commonly experience diaphoresis  and  tachycardia,  causing  them  to  feel  faint. Subsequently, they may be confused and ultimately lose consciousness. As long as the patient retains consciousness, the clinician should allow her to remain in a comfortable position. Conscious patients with hypoglycemia have a patent airway, are breathing, and have an adequate pulse. The treatment of choice for patients with hypoglycemia  is  administration  of  sugar  (specifically glucose,  not  sucrose).  Unconscious  pediatric  dental patients with hypoglycemia require parenteral administration of sugar. Absolutely never place anything into  the  mouth  of  an  unconscious  patient.  Absent proficiency in venipuncture for the pediatric patient, the dentist should activate EMS.\nIn  each  of  these  examples  of  unconsciousness,  the initial  management  of  the  emergency  situation  is  the same. The dentist should place the patient in a supine position.  If  the  child  has  not  responded  within  one minute,  the  clinician  probably  can  rule  out  syncope. The  dentist  then  should  open  the  airway  and  assess breathing  ('look,  listen,  and  feel')  (American  Heart Association 2005). If the patient is breathing, the next step is to check circulation. Does the patient have a palpable pulse at the carotid artery (or brachial artery, in infants)?  Patients  who  are  breathing  spontaneously and normally may be experiencing hypoglycemia or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but not cardiac arrest. In cardiac arrest, the patient does not breathe spontaneously  (agonal  breathing  notwithstanding).  A  patient with apnea requires positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen.\nPatients  placed  in  a  supine  position  who  do  not respond within 30-60 seconds but are breathing spontaneously are likely experiencing hypoglycemia or a CVA. If the patient's blood pressure is normal (that is, close to baseline  values)  the  problem  is  probably  a  low  blood glucose level."

The patient experiencing a  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure  (the  term  currently preferred over Grand Mal) is unconscious and should be placed in a supine position. The dentist should perform a  'head  tilt,  chin  lift,  and  jaw  thrust'  to  the  farthest extent possible. Patients who are seizing are breathing and have adequate cardiovascular function, which the pediatric dentist can verify by checking for and finding a strong carotid pulse.\nThe pediatric dentist or a team member must remove all dental instruments and supplies from the patient's mouth  and  protect  him  from  harm.  No  one  should place anything into the mouth of a patient who is seizing.  The  pediatric  dentist  or  a  team  member  should bring  the  patient's  parent  into  the  operatory  to  help evaluate  the  patient.

Penicillin is the most common  cause  of drug-induced anaphylaxis (Lieberman  et  al.  2005).  Patients  can  have  allergies  to penicillin and penicillin-like drugs (amoxicillin, Augmentin®, etc.),  as  well  as  other  drugs  and  agents prescribed, administered, and dispensed in dental offices. It should be noted here that a true allergic reaction  to  an  injected  local  anesthetic  in  dentistry  has  an incidence approaching zero. It simply does not occur to any measurable degree (Malamed 2007).\nIf the allergic reaction presents with itching, hives, or a rash as the only signs and symptoms, the allergy may be considered mild (non-life-threatening). However, if the patient  experiences  cardiovascular  and/or  respiratory embarrassment, which are normally seen as dizziness or loss of consciousness due to inadequate blood pressure and/or blood flow to the brain (cardiovascular issues), or difficulty  in  breathing  (respiratory  issues),  the  dental professional must treat the allergy as a life-threatening situation (Reed 2010).\nIn addition to severity, allergic reactions may also be characterized  based  on  time.  Those  allergic  reactions occurring many minutes to many hours after exposure to the allergen may be termed 'delayed onset,' while those that occur within a few seconds to a few minutes after contact with the allergen are termed 'immediate onset.' As a general rule, the faster the signs and/or symptoms occur, the more likely a severe allergy will occur. It is not the purpose of this chapter to review the intricate  pathophysiology  of  allergy  involving  IgE, IgG,  and  other  antigen-antibody  and  other  cellular responses, or deal with non-life-threatening mild allergies."

    "context_enriched_content": "Severe Allergy (Anaphylaxis)\nAnaphylaxis  is  an  acute,  life-threatening,  systemic reaction with varied mechanisms and clinical presentations. Immediate  discontinuation  of  the offending drug(s) and early administration of epinephrine are the cornerstones of treatment. Epinephrine is the drug of choice  in  the  treatment  of  anaphylaxis  because  its alpha-1 effects help support the blood pressure, while its  beta-2  effects  provide  bronchial  smooth-muscle relaxation  (Hepner  and  Castells  2003).  Absorption  is faster  and  plasma  levels  are  higher  in  patients  who receive epinephrine intramuscularly in the thigh with an  autoinjector  (Simons  et  al.  1998).  Intramuscular injection into the thigh (vastus lateralis) is also superior to  intramuscular  or  subcutaneous  injection  into  the arm (deltoid) (Simons et al. 2001). No established dosage or regimen for intravenous epinephrine in anaphylaxis is recognized. Because of the risk for potentially lethal  arrhythmias,  epinephrine  should  be  administered  intravenously  only  during  cardiac  arrest,  or  to profoundly  hypotensive  subjects  who  have  failed  to respond to intravenous volume replacement and several injected doses of epinephrine (Malamed 2007).\nIf the allergy is severe, the patient has lost (or will soon  lose)  consciousness.  The  dentist  should  place the patient in a supine position, open the airway, and evaluate breathing. Often, breathing is spontaneous and adequate. If the patient is not breathing, the dental professional  must  administer  positive pressure oxygen via a bag-valve-mask device. If the patient  has  lost  consciousness,  their  cerebral  blood pressure is too low. Another dental staff member also must  contact  EMS,  as  the  patient  likely  requires treatment in hospital. The appropriate pharmacologic management for anaphylaxis in an outpatient setting is outlined in Figure 15-7.\nPrecaution : When treating dental office patients who may have a history of allergic reactions, the first step is to consult with an allergist to test the patient for allergy to  the  drug  in  question.  Treatment  should  be  postponed, if at all possible, until this is accomplished. If the allergy is truly to a local anesthetic, another option is  the  use of general anesthesia, Yet another option is the  use  of  a  histamine  blocker  such  as  diphenhydramine as a local anesthetic for pain management during treatment. Most injectable histamine blockers possess\nFigure 15-7. Pharmacologic management of anaphylaxis.\nlocal anesthetic properties. Diphenhydramine has been the  most  commonly  used  histamine-blocker  in  this regard (Reed 2010)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Foreign Body Aspiration\nA  common  hazard  in  dental  practice  that  cannot  be taken  lightly  is  aspiration  of  dental  instruments  and materials  (Cameron  et  al.  1996).  Aspiration  of  foreign objects during restorative procedures, especially under sedation,  remains  a  real  threat  due  to  the  challenges involved  with  treating  young  children  and  the  difficulties  of  airway  management  (Adewumi  and  Kays 2008). Such incidents reinforce the need for prevention. The  practicing  dentist  should  routinely  employ  adequate  barrier  techniques  and  high  volume  suction. Rubber dams should be used routinely and cotton rolls should never be left in a sedated child's mouth. During handling  of  stainless  steel  crowns,  extra  precaution  is needed  if  the  rubber  dam  is  removed.  A  gauze  pad should be used as a throat partition, and the assistant should be prepared with the high volume suction for instant retrieval of a lost crown.\nFollowing  aspiration,  most  foreign  bodies  become lodged in the peripheral airways. Large, sharp, or irregular objects may lodge at the laryngeal inlet, especially in  children  less  than  one  year  old  (Leith  et  al.  2008). Foreign  bodies  may  also  lodge  in  the  trachea,  but  in most cases the inhaled object passes down into one of the  main  bronchi.  In  adults,  the  right  bronchus  is  the most common site for a foreign body to lodge because of its wider diameter and more vertical disposition (Zerella et al. 1998). However, in children, the impaction site of a foreign body is determined by the individual anatomy of the airway, and studies have shown that there is little difference in the distribution of inhaled foreign bodies between the right and left main bronchi in this age group (Zerella et al. 1998, Black et al. 1994, Ciftci et al. 2003). This is generally explained by the relatively symmetric bronchial angles in the pediatric airway until about fifteen years of age.\nThe American Heart Association (2005) has published guidelines  for  the  acute  management  of  foreign  body airway  obstruction.  If  the  obstruction  is  mild  and  the child  can  cough  and  make  some  sounds,  it  is  recommended not to interfere and to allow the victim to clear the airway by coughing or gagging, while observing for more severe signs. These airway reflexes are protective, and indicate that the obstruction is incomplete. Complete airway obstruction is recognized by sudden respiratory distress.  If  the  obstruction  is  complete  and  the  child cannot make sounds, subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts  (the  Heimlich  maneuver)  are  indicated  for  the child who is one year of age or older. This may be accomplished  by  lifting  the  child  and  delivering  the  thrusts from behind while standing, or the abdominal thrust may be modified for the patient in the dental chair by delivering the thrust with the heel of the hand from the front of the  child  (Ganzberg  2013).  If  the  victim  becomes  unresponsive, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be initiated. It is important to attempt to remove an object from the  pharynx  with  caution,  as  blind  finger  sweeps  can push obstructing objects further into the oropharynx."

    "context_enriched_content": "Brian D. Lee\nThe foundation for practicing pediatric dentistry is the ability to guide infants, children, and adolescents through  their dental experiences. Today,  practicing pediatric dentistry is a team effort, with dentists leading and delegating responsibilities to team members: trained dental auxiliaries and administrative office staff. A pediatric dental team has to work together so that the patient develops a positive attitude toward the dental experience.\nThe pediatric dental team is an extension of the dentist  in  that  it  uses  communicative  behavior  guidance techniques, leading the child patient stepwise through the  dental  experience.  All  personnel  have  a  stake  in guiding the child through the experience. Dental auxiliaries  and  reception  staff  are  invaluable  when  dealing with the pediatric patient (Wright 1983). Therefore, all dental  team  members are encouraged to expand their skills  and  knowledge  in  behavior  management  techniques.  When  assembling  a  team,  technical  skills  are important, but the authors have found that it is more important to hire for positive attitude and passion first. Happy individuals are much more likely to participate in  activities  that  are  adaptive,  both  for  them  and  the people around them (Fredrickson 2004)."

Have a positive, upbeat approach. Positive attitudes lead to positive outcomes.\n2. Have  a  team  attitude and  culture. Personality factors, shared values, and commitments to action serve as the basis for relationships and behaviors.\n3. Have organized plans and protocols. Written protocols  and  contingency  plans  with  defined  roles  for each  team  member  are  characteristics  of  a  wellorganized office. With increased effectiveness and  efficiency,  there  are  fewer  delays  and  less indecisiveness.\n4. Be truthful and credible. These traits help to build trust with your team members and your patients.\n5. Be tolerant and empathic. Cope and with different behaviors and situations while maintaining composure and self-control.\n6. Be flexible. Team  members  have to adapt to each  situation because  children's  behaviors  are unpredictable.\nWhile  nearly  everyone  would  agree  with  these  rules, following them is another matter. They are often overlooked. To illuminate the points, Wright applied these rules in context with  case scenarios (1983).  These updated cases remain applicable today."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.1 The Positive Approach\nFour-year-old Johnny sat in the reception area, awaiting his third dental checkup appointment. Entering the area, the  receptionist  greeted  him: 'Hi  Johnny,  it's  your  turn now.'  Johnny  withdrew  slightly  and  held  his  parent's hand  firmly.  Noticing  this,  the  dental  assistant  said, 'Johnny, don't be afraid. Nothing will hurt you.'\nCase 16.1, Discussion: Both  the  receptionist  and  the dental assistant greeted Johnny, and the dental assistant tried to relax him to encourage a smooth patient transfer\nfrom  the  reception  area  to  the  dental  clinic.  Without realizing it,  however, the dental assistant's final comment  violated  a  fundamental  precept  of  pediatric patient management: the entire dental team's approach must be positive.\nA more positive effect could have been created if the receptionist  had  simply  said  something  concrete  and truthful, such as 'Hi Johnny, I like your outfit, it is so colorful and bright. I am glad you came today. We are excited to see you.' Then the dental assistant could have taken  the  lead  and  said  'Come  on  Johnny.  You  were such a good boy last time when you were able to help count your teeth. Dr. J. really wants to see if you can still count to twenty. Let's go quickly.'\nTo achieve success with children, it is important to anticipate  success  (Wright  1975).  Positive  statements are  far  more  effective  than  thoughtless  questions  or remarks  directed  mostly  to  parent  figures.  When dealing  with  difficult  pediatric  patients,  the  dental team  has  to  mask  emotional  reactions  and  remain positive. The dental team  member's  attitudes or expectation can affect the outcome of an appointment because children are likely to respond with the type of behavior expected of them. In essence, the child fulfills the dentist's prophecy. This theory was advanced by Rosenthal and Jacobson in their book Pygmalion in the Classroom ,  which discusses children and the educational process.\nIn addition to taking a positive approach, the dental team has to be direct, specific, and confident. Questions that imply choice should be avoided unless the choice will  definitely  be  granted.  For  example,  the  dental assistant  summoning  a  child  from  the  reception  area will  undoubtedly  get  a  better  response  by  saying 'Johnny it's  your  turn  to  see  Dr.  J.,  please  come  with me,' rather than asking, 'Johnny, would you come with me?' The same is true when the dental team member says, 'Now I am going to brush and clean your teeth. Please help me by opening nice and big,' rather than 'I  think it is time to clean your teeth now, OK?' Positive and direct communication is easy to learn, and after a short period of time it becomes automatic. All members of  the  dental  team  should  be  aware  of  its  importance and help one another to use it with children. Another approach is indeed to give the child a choice, but structure  the  question  and  possible  choices  so  that  both options will be acceptable and lead to the same outcome. For example, do not ask 'Would you like me to clean your teeth?' Instead, ask 'Would you like me to clean your top teeth first, or start with your lower ones?' The child is given a choice. Both options will lead to the start of  the  cleaning.  There  is  actually  a  benefit  to  this approach:  the  child  subconsciously  realizes  that  he made the choice to start the cleaning."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.2 Team Attitude and Culture\nMrs. W. brought her six-year-old to the dental office for a recall appointment. As they approached the front desk, the  receptionist  greeted  them:  'Hello,  Mrs.  W.  and William. Please fill out a medical update, give me your insurance card so I can copy it, and then have a seat. The doctor will be with you in a few moments.'\nCase  16.2,  Discussion :  The  proper  team  attitude  for dealing with children includes personality factors, such as warmth or patient interest that can be conveyed without a spoken  word.  A  pleasant  smile  is  body  language  that engages multisensory communication, and it may indicate to a child that the adult cares. In this case, the greeting to the child and his mother was businesslike, matter of fact, and  formal.  While  this  may  be  suitable  for  some  adult patients,  a  nicer  welcoming  for  the  child  might  be,  'Hi Billy, good to see you. How is school these days?' Children are informal. Consequently, they respond best to an attitude that is natural and friendly. Acknowledging Billy's presence  first  also  makes  him  the  center  of  attention.  It places  the  child  at  the  apex  of  the  Pediatric  Dentistry Treatment Triangle. At that point, the receptionist can hand out the medical update, which includes a section on insurance, and ask the parent if she needs help filling it out.\nAn attitude of friendliness can be   conveyed to the child patient almost immediately. A casual greeting, such as, 'Hi buddy, how are you today?' usually evokes a smile, whereas 'Hello William' does not tend to put a child at ease. A mechanical tone   certainly should be avoided, and modulation of voice control should be encouraged. As they famously say in Hawaii, 'Hang loose.'\nChildren can be made to feel at home in the dental office in many ways. If youngsters have nicknames they prefer, these should be noted on their patient records and used during  future  appointments  to  promote  a  natural  and friendly atmosphere. For example, if William prefers to be called 'Billy,' it should be noted and used at all times.\nThe world that we live in today is one that embraces multi-culturalism and diversity. Just look at the authors and contributors in this book. 'It is a Small World After All'  (Thomas Friedman). Today it is very common to welcome children in our practices with unique names. For those names that are unfamiliar and difficult to pronounce,  it  often  helps  to  have  the  phonetic  spelling noted in their charts.\nAdditionally,  patients'  school  accomplishments  or extracurricular activities should be noted in the dental record. Most children are delighted to share their interests and hobbies. Keeping this in mind, and keeping a\nrecord of those interests, helps the team initiate future conversations and demonstrate a caring attitude toward child patients. However, care must be taken to prevent matters  from  getting  out  of  hand.  For  example,  after telling  the  dental  team  stories,  a  child  may  become excited  and  difficult  to  settle  down  for  the  dental procedure. While friendliness is fundamental to behavior management, over-permissiveness or an overly affectionate approach should be avoided. Thus, the dental team must project a degree of firm confidence when  necessary.  Children  have  to  respect  the  team approach and realize who the leader is. They must be aware  of  what  is  expected  of  them.  Sometimes  the behavior  guidelines  can  be  re-established  by  simply saying,  'Billy,  there  is  a  time  for  play  and  a  time  for work. Now it is time to work.' The whole team must embody this attitude and culture."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.3 Organized Plans and Protocols\nFive-year-old Tammy had two restorative dental appointments during the previous month and, although not easy to  manage,  she  cooperated  adequately  to  allow  the treatment. Now Tammy requires anterior restorations. At the  outset,  the  dentist  invited Tammy's  parent  into  the dental  operatory  to  explain  the  anterior  restorations. While Tammy was seated in the dental chair, the dentist explained the proposed treatment. Since the parent had several questions, the discussion dragged on for fifteen minutes. Eventually, Tammy became restless and began to complain, whine and whimper.\nCase  16.3,  Discussion :  This  case  illustrates  another funda  mental aspect of behavior management. In pediatric  dentistry,  an  organized  plan  or  protocol  is  a necessity. A proper, prioritized treatment plan should have  been  discussed  with  the  parent  prior  to  the appointment, ideally at the examination and treatment planning  appointment.  In  this case, detailing the procedure at the beginning of the appointment delayed the  start  of  the  treatment  and  was  unfair  to  both  the child  and  the  parent.  Technical  discussions  in  the presence of a child may build apprehension, and hurrying the conversation does not allow a parent sufficient time to ask questions and make an informed decision.\nOrganized plans and protocols in the dental office have many dimensions. For example, begin with the reception area.  Who  summons  the  new  patient-the  dentist,  the dental assistant, the dental hygienist, or the receptionist?\nIf a child creates a   disturbance in the   reception area, who deals with the situation? A plan might stipulate that the dentist be summoned at once, but this may differ from office to office. Each dental office must design its own contingency plans, and the entire office team must know in advance what is expected of them. Such plans can be placed in the office and employment manuals, and are a key feature of many pediatric dental offices. Good plans increase  efficiency  and  contribute  to  successful  work environments as well as positive relationships between dental teams and child patients."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.4 Truthfulness and Credibility\nAn  alert  dental  assistant  has  seated  a  three-year-old patient in the dental chair. While waiting for the dentist, the child looks up and asks, 'Am I going to get a shot today?' The dental assistant replies hesitantly, 'I'm not sure. Ask when the doctor comes in.'\nCase 16.4, Discussion : Many dental assistants have been placed in a position similar to this one. The child asks the  question  with  an  apparent  concern.  If  the  dental assistant  replies  affirmatively,  the  young  child  might become  very  apprehensive,  and  a  behavior  problem could ensue. If the dental assistant states that the child is not  going  to  have  an  injection  and,  in  fact,  the  child needs one, then credibility is lost. Therefore, the assistant adopted an appropriate, 'middle-of-the-road' course of action.  She  deferred  to  the  dentist  to  inform  the  child and intercept any adverse behavior if it occurs.\nUnlike  adults,  most  children  see  things  as  either 'black or white.' Examples must be concrete. There are no  'shades  of  grey.'  To  them,  shades  between  are abstract and difficult to understand. To youngsters, the dental team is either truthful or not. Therefore, truthfulness is extremely important in building trust, and is a fundamental rule for dealing with children.\nAs  the  above  case  exemplifies,  the  dental  team should  be  careful not to be trapped  into  being untruthful  by  circumstances.  For  example,  when  a child is told that an appointment is for a checkup, it is wrong  to  proceed  with  a  restoration  without  the child's permission. Since children often do not understand  the  reason  for  a  change  in  plan,  the  dentists must take the time to explain. Sometimes parents coax the  dentist  to  complete  the  work  at  the  checkup appointment. If this occurs, it seems reasonable to ask the child, 'Would you mind having a filling today so that you do not have to come back tomorrow? If I do it today, then Daddy won't have to take more time off\nwork.' If the child is agreeable, then the dentist may proceed.  If  the  reply  is  negative,  the  child  patient's choice should be respected because the youngster was told at the beginning that the appointment was for a 'checkup.' Parents will accept the explanation that it is wrong to establish one set of expectancies for their child  and  then  suddenly  revise  them.  Remember, parents  and  caregivers  are part of the Pediatric Dentistry Treatment Triangle, and most are interested in  their  children  having  good  working relationships with their dentists. They do not want to see confidence and trust destroyed."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.5 Tolerance and Empathy\nEight-year-old Paul was undergoing a one-hour restorative appointment.  Although  he  experienced  no  pain,  Paul whined and fidgeted throughout the appointment. Despite the dental team's best efforts, the child's behavior aggravated them. In an attempt to modify the situation, the  dentist  firmly  instructed  Paul  to  stop  whining  and moving. This proved unsuccessful; the disturbance continued and the child began to scream. Finally, the dentist felt that she was about to lose control. She decided to take a 'time out' and walk away from the dental chair.\nCase  16.5,  Discussion :  This  could  happen.  Children sometimes whine, fidget, and aggravate, despite the best dental team efforts to minimize disruptive behavior. The  important  point  is  that  the  dentist  recognized  a potential  loss  of  personal  control.  This  story  demonstrates that all people have limitations in dealing with negative  behaviors.  Recognizing  individual  tolerance levels and empathizing with the patient and situation is important when dealing with children.\nTolerance  level  and  empathy  are  seldom-discussed concepts  in  dentistry,  and  they  vary  from  person  to person. As an illustration, consider the possible effect of Paul's behavior, which might be described as borderline  cooperative-uncooperative, on two different dentists. Dr. A. copes with Paul's whining with the attitude that  the  child  will  gain  confidence  and  eventually change. She ignores the whining and continues treatment. Dr. B., on the other hand, finds the whining highly irritating.  Because  it  is  bothersome  and  upsetting  to  the  entire  dental  team,  as  well  as  the    parent, Dr.  B.  manages  the  child  by  using  a  firm,    reassuring, positive voice control technique. The   dentists tolerated and reacted to the child's behavior quite differently. Yet both provided the treatment   successfully, even though their approaches to the problem were dissimilar. Their management  of  the  situation  was  governed  by  their individual tolerance levels.\nAs well as varying from person to person, tolerance levels  fluctuate  for  the  individual.  For  example,  an upsetting experience at home can affect the clinician's mood in the dental office. Some people are in a better frame of mind early in the morning, whereas the abilities of  others  to  cope  and  empathize  improve  as  the  day progresses. The important thing is for clinicians to know their  tolerance  levels.  Morning  people  should  instruct receptionists  to  book  behavior  problems  first  thing  in the morning. Learning to recognize factors that overtax tolerance levels is one way to avoid loss of self-control."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.6 Flexibility\nFour-year-old  Daniel  was  apprehensive  but  cooperative for his dental exam one week earlier. Now he has returned to the office for a restorative treatment. When the dentist entered the operatory and was about to begin treatment, Daniel said, 'I have to go to the bathroom.' The dentist questioned the boy's necessity and reluctantly acknowledged Daniel's need: 'OK, but hurry up!' Then he added, 'Be quick, we are already half an hour behind schedule.'\nCase 16.6, Discussion : Daniel may have had an urgent need, or he may have been delaying treatment. The dentist tried to determine the necessity and, failing to do so, allowed Daniel to go to the bathroom. To avoid this situation, patients should be asked to use the restroom before entering the treatment room and be told that during treatment it will be difficult to stop and go to the bathroom. However, Daniel was not prompted before  treatment  to  use  the  bathroom.  In  cases  such as  this,  the  child  has  to  be  given  the  benefit  of  the doubt. Sometimes, however, children use this ploy as a  means  of  delaying  treatment.  The  bathroom  incident  is  of  secondary  importance  in  this  case.  It  is included  here  to  point  out  another  important  principle when dealing with children: the dental team has to be flexible. Since it was not Daniel's fault that the office  was  operating  behind  schedule,  there  was  no reason to be impatient with him.\nChildren  are  children.  They  lack  the  maturity  of adults, and the dental team must be prepared to change its  plans  at  times.  A  child  may  begin  fretting  and squirming in the dental chair after half an hour, and the  proposed  treatment  may  have  to  be  shortened. Conversely, a dentist may plan an indirect temporary pulp  treatment  with  final  restoration  at  a  second appointment,  but  because  the  child  is    difficult,  the\nplan may have to be altered to complete the treatment in  one  session.  Sometimes  a  child  may  appear  for  a dental appointment out of sorts, with a low grade fever and stuffy nose that was unrecognized previously by a parent, and the dental appointment has to be terminated.\nThe  size  of  children  may  also  demand  a  change  in operating procedure. Many dentists, following accepted four-handed dentistry practices, work at the eleven or twelve o'clock position. This is not always possible with the  young  child  patient.  Thus,  the  dental  team  has  to change  with  each  situation,  and  flexibility  becomes  a necessary  ingredient  in  the  behavior  management  of children."

    "context_enriched_content": "Keys to effective Communication in a Pediatric office\nCommunications are used universally in pediatric dentistry.  Establishing  communication  with  the  pediatric patient helps alleviate fear and anxiety, builds a trusting  relationship  between  the  dental  team,  the  pediatric patient, and the parent, and aids in promoting the child's positive attitude toward oral health. The dental team must consider the  cognitive  development  of  the pediatric patient as  well  as  the  presence  of  other communication  deficits,  such  as  hearing  disorders, when communicating with  them  (AAPD  2012).  There are keys that help open and guide effective communication with children. These are:\n- The first rule is to establish communication. Engage the  child  in  conversation.  This  enables  the  dentist and the team to learn about the patient, and may relax the child.\n- Be sure that everyone acknowledges the lead communicator.  Members  of  the  dental  team  must  be aware  of  their  roles  when  communicating  with  a child, and at which point one person takes the lead over  the  other.  For  example,  the  dental  assistant starts engaging the child in conversation before the dentist arrives. Then, when the dentist arrives, the dentist takes over the lead and the assistant becomes an active listener. It is important that communication comes from one single source. If the parent is in the  operatory,  this  must  be  explained  in  advance. When the dentist is conversing with the child, the parent must be a silent observer and active listener. If multiple people  try to engage  the  child in conversation or give directions at the same time, it can be confusing for the child.\n- It is important that the message is simple and ageappropriate. When talking with children, use real-life descriptive examples to explain procedures.\n- Use the voice appropriately. A controlled alteration of  voice  volume,  tone,  or  pace  to  influence  and direct the patient's behavior is known as voice control. The objectives of voice control are to gain the patient's  attention  and  compliance,  avert  negative or  avoidance  behavior,  and  establish  appropriate adult/child roles.\n- Use  multisensory  communication.  In  addition  to spoken messages, nonverbal messages can be used with patients. Body contact such as a simple tap on the shoulder or a smile conveys a friendly feeling of warmth and reassurance. Eye contact is important. Children  that  avoid  eye  contact  may  not  be  fully prepared to cooperate. When talking with children, every effort should be made to speak at the child's eye level, rather than towering over them. Eye level communication  allows  for  a  friendlier  and  less authoritative or intimidating experience.\nThe foregoing are keys to communicating with children. There  are  others  as  well.  All  are  described  in  greater detail in the communication section of Chapter Six."

    "context_enriched_content": "training the Dental team\nThe  practice  of  pediatric  dentistry  is  a  team  effort, with the dentist leading and delegating responsibility to the pediatric dental staff (including trained dental auxiliaries and office personnel). Each pediatric dental auxiliary  and  office  staff  member  has  to  be  trained and should actively participate in the management of child behavior in the dental office (Wright 1975). The dental  auxiliaries  and  office  staff  members  must support  the  dentist's  efforts  to  welcome  the  patient and  parent  into  a  child-friendly  environment  and facilitate  behavior  guidance  and  a  positive  dental visit (AAPD 2012). The responsibility, or role, of individuals  varies  according  to  the  philosophies  and competency of those concerned.\nIn the Pediatric Dental Team Approach, everyone contributes.  The  pediatric  dentist  is  the  leader,  but  it  is important to note that this means giving the team members autonomy and empowerment. As Bill Gates said, 'As we look ahead to the next century, leaders will be those  who  empower  others'  (Aeker  and  Smith  2010). There are instances where  the dental assistant or hygienist may be the 'key' person in the control of the child's  behavior-instances  in  which  they  engage  the pediatric  patient  better  than  the  pediatric  dentist.  In such instances, it is important to give the dental auxiliary considerable  freedom  in  developing  rapport  with  the child. Research has shown that people working in selforganized teams are more satisfied, resulting in a more\npositive  work  environment  (Bharat  2007).  Research outside of dentistry also has found that happy individuals are much more likely to participate in activities that are adaptive for both them and the people around them. Positive  emotions  lead  people  to  produce  more  ideas and  think  more  creatively  and  flexibly,  which  in  turn encourages  imagination  and  enhances  social  relationships  (Aeker  and  Smith  2010).  Auxiliaries  need  to  be encouraged to contribute to this pleasant experience.\nDentistry  is  often  described  as  an  art  and  a  science. Both  are  important  when  bringing  a  team  together. Thus, a basic program for training a dental auxiliary to participate  in  the  management  of  child  behavior-a fundamental skill-is important. How each dental office or clinic engages and teaches their auxiliaries will vary, according to the educational background of the auxiliary. There  are  two  types  of  backgrounds  to  consider.  One type is the person who has been engaged because of a positive attitude and keen interest in children. These persons  need  to  be  taught  dental  assistant  skills  from  the bottom up. The second type is a certified dental assistant who has completed a formal dental assistant program. In  this  case,  begin  with  a  fresh  slate  and  share  with them the  importance  of  embracing  changes  and  flexibility.  Few  dental  assisting  training  programs  spend much time teaching behavior management. Additionally, ask  the  assistants  to  share  ideas  that  worked  well  in previous experiences. Foster an open-minded and flexible team culture by implementing the rules of behavior management. The keys to effective team communication not  only  work  with  pediatric  patients,  but  also  in training the pediatric team member. Personal communication between the dentist and the dental auxiliary is one of the most important and commonly used methods in training the dental auxiliary. Think of it as tell-show-do.\nAgain, be concrete, and have plans and protocols. The dentist must define each auxiliary's role and emphasize that the goal of pediatric dentistry is to positively guide infants, children, and adolescents through their dental experiences.  It  is  absolutely  essential  to  communicate expectations clearly to the auxiliary. The reason many staff  members  do  not  achieve  their  goals  or  become engaged team members is they have not be given clear or concrete instructions as to their role (Koestner 2002)."

This is usually based on what is learned  while  monitoring  a  staff  member's  progress (Aeker and Smith 2010). Regularly scheduled staff meetings for discussions of the philosophy of child management to which an office subscribes are exceedingly important. Such discussions provide an opportunity  for  an  individual  auxiliary  to  question  certain policies  and  methods,  and  to  more  clearly  understand their application. They also provide an opportunity for the entire staff to share in this understanding, which is absolutely essential. Dental auxiliaries demonstrating a team mentality and loyalty to the practice are important."

    "context_enriched_content": "the first non-emergent Parent encounter\nThe receptionist usually has the first contact with a prospective patient's parent when scheduling an appointment  over  the  telephone.  Since  parents  often  do  not know how to prepare their children for the first dental visit, it is the receptionist's to help 'set the stage.' The receptionist should provide information that helps the parent understand what to expect prior to an appointment, alleviating anxiety. This is done in several ways, such as a pre-appointment letter or through an office's web  page.  These  strategies  are  described  in  detail  in Chapter Six. All of these encounters serve as education tools that may answer questions, allay fears, and help the parent and child be better prepared for the first visit (AAPD 2012).\nThrough this initial contact with a parent, the receptionist  can  gain  important  information  to  prepare  the rest  of  the  pediatric  dental  team  for  the  new  patient encounter.  For  example,  is  this  the  child's  first  dental experience? If not, did the parent indicate that there had been problems in the past? Are other siblings treated in this office? Who referred the patient? It is the responsibility  of  the  receptionist  to  obtain  and  record  this information,  and  provide  it  to  the  team.  Figure  16-1 shows  a telephone information slip for recording information. (Figure 16-2 is a different telephone information slip that is used for the emergency patient.) A  receptionist  with  a  good  attitude  can  gain  much information and is extremely important because she is the  'preview'  of  the  office  staff  and  the  sole  contact before the new patient arrives."

For most children, a successful first-time scheduling procedure (followed by the authors) is to limit the appointment to an examination and radiographs, if indicated. A second appointment is made for a dental prophylaxis and fluoride treatment.  Having  two  separate  visits  allows  better evaluation of the child's behavior and greater opportunity to engage parents in prevention discussions and the  anticipatory  guidance  aspect  of  pediatric  oral health. By separating into two appointments, the focus is narrowed for each visit and positive experiences are enhanced for  the  parent  and  patient.  Narrowing  the goals  and  tasks  lead  to  better  participation  (Latham and Seigjts 1999) and increases the enjoyment of the tasks  (Bandura  and  Schunk  1981;  Manderlink  and Harackiewicz 1984).\nAlthough many pragmatic factors dictate office procedures,  the  schedule  itself  can  influence  the  child's cooperative behavior. Scheduling, appointment length, and time of day are important practical considerations of the child's treatment plan. Further, nobody likes  to  be  kept  waiting,  including  children. A  child kept  waiting  results  in  a  restless  patient;  thus,  there should  not  be  long  waiting  periods  in  the  reception area. It can have an adverse effect on the child and the parent.\nPediatric  dentists  have  to  determine  what  works best for them and their staff. Many dentists prefer to schedule young patients in the morning. In addition, many  dentists feel that by keeping age groups together (preschoolers in the morning, older children in  the  afternoon),  the  peer  groups  have  a  positive influence and the dental office runs more smoothly, with less psychological change of pace for the dental staff. Some  pediatric  dentists also prefer to see patients  with  behavior  problems  first  thing  in  the morning.  However,  the  issue  of  'tolerance  level' must be considered when scheduling. Does the dentist's tolerance level change  between  9 a.m.  and 5 p.m.? Since tolerance level affects dentist-child interactions, the attitudes of both the patient and the dentist  are  considered  when  selecting  appointment times.  The  authors  prefer  to  see  behavior  problems first in the morning, but a colleague of theirs prefers to wait until he has had his morning coffee! Different strokes for different folks.\nEveryone  on  the  pediatric  dental  team  wants  the patient  to  enter  the  office  calmly,  progress  through treatment easily, and leave the office happy. For this to occur, everything has to go well from beginning to end. The following case scenarios focus on the scheduling of the dental visit and their influence on the behavior of pediatric patients."

After a brief time, three-year-old Tina storms into the reception room following her treatment. Tina is visibly upset and crying.  This has been her history for the past two checkups. Now Johnny looks up at his mom and starts to tear up.\nCase 16.7, Discussion : Unfortunately, this problem can occur  in  the  dental  office.  It  is  termed  behavior  contagion.  Johnny  was  initially  sitting  beside  his  mom, waiting calmly. Tina, who was obviously upset by the dental experience, has adversely influenced Johnny, the next patient. If  the  waiting  child  is  a  new  patient,  the experience likely increases apprehension even more.\nTo avoid duplicating this type of situation, a good scheduling  guideline  dictates  that  a  first-time  child patient's appointment should follow the appointment of a child with a positive behavioral background. Then the child who exits happily from the dental   operatory can influence the new patient favorably. Perhaps the best way to avoid the problem is an office protocol that instructs  receptionists  or  booking  clerks  to  check  the behavior  of  each  patient  preceding  a  new  patient.  If the exiting child's behavior is positive, it could have a beneficial influence on that of the following child, especially  when the children are of the same sex and are closely matched in age."

After  waiting  in the crowded reception area for a half hour, the children became restless and began to chase each other around the  room.  An  argument  followed,  which  embarrassed Mrs. Jones and disturbed the other patients.\nCase 16.8, Discussion :  Children are bundles of energy. Lacking the patience of adults in an environment that was not designed to occupy their attention, the children in this case made up their own 'game.' How unusual is it for children to argue when they are confined in close quarters? The point is that adults may relax and read, but children become restless and tired, especially if there is nothing to occupy them. Beginning an appointment in this way can negatively affect the remainder of an office\nvisit.  This  is  especially  true  for  a  new  patient,  or  one who has demonstrated apprehension or uneasiness at earlier appointments.\nA good general rule is that a child should not be kept waiting  in  the  reception  area,  and  that  every  effort should be made to be on time. Years ago, Brauer (1964) pointed out that long waiting periods in the reception area  should  be  avoided  because  they  can  have  an adverse  effect  on  the  child  and  the  parents.  This  still holds true, and emphasizing the importance of staying on schedule and keeping the waiting periods for children as short as possible. The reception area may also be designed as a fun place for kids, with planned activities to  avoid  problems.  Fun  is  the  easiest  way  to  change behavior  for  the  better  (Ramos  2009).  Many  pediatric dentists provide separate areas for children, with activities such as television, video games, or play structures (see  Chapter  Seventeen).  Other  suggestions  are  children's  books,  toys,  fish  tanks,  blackboards,  building blocks, and small chairs and tables."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.9 Appointment Sequence\nCharlene,  age  three,  had  an  appointment  for  her  first dental  examination.  After  entering  the  operatory,  the child screamed and flailed about in the dental chair. With consent from the parent, the dentist used firm positive voice control to manage her behavior. The child ultimately cooperated  for  the  dental  examination,  but  additional treatments were required. At the front desk, the receptionist made Charlene an appointment for a month later.\nCase  16.9,  Discussion :  This  case  features  a  child  who misbehaves  or  is  apprehensive  and  who,  by  good behavior management, becomes cooperative. After establishing  rapport,  everything  went  well,  but  the scheduling of the next appointment increased the chance of the problem repeating itself. This patient should not have to wait for an extended period for the next office visit. Such a child should be rescheduled as soon as possible to reinforce the new-found positive attitude.\nBy  reducing  the  time  between  appointments,  the dental  team  uses  a  management  strategy  that  can  be called the 'rapid sequence' appointment technique. It is typically used in the following way for the apprehensive new patient without emergency treatment needs. At the first visit, the dentist expects to perform a clinical examination and to take radiographs, if indicated. The apprehensive child balks or is difficult.  Eventually,  the  child becomes more cooperative through proper management techniques, and the dentist examines the patient without problem. However, the dentist senses that the child is still quite apprehensive. This can be a good place to terminate the appointment and reschedule the patient for the indicated radiographs within two weeks. Delaying the radiographs  benefits  the  clinician  as  well  as  the  child.  It provides the clinician the opportunity to build the child's confidence  and  reassess  the  behavior  before  treatment. The patient leaves the office after the first visit believing that  the  task  was  accomplished,  which  promotes  the child's pride and autonomy.\nIt was previously mentioned that the authors separate the  first  examination  and  prophylaxis procedures into two  shorter  appointments.  In  this  case,  children  who experience the rapid sequence appointment   technique usually  perform  well  upon  returning  for  radiographs. Often they display little or no apprehension at the second visit. They have been led slowly through the dental experience.  Parents  usually    appreciate  the  little  extra time taken to develop a positive attitude in their children, especially when the situation is explained to them.\nThe rapid sequence appointment technique is a form of behavior modification that desensitizes the anxious child. From the clinician's viewpoint, this strategy may be too time-consuming, and therefore impractical. If carried to an extreme, this may be true. However, many first-time child patients exhibiting anxieties accommodate quickly, and they are entitled to be led through initial dental experiences slowly. In the long run, taking time to desensitize the patient offers great dividends to the clinician.\nFurther,  when  a  long  series  of  restorative  appointments have taken place, the final appointment should be brief, and simple procedures should be planned. In this way, the child leaves the dental office awaiting the recall visit with a good feeling."

Despite his knowledge that Alice often naps in the late morning, the dentist recommended an early morning appointment.\nCase  16.10,  Discussion :  Consider  this  case  carefully. The sedation was supposed to relax and calm the child, facilitating a lengthy treatment. However, the scheduling of the appointment may be in error because children who are  accustomed  to  late  morning  naps  frequently  have\nhigher  activity  levels  early  in  the  morning.  Thus,  both children's behaviors and dentists' management   strategies have to be taken into account in the daily office schedule.\nIf a child is accustomed to napping late in the morning, she is likely to require less sedation, or at least respond better  to  the  sedation  prescribed,  if  her  appointment  is scheduled near her napping period. Again, the scheduled appointment  can  influence  the  behavior  management. Although  many  dentists  encourage  morning  appointments for children, some situations necessitate changes in the office schedule."

Returning  for  a  recall  appointment,  it  was discovered  that  he  needed  restoration  on  two  of  his newly  erupted  upper  first  permanent  molars  and  sealants on his two lower permanent first molars. The dentist    recommended  that  Jeffrey  have  three  half-hour appointments-one  appointment  for  each  restorative filling and one appointment for the sealants.\nCase  16.11,  Discussion :  Why  was  the  cooperative patient  given  three  appointments?  Would  one  long appointment (one hour) or two appointments (45 minutes each) be better, or would they be too long? Scheduling appointment length is variable. It often depends on the patient's current behavior and temperament.\nImproved  technology,  the  application  of  time,  and motion studies by efficiency experts have altered today's current  dental  practices.  Nowadays,  the  tendency  is  to treat the patient quickly and effectively while maintaining  concern  for  patient  comfort,  health,  and  time.  This change in approach conforms to the definition of behavior management proposed in the introductory chapter of this book.  This  definition  included  the  terms  'effectively' and 'efficiently.' Given this patient's history, there is little doubt that treatment could be accomplished in one or two sessions. Only a few studies have concentrated on appointment  duration.  Those  few,  however,  note  that appointments lasting one half hour to one hour are not detrimental to a child's behavior."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parental Presence/Absence\nParent involvement, especially in their children's health care, has changed dramatically in recent years. It is important  to  understand  the  changing  emotional  needs  of parents because of the growth of a latent but natural sense to  be  protective  of  their  children.  Practitioners  should become accustomed to this added involvement of parents and welcome their questions and concerns for their children. They should consider parents' desires and wishes, and be open to a paradigm shift in their own thinking (AAPD 2012). Currently, many clinicians design operatories to accommodate parents (see Chapter Seventeen).\nThere  is  little  agreement  in  practitioner  philosophy regarding parents' presence or absence during pediatric dental treatment. Surveys on the topic in the 1970s were almost unanimous in reporting that parents should not accompany  their  children  into  the  dental  operatory. There were, of course, exceptions, such as for the toddler, the special needs patient, and so forth. However, beginning  in  the  1980s,  surveys  found  an  increasing number of practitioners allowing parents into the dental operatory with their children (see Chapter Four). Nowadays, it is becoming more and more common for the parent-child pairing to remain together."

    "context_enriched_content": "Gifts and Tangible Reinforcements\nGiving gifts or prizes to children has become a fact of commercial life in North America and almost throughout the world. There is general agreement on the merit of this practice in the dental office, for gift-giving can serve as a reward. If the gift has dental significance (such as a toothbrush  kit),  it  also  serves  as  a  reinforcement  for dental health.\nIt is very important that the various trinkets in a toy chest are used as tokens of affection for children-not as bribes. A bribe is a promise to induce positive behavior. A  token  of  affection  reward  is  recognition  of  good behavior  after  completion  of  the  operation,  without  a previously implied promise. What Finn called a bribe in 1973, Pink calls a 'contingent' reward in his 2009 book, Drive-The  Surprising  Truth  About  What  Motivates  Us . This is how a contingent reward sounds: 'if you do this, then you will get that.' Contingent rewards, or bribes, can have negative effects-they require people to forfeit some of their autonomy (Pink 2009). Studies have shown that when contingent rewards are given to control a person's behavior, they can do long-term damage.\nDeci and colleagues re-analyzed nearly three decades of studies on the subject of rewards. After carefully considering  reward  effects  in  128  experiments,  they  concluded that tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative  effect  on  intrinsic  motivation  when  focused short-term  to  controlling  behavior  (Deci  et  al.  1999). Gift-giving  practices  which  are  not  'contingent'  or bribe-based can have spectacular results. Many children who seem tense during operative procedures suddenly perk up upon completion, eager for a gift. These gifts provide  a  pleasant  reminder  of  the  appointment.  It  is\nFigure 16-3. It is always special when a member of the dental team accompanies the child to the gift box and praises her while she selects her prize.\nalways  special  when  a  member  of  the  dental  team accompanies the  child  to  the  gift  box  and  praises  her while she selects her prize (see Figure 16-3)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Wearing Apparel\nWhen it comes to apparel for the dental team, there has been  concern  that  professional  clothing  worn  by  the dentist  can  increase  anxiety  in  children  because  fears may be transferable from one situation to another unrelated  encounter.  For  example,  if  a  child  had  previous poor  experiences  with  a  professional  in  a  white  coat (who could be a physician or a barber), it is possible that these fears could be generalized to the dental environment. The uniform can be common to all. Similarly, children who have been exposed to prior surgical procedures might be frightened by a face mask. Investigating this potential  problem,  Siegel  et  al.  (1992)  suggested  that wearing  a  mask  during  dental  treatment  represents  a minimal stressor for the young child, but recommended introducing  the  child  to  the  dental  environment  and experience without the use of a protective mask.\nWearing  apparel  can  conceivably  influence  both patients and professional staff. Studying the issue in a dental faculty, Mistry (2009) found that parents favored traditional dress, as it gives an air of professionalism.  Children,  however,  preferred  dental  students  in  casual  attire. All  are  not  in  agreement  with this view. Kuscu and colleagues (2009) examined the preference  in  attire  of  827  Istanbul  school  children eight  to  fourteen  years  of  age.  The  children  were shown photos of dentists wearing different clothing. Almost half  of  the  children  selected  formal  attire  as their choice for dentists' wearing apparel. The study does  not  support  the  popular  view  that  white  coats raise anxiety levels in children.\nAn investigation by Austin et al. (1991) surveyed the wearing  apparel  of  women  dentists  with  a  questionnaire. Based upon the replies of 928 of 2000 women, only 51% felt  the  need  to  wear  a  lab  coat  over  their  street clothes.  Interestingly,  women  dentists  reporting  the highest gross incomes were more likely to wear street clothes  without  a  lab  coat.  The  study  suggested  that dressing for success and infection control was a professional issue.\nWhat to wear in the clinic is not only a dental issue. Troung  et  al.  (2006)  reported  that  physicians  wearing standard precautions attire in the pediatric emergency\ndepartment need to be aware that this apparel may negatively impact their relationship with pediatric patients four to eight years of age. In terms of the effect of physician dress style on patient confidence, patients of all ages who consulted with physicians in a hospital or private practice  had  the  most  confidence  in  a  physician  who wore a professional white coat (Maruani et al. 2012)."

These  guidelines  were  updated  in  2004 and  again  in  2012.  The  development  and  progress  of many oral conditions are associated with a patent's age, stage of dental development, and vulnerability to known risk factors.

While the dentist is responsible for ordering the number and type  of  X-ray  required,  auxiliary  personnel  who  take X-rays in a dental office should be aware of the guidelines.  They should know how many and what type of films are to be used. Consider the following case."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.12 Film Selection\nCora, a lovely four-year-old, was referred to a pediatric dentist  as  a  management  problem. While  the  previous dentist  had  obtained  radiographs,  they  were  of  poor quality and the had child refused to have them re-taken. The  alert  dental  assistant  immediately  recognized  the problem-the previous dentist used bitewing films, size number 2.\nCase  16.12,  Discussion :  Personnel  taking  radiographs need to know what type of films to use, and it is the dentist's responsibility to ensure that staff members know the procedures.  In  this  case,  the  child  likely  was  hurt  by the type 2 radiographs. Large radiographs also could have caused her to gag. A good rule is that type 0 films should be used at least until the first permanent molars erupt.\nThe young patient has to be re-trained. New expectations have to be developed. It is important to point out that  'things  are  different  here.'  In  accordance  with leaning theory, the stimulus has to be altered to get a different  response.  One  way  is  to  begin  by  taking  an anterior occlusal radiograph (Figure 16-4). This type of film  generally  does  not  cause  gagging  and  is  easy  to obtain. It also allows the clinician to assess the cooperative  behavior.  An  important  teaching  technique  is  to begin  with  an  easy  task  (the  occlusal  film)  and,  once successful, increase the difficulty of the tasks (the bitewings).  In  addition,  show  the  child  the  size  of  the radiograph from the former dental office and compare it  to  the  type  0  film  that  you  intend  to  use.  Have  the child  hold  the  films.  Be  sure  to  keep  repeating,  'See, things are different here.'\nIf  there  is  difficulty  taking  a  bitewing  film,  a  Rinn holder can help. While it may not provide a good view of  the  furcation  regions,  it  is  adequate  for  diagnosing proximal  caries.  In  this  case,  in  order  to  gain  Cora's confidence, she needs to be convinced again that 'things are  different  here.' A  more  detailed  description  of  retraining procedures can be found in Chapter Six.\nAnother consideration should be made when switching  over  to  digital  radiography.  Two  basic  techniques are available to obtain digital images: the direct method using  an  electronic  receptor,  called  a  sensor,  and  the indirect  method,  which  uses  a  semi-indirect  sensor called  a  photostimulable  phosphor  plate  (PSP)  and scanner (Figure 16-5). The direct sensor may either be cordless or, in many instances, have a fiber optic cable attached. The sensor is quite bulky and although it may be  similar  in  size  to  conventional  film,  its  dimensions are not identical. In addition to its increased thickness, the plastic protective cover and cord may be uncomfortable  for    toddlers  and  young  children.  PSP  plates  are very thin and are available in sizes that match conventional  film.  The  PSP  system  may  be  more  suitable  for pediatric  dentistry:  the  thin,  flexible  plates  are  almost equal to X-ray films. The protective sleeve covers do not add any bulkiness to the plate. In addition, during bitewing exposures, the conventional bitewing tab may be affixed to the plate (Figure 16-6). The only disadvantage of PSP plates is that when taking occlusal radiographs, the child is asked to bite down on the plate, potentially damaging it. A useful clinical tip is to protect the plate for the occlusal view with a plastic cover found in packages of routine films.\nIt should be noted that the authors use the direct sensor  method  successfully,  and  when  switching  over  to digital radiography, the clinician will ultimately decide which method is best for the dentist's individual style and needs.\nSuccessfully introducing youngsters to radiographic procedures  involves  both  the  science  and  the  art  of behavior  management.  Explaining  and  demonstrating to  patients,  as  well  as  answering questions and modifying  procedures,  are  all  parts  of  the  art  of  behavior management."

Examples,  instructions,  and  explanations should incorporate words and objects familiar to the patient, with as much repetition as necessary to acclimate the child to the procedure. Lengthy, complicated procedures should be broken down into steps for easier communication. When the child performs as instructed, praise is necessary to positively reinforce the desirable behavior.  However,  the  praise  should  be  specific:  for example, 'You are a good patient. You sat still.'\nFigure 16-6. For bitewings, a simple bitewing tab may be used with PSP plates (left) versus the sensor (right), which is used with a bitewing holder or bite block. Courtesy of Dr. Ari Kupietzky.\nThe behavior-shaping procedure, although similar to the tell-show-do method, employs more concepts from learning theory. For instance, the child who is told about the radiographic equipment, shown the equipment, and then  looks  away  may  be  telling  the  operator  that  he is  not  prepared  to  cooperate.  In  this  case,  attempts  to shape  behavior  by  returning  to  the  'tell'  portion  of the procedure (i.e., the most distant approximation) may\nbe helpful: 'Michael, do you remember what I told you? I have a big camera to take pictures of your teeth. Please look over here so that I can show it to you. See it? Good!'\nBehavior  shaping  entails  successive  approximations of  desired  behavior.  Therefore,  the  dental  assistant would  not  begin  taking  radiographs  until  the  child heard,  saw,  or  touched  as  instructed.  Only  after  the desired  behavior  has  come  about  should  the  next approximation occur. Thus, reciprocal interaction is an important  feature  of  any  behavior-shaping  procedure, and  the  dental  team  member  has  to  observe  a  child patient's reactions closely.\nThe  following  description for introducing radiographs  begins  by  placing  the  protective  apron  on  the child. Radiographs are then placed in the child's hand. Thus, the patient is involved in the procedure. The dentist or dental auxiliary might say: 'These are like paper' (if  film)  or,  'These  are  like  a  memory  stick'  (if  direct hard sensors are used). 'They make pictures for your teeth.  Can  you  count  them  for  me  to  see  that  I  have enough? Can you pick out the biggest ones? Good, you are a smart boy, Mike!'\nEvery attempt is made to relax the child (patients tend to  gag  when  not  relaxed).  Since  most  children  like  to touch  and  feel  things,  the  dental  assistant  may  allow them to hold the radiographs. Permitting the youngster to count the films and select the larger ones also helps the  clinician  estimate  a  child's  developmental  level. A four-year-old  patient  who  counts  the  four  films  and selects the large ones is probably a capable child."

    "context_enriched_content": "Case 16.12 Film Selection\nAgain,  the  child  is  introduced  to  the  radiographic equipment with explanations from the dental assistant, such as the following: 'I use a big camera. Do you ever have your picture taken at home? Yes? Well, my camera is  a  little  different.  Look,  it  has  a  long  neck  and  a  big head.' Children have vivid imaginations and like to use them. 'Here is its nose' (indicating the cone). Most children will look at the cone carefully. 'I see that you are looking at its nose. Look up there. Can you see anything? No? Good! I wouldn't want anything to get in the way of your nice pictures.'\nSince radiographic technique differs from home photography, a suitable explanation is offered. 'When you take tooth pictures, it is a little different from home pictures. The camera moves beside your face (showing the child). It doesn't, but it makes a funny noise (buzz and a beep) as it takes the picture. Also, the picture has to be in your mouth, not in the camera' (pointing to a location in the child's mouth).\nIn behavior shaping, the 'tell' and 'show' portions of the technique often go hand in hand. Modeling can be an important part of the showing procedure: 'Let me show you how I like the children to do it' ( Figure 16-7). The  dental  assistant  can  demonstrate  film  and  X-ray\nFigure 16-7. Tell-show-do: The dental assistant is showing the patient the protective apron.\nmachine placement on herself, or a model of a dentition can be used for this purpose. Since an X-ray machine is large and can frighten a young child patient, it should be introduced  slowly.  Rapid  movements  or  unexpected noises should be avoided. If a specific room is used for radiographs,  poster-sized  pictures  showing  children having radiographs can be helpful. The objective of the entire process is to shape the child's behavior, which is brought about by a series of successive approximations.\nOne common question that preschoolers ask is, 'Why do you use the blanket?' (meaning the lead apron). An understandable  response  might  be,  'Because  I  only want to take pictures of your teeth. I don't want your tummy to get in the picture.' Another common question is,  'Why  do  you  go  out  of  the  room  (or  move  away) when  you  take  the  picture?'  Two  logical  responses could be 'So that I do not get in the picture' or 'Because I have to go over here to press the button for the camera.' Explanations such as these, made at a level children can comprehend,  usually  satisfy  curiosity.  For  older  children, these answers will not suffice. They appreciate a brief explanation of radiation hygiene, which also demonstrates the dental team's concern for them.\nWhen it is time to take the radiographs, the child is involved  in  a  potentially  pleasant  learning  situation: 'Could you please pick out the biggest picture film and give it to me? Thanks. Mike, first I want to take a picture of your front teeth. Did you know that this picture can show me where your new teeth are? After I take the pictures,  I  will  show  you  where your new teeth are, and maybe we can tell when they will come in for you.'\nTaking the X-ray, the dental assistant places the film or  sensor  in  the  child's  mouth  and  says,  'Close  your teeth  and  hold  the  picture  like  a  cookie,  please.'  It  is important for instructions to be brief, straightforward, and at the child's level of comprehension: 'Good, now I will bring the camera nose near your nose to take the\npicture.' The dental assistant, backing away from the camera  says,  'Hold  still  and  I  will  take  the  picture. Don't move. Smile!' Many children grin when told to smile. This also facilitates positioning of the film. The analogy between home photography and radiography is  maintained.  Following  the  first  film,  the  child  is rewarded socially. The appropriate behavior is reinforced by verbal cues such as 'Great!' and smiles from the office staff."

While  the  child  rummages through the films, the operator explains, 'We took a picture of your upstairs front teeth. Now I will take one of your downstairs front teeth. Did you know that you had upstairs  and  downstairs  teeth?'  While  many  young children  laugh  at  this  dental  description,  they  understand. It is at their level of comprehension.\nFor a posterior bitewing or periapical view, a film tab or holding instrument is used. This, too, must be introduced to the child: 'Look, Mike, when I take pictures of back  teeth,  I  use  a  holder.  It  holds  pictures.  See  my holder? I will put it in your mouth now, and you can bite on it. Great, you bit hard! Now I need the holder back' (removing it). 'I put the picture in the holder so that it is easy for you to bite on.'

While  panoramic  radiographs  or  extraoral bitewings are not difficult procedures, some children are  alarmed  when they first  see  the  equipment. For this reason, the panoramic radiographic equipment should be explained by the dental assistant before it is shown to  a  child.  Children  can  be  told  that  they  are going to have their picture taken in a 'space machine' and that they are not to be the space pilots. While positioning  children  (Figure  16-8),  they  are  told  that  it  is very  important  to  hold  still  and  that  the  big  'space head' will move around them but not touch them. It is helpful to have smaller children stand on a stool (see Figure 16-9). A dry run can be made with the radiation turned  off  on  most  machines.  Because  the  length  of time  that  the  patient  must  sit  still  is  considerably greater  then  with  standard  radiographic  techniques, constant voice contact provides security to the young patient.  When  taking  panoramic,  extraoral  bitewings or  intraoral  radiographs  on  bright,  curious  children, the dental assistant should expect questions and provide suitable explanations.\nFigure 16-8.

    "context_enriched_content": "the Dental office Chapter 17\nJonathon E. Lee\nBrian D. Lee\nGerald Z. Wright\nAri Kupietzky\nWhen  the  pediatric  dentistry  (pedodontic)  treatment triangle was first described, one corner of that triangle featured the 'dentist, dental staff, and the office environment.'  Despite  the  recognition  of  its  importance, little has been written about the office environment in the pediatric dental literature, yet young pediatric dentists, graduate students, and residents spend countless hours thinking about their future dental offices, dwelling on what should and what should not go into their offices.\nOne  of  the  first  to  recognize  the  importance  of  the office environment was Dr. Walter Doyle, who teamed up with the architect Sarah Tait to co-author one of the first  publications  featuring  office  design  in  a  pediatric dental  text.  They  wrote  that  designing  an  office  was analogous to planning a city. Two of the innovations that they  stressed  were  an  office  that  would  be  open  and flowing, with few doors and a multi-chair open operatory concept. Tait and Doyle (1975) wrote the   following to encourage dentists to think about their office.\nWhat is dental environment?.................. A place that allows teeth to grow and change in a healthy way.\nWhat is dental environment?.................. A place that allows the child to grow and change in a healthy way.\nWhat is dental environment?.................. A place that allows the doctor's staff to grow and change in a healthy way individually and collectively.\nWhat is dental environment?................... A place capable of its own growth and change with respect to the life it sustains and maintains.\nSince  the 'special  effects'  created  within  pediatric dental offices can be critical to some patients' attitudes, the  office  environment  can  be  an  important  part  of behavior management. But it is only the starting point. Behavior  management  also  involves  numerous  techniques and strategies. It requires skills in communication, empathy, coaching, and listening. Having an office that accommodates these management techniques and strategies is part of the 'art' of behavior management. There are many types of pediatric dental offices. Some could be considered basic, while others might be called 'glitzy.'  Some  offices  are  designed  for  more  than  one dentist; some might be designed for numerous dentists, hygienists,  or  expanded-duty  dental  assistants.  The point  of  this  chapter  is  to  identify  features  that  are unique to pediatric dental offices.\nPediatric dental offices are unique. That is why many hours are spent thinking about the office. Be cautious when selecting an office designer or consultant. A traditional  dental  supply  company  may  suggest  a  design based upon a standard template. Relatively few office designers  appreciate  or  understand  the  needs  of  a pediatric  dentist.  When  designing  an  office,  several important questions need to be asked.\n- Does  the  image  that  your  office  projects  promote cooperative  patient  behavior  and  patient-parent acceptance?\n- Is  the  space  provided  sufficient  for  the  optimal function of the practice?\n- Does the office make it possible to use management techniques appropriately?\n- Does the office permit you to practice in the style that most suits you?\nOffice designers may not focus on these issues. To attract young dentists, the focus is often a financial one. Sales    pitches  are  often  along  the  lines  of  'We  design high-  performance offices,' or 'Let us increase your\nproductivity through a good design.' No one denies the importance  of  earning  a  good  living.  However,  treating patients properly, using appropriate management techniques with care and understanding, should lead to that outcome.\nPatients differ. Dentists differ. And, offices differ."

    "context_enriched_content": "reception, Waiting, and Play areas.\nThe reception, waiting, and play areas are interconnected, and each requires a great deal of planning. They are critical  to  the  office  operation-they  are  like  a  store  front window.  They  set  the  tone  for  the  office  and  create expectations for both the children and their parents.\nPatients should see the receptionist counter as soon as they enter so they don't feel lost. In turn, the receptionist should be able to see all patients, no matter where they are seated, so nobody is forgotten. All pathways should be  wide  enough,  and  the  receptionist's  counter  low enough, for children in wheelchairs. When determining how big the waiting room should be, one should take into account that pediatric patients tend to visit the dentist as families. Often one patient will be accompanied by  parents,  siblings,  and  sometimes  even  friends.  For example, a general practice office waiting room size calculation would be:\n1. Determine  the  number  of  patients  expected  to  be seen  during  the  busiest  hour,  multiplied  by  2.5  to account for accompanying relatives and friends.\n2. Subtract the number of exam rooms-that is, how many chairs will be needed.\n3. Next,  multiply  the  number  of  chairs  by  20  square feet (1.86 m 2 ).\nAccordingly, a solo practice with three exam rooms that peaks  at  six  patients  per  hour  should  plan  on  a 240-square-foot (22 m 2 ) waiting room with twelve chairs. A pediatric dental office would need even more space.\nWhen considering play areas, do not begin with the numbers game. Play can happen intensely in 1 square foot or in 1000 square feet. Maybe the first question to ask is, 'What will the play experience mean within the framework  of  the  child's  experience  in  this  dental office?' Is play a diversion from the dental experience, or a simulation? Is it an introduction to the dental experience? What are the limitations of the play experience? Is the noise undesirable? Should the play be segregated from  other  areas?  Is  play  a  potential  resource  for  the pediatric dental office that is vitally concerned with preventive and   interceptive dentistry? Are parents involved in the play area? Is the atmosphere of the waiting room one  of  calmness,  or  perhaps  excitement?  Should  the child  waiting  for  an  appointment  be  stimulated  by  a video  game-perhaps  magnifying  hyperactivity-or should their time in the waiting room be relaxing and calming? The play area is a potential resource, for not only play, but for learning and behavior management. Make the most of it.\nExcellent  products  are  exhibited  at  dental  meetings for waiting and/or play areas. How will they fit in the dental office? Will they cater to older children and teens, or will they be used by younger children or preschoolers? When thinking  about  the  play  area,  several  considerations are:\n- The space has to be developmentally appropriate.\n- The safety factor is a prime consideration.\n- All toys or products should be hygienic.\n- Equipment should be tough and long-lasting.\nWith these thoughts in mind, consider Figure 17-1. This waiting room area was designed with many of the elements mentioned above, and includes a reading section, a   toddler/young child play area, and a teenager video game corner. Figure 17-2 is another example of a waiting area that   accommodates both children and their parents. The play area is designed for younger children and preschoolers, and is separated from the general sitting area. A novel approach to waiting room play areas is a 'cave' for children. Toys, games, and magic mirrors all can be contained within the cave (Figure 17-3). The area within the cave may be room-sized or significantly smaller. Its function is to allow a division between the play area and the general waiting area. In addition, it gives the children a sense of privacy and fun. The cave concept can also be used in smaller offices with limited space; prefabricated play houses are commercially available and serve the same purpose.\nFigure 17-1. This waiting room area design has many elements mentioned in the text, including a reading section, a toddler/young child play area, and a teenager video game corner, which is isolated by glass."

Sounds of children playing may not only be a nuisance to other patients in the waiting room, but also may disrupt and interfere with the receptionist  and  front  desk.  It  is  also  advisable  for  an  office employee to be able to see the play area, since many parents may allow their children to play unsupervised.\nGames may be divided into non electronic/electronic, younger/older children-oriented, physically interactive, or  passive.  Electronic  games  may  be  touchscreen  or include  handheld  joy  sticks  or  steering  wheels.  They may be enclosed in protective casings to prolong their working life. Touchscreens have the advantage of being more user-friendly and less likely to break.\nTo encourage child-parent interaction, a reading corner may  be  constructed  (Figure  17-5).  The  use  of  display shelves similar to book store displays is suggested to make the books more desirable (Figure 17-6).

Lastly, a simple drawing corner with old-fashioned crayons and markers can be set up easily.  Patients  may  be  encouraged  to  present  their drawing to the dentist and have it proudly displayed on a designated bulletin board.\nThe waiting room area may also be used for practice management. An  informational  video  may  be  played constantly  played  for  parents  and  children.  The  film may  present  office  policies  and  services.  A  computer kiosk can be used to fill out medical history and other forms electronically, which are then submitted directly into the computer network. It goes without saying that WiFi internet access should be available in this area for the use and benefit of parents and patients.\nFigure 17-5.

Many themes, like the jungle, space, or medieval castles,  appeal  to  children  of  different  ages.  Using  a theme often makes it easier to decorate, since the design has a clear direction. However, a theme can become outdated relatively fast. Some people choose to have a multigenerational  and  timeless  theme,  which  provides  an environment for all age groups, including parents."

    "context_enriched_content": "hallway Designs\nBelcher (1898) was the first to write that children should be separated from their parents for the first visit. Parents were told that it was against 'office policy' for them to accompany their children into the operatory. Until about 1980, this became an inviolate rule for many. Although the no-parent policy  generally  has  changed  (as  discussed  in  Chapter Four), it still continues in some practices. Nonetheless, contemporary  practice  surveys  have  shown  the  trend  is  for parents  to  accompany  children  into  the  operatory ,  especially during the first visit. Now, more than ever, they form a greater part of the pediatric dentistry treatment triangle.\nDental  offices  have  to  be  designed  to  accommodate current trends. Typical of the open office design is the 'Z' shaped  hallway  connecting  the  reception/waiting  area with the treatment areas (Figures 17-7 and 17.8). Interestingly,  dentists  with  this  type  of  hallway  design notice that children tend to wander into the clinical area\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 17-6.

Parents, too, seem more relaxed and tend to remain in the reception area after one or two visits. They take comfort knowing that their  children  are  not  behind  closed  doors  and  can often hear their children interacting with the dental team. A writing board may be strategically placed on a wall within the Z hallway. Children are attracted to the writing board.  They  play,  write,  or  draw  (teeth!)  before  their dental  appointment,  and  sometimes  leave  messages  of thanks to the dental team as they leave the office. In some offices,  a  pocket  door  is  installed  along  the  hallway.  If excessive noise results from an uncooperative child in the treatment area, the door can be drawn closed."

Entering an  operatory  and  placing  a  child  immediately  in  the\nFigure 17-9.

Becker, Hays and Hayes. Bremerton, WA.\ndental chair can be a frightening experience. Pediatric dentists  now  prefer  that  the  first  visit  take  place  in  a non-treatment room. Such a room serves as a bridge between  the  reception/waiting  area  and  the  treatment areas (Figure 17-9). A bridging room is much more than the traditional consultation room. It is a multi-purpose room for performing:\n- the functional inquiry\n- examination  of  very  young  children  in  a  knee-toknee position\n- implementation of pre-appointment strategies\n- demonstration of management techniques\n- demonstration of oral hygiene procedures\nTo accommodate these functions, a bridging room has to be slightly larger than the traditional consultation room and must be equipped properly. If knee-to-knee examinations are performed, then appropriate seating for parent and child as well as examining instruments, a wash basin, and appropriate lighting is needed. If pre-appointment techniques are intended, then audio-visual equipment  or  modeling  dolls  have  to  be  available.  If  oral hygiene instruction is given in this room, then supplies need to be available. It is helpful to have the oral hygiene\nFigure 17-10. Oral hygiene area: note the age-appropriate counter levels.\nFigure  17-11. Oral  hygiene  area  for  a  large  'jungle'-themed  office.

In summary, a bridging room serves many important functions in the dental office, and some offices have more than one.\nAn  alternative  to  the  bridging  room,  especially  for offices with limited floor space, is the concept of 'bridging chairs' (Figure 17-12). Using this concept, two colored chairs are placed in the treatment room opposite the doorway. The patient is invited into the room and immediately asked to choose a chair. The child is pleasantly surprised that she is not asked to sit in the dental chair.  The  parent  sits  next  to  the  child  in  the  second chair.  The  patient  is  happy  to  sit  on  the  regular  chair, eyeing the imposing dental chair. Other children may react by saying they want to sit on the big chair (since they were told not to sit on it). The initial contact and communication is made with the patient by facing the child  sitting  on  the  regular  chair.  Eventually  the  child moves on to the dental chair. However, the warming-up period is done with the dental chair in view. This is an advantage over a bridging room, where the child may begin  to  feel  at  ease  and  is  then  asked  to  move  into another room. This method also works well with infant visits. In such instances, the infant sits on a parent's lap on  a  regular  chair  and  a  knee-to-knee  examination  is performed (See Figure 5-4 in Chapter Five)."

    "context_enriched_content": "treatment areas\nSurveys have shown a change in the parent-accompanying-child  trend.  Traditionally,  US  dentists  treated children alone and the parent waited in the reception area. However, while surveying southeastern United States pediatric dentists, Carr and Wilson (1999) noted that the majority of pediatric dentists allowed parents in the operatory. The main reasons for the change were parental influences and legal and ethical concerns of the practitioners. An AAPD survey of members (Adair et al. 2004) found that parental presence in the operatory appeared to be a common practice for some procedures, but not all. Parental presence in the operatory seems more widespread outside of the United States (Crossley and Joshi 2001). Most UK pediatric dentists (80%)   supported parental accompaniment during the course of treatment. Since modern dental operatories need  to  accommodate  parents  in  a  contemporary office,  the  pediatric  operatory  will  need  more  floor space  than  the  general  dentist's  treatment  room.  In addition to the patient, one or two assistants, and the dentist, space will be needed for one or two parents and sometimes an accompanying sibling, and possibly a baby stroller.\nTreatment areas have to be designed for children with cooperative behavior, potentially cooperative behavior, and those who lack cooperative abilities. Designs have changed  greatly  over  the  past  twenty-five  years,  and they differ significantly from those of most general dentists in some interesting ways.\nMany pediatric  dental  offices  feature  open  operatories, as opposed to closed operatories. An open operatory contains space for treating several children at one time. Both a dentist and a dental hygienist may be treating patients at the same time. Concomitant treatments offer  an  opportunity  for  children  to  learn  from  one another, and it can be very efficient. The degree of separation between patient chairs may vary with the practitioner's  philosophy  and  style.  Walls  between  patient chairs  may  be  just  high  and  long  enough  to  screen patients from each other when seated upright, as well as reclined (Figure 17-13). This configuration allows the clinician to monitor the remaining treatment chairs while\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFigure 17-12.

Richland, WA.\nseated at the head of the patient, and it may be ideal for the  pediatric  or  orthodontic  practice  (Unthank  2006). Other designs include counters as partitions, or no separation at all (Figure 17-14).\nSome have questioned the benefit of the open operatory,  suggesting  that  it  may  upset  children.  Indeed, research  by  Ishikawa  et  al.  (1990)  found  that  children can  be  bothered  by  exposure  to  crying  and  that  the younger age groups (children under four years of age) tend to be bothered more than older age groups. It is incumbent upon a pediatric dentist to recognize that not all  children  will  benefit  from  an  open  operatory.  If  a child  cries  in  an  open  operatory  and  could  possibly upset  a  younger  patient  nearby,  the  clinician  should explain  to  the  observing  child  what  is  occurring,  and why.  Make  it  a  learning  experience.  Conversely,  it  is believed that many children benefit from being in the\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 17-15.

    "context_enriched_content": "treatment areas\nMany offices limit the bay area to recall examinations and dental prophylaxis, orthodontics, and sealant placement. Some dentists also have an issue with taking X-rays in open bay areas. However, as long as patients and staff are separated from the X-ray source by at least six feet or the required local regulation, conventional open bay pass-through X-ray heads or hand held X-ray systems can be used in the open bay operatory (Figure 17-15).\nPersonal  preferences  often  dictate  operatory  design. There are dentists who prefer the privacy of an individual, closed  operatory.  Additionally,  some  parents  do  not appreciate what may appear to them to be an assemblyline mode of treatment used in open bay areas. The dentist's attention is seen as being directed more toward the other patients and less toward their own child.\nFigure  17-16. The  cart  system  is  most  suitable  for  children. This  cart  is side-positioned.\nAnother  point  regarding  the  treatment  room  is  the choice  of  dental  unit  delivery  system  (Figure  17-16). The dental unit can either be supplied as a cart or an over-the-patient arm. Each system has advantages and disadvantages, and one may be more suitable for a pediatric practice. The over-the-patient delivery system is the most commonly used in general practice dental clinics today  (Georgetown  University  2011).  It  allows  for  an efficient use of space, and both the dentist and the dental assistant have immediate access to the switches and/or instruments.  However,  there  are  drawbacks  to  this system in a pediatric practice. The array of visible instruments may upset children and make them feel confined, and if a child is aggressive they could harm themselves with the instruments and the bar over the chair.\nThe cart system seems most suitable for children. The dental  chair  is  not  surrounded  by  frightening  instruments; rather, it is simple and non-threatening. Carts may be  either  rear-positioned  or  side-positioned.  All  of  the components  can be introduced stage-by-stage. This system  can  be  used  with  a  dental  chair,  but  it  is  most appropriate  for  use  with  the  custom  bench,  described below. In contemporary practices, the cart system is used in  conjunction  with  four-handed  dentistry.  A  dental assistant  is  required  to  pass  instruments  to  the  dentist. Most cart systems function without a cuspidor. Cuspidors may not be suitable for child patients-they can be used as a delaying tactic when the child constantly asks to sit up and rinse. In addition, a child may become upset when expectorating into the cuspidor and seeing blood. Advantages of the cart system include the fact that: the instruments are less visible to patients, it easily converts to left- or right-handed, it is the least expensive system, and there is open space above the patient, which may be needed  if  active  restraint  is  required  during  treatment. Disadvantages  include  the  fact  that:  cords  can  become tangled and operators or assistants can injure themselves by rubbing against sharp burs if the cart is improperly placed.  The  cart  system  is  more  prevalent  in  North America, but is less common in Europe.\nAnother  unique  feature  of  many  pediatric  dental treatment areas is the custom bench. Sometimes referred to as 'ironing boards,' they have replaced the conventional dental chair in many pediatric dentistry practices. The advantages of the custom bench are:\n- They are relatively inexpensive, compared to conventional dental chairs.\n- The dentist can lean on it, providing support and relieving pressure on the back.\n- There is no tipping back, like a dental chair, which can raise a child's anxiety level.\n- The operator can be in close proximity to the child patient.\nUnlike conventional dental chairs, custom benches can be designed to contain storage areas (Figure 17-17). They also can hold video sound wiring and contain nitrous oxide lines. Custom benches can also be made adjustable, allowing a patient to sit more upright. Box 17.1 describes the  construction  of  a  custom  bench.  Pediatric  dental benches are also available professionally manufactured (Figure 17-18). One advantage of the custom bench is the taper in the design, which makes it more ergonomically favorable. Another advantage is cost. Custom benches can usually be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of their commercial counterparts."

The  dentist  may  employ  the  distraction  technique  by telling  a  story  or  choose  to  use  external  distraction. External  distraction  is  independent  of  the  dentist  or staff. Traditionally, clinicians have employed two types of distractors: audio   systems with ear phones or video tapes (or television), the advantage of videotapes being that children are able to select their favorite programs.

In  offices  with  multiple  clinicians,  the  stool  can  be adjusted to compensate for height differences.\n- The width for the body is 21 inches.\n- From the bottom end, the width begins to taper at 49 inches.\n- The tapered portion is 27 inches.\n3-inch foam covers the plywood, with a vinyl outer covering  over  the  foam.  Most  benches  are  constructed  so that the top is parallel to the floor. However, some prefer the bench to tip downward slightly, about seven degrees.\nto those without video distraction. The merit of audio devices  for  distraction  was  explored  by  Aitken  et  al. (2000) with three groups of children between four and six years of age. The children had two visits each and heard relaxed or upbeat music or no music at all. While 90%  enjoyed  the  music, there was  no  significant difference in their behaviors. Prabhaar et al. (2007) compared audio and audiovisual distraction   techniques in managing pediatric dental patients. They studied sixty children, four to eight years of age, and   concluded that audiovisual distraction was a more effective procedure than audio distraction for managing the anxious pediatric dental patient.\nThe  effect  of  distraction  on  pain  threshold  has  also received  attention.  Studies  have  concluded  that  video distraction is ineffective in reducing pain during cavity preparation (Bentsen et al. 2001) or tooth scaling (Bentsen et al. 2003). Its practical use may lie in reducing general anxiety during less painful medical or dental procedures. Playing video clips during the inhaled induction of children undergoing ambulatory surgery was found to be an effective method of reducing anxiety (Mifflin et al. 2012).\nOne  difficulty  in  interpreting  the  results  of  these studies and comparing them to one another is that no two studies use the same software. A video or film that engages one group of children may have no attraction to  another  group.  Nonetheless,  the  studies  point  to  a beneficial  result  using  distractors,  and  they  should  be part of the behavior management armamentarium in a contemporary dental office.\nProper placement of video screens is important. With the child lying down and facing the ceiling, the monitor should be situated so that the child looks straight up-the line  of  vision  is  usually  ninety  degrees  to  the  ceiling (Figure 17-19). However, it can be more effective to place the monitor slightly farther back, so that the child actually has  to  tip  the  head  backward  slightly.  This  encourages opening the mouth. In addition,  a  child  with  a  nitrous oxide  nasal  mask  will  be  able  to  view  the  otherwise blocked monitor. Conversely, placing the monitor at the foot of the bench or chair is discouraged. The patient has to tip the head and chin downward to observe the video. One problem with placing the monitor in the ceiling is that it does not allow patient viewing while sitting up. A third position is approximately two feet to the dentist's side of the long axis of the patient chair and about seven feet above the floor (Unthank 2006). This position aligns with  the  patient's  mid-calf.  This  placement  is  ideally suited for patient viewing in a lying or sitting position.\nNot everyone likes to have monitors in the operatory. Some dentists limit them to recall examination chairs. They contend it interferes with eye-to-eye communication with the patient during restorative treatment, making the visit a continuous learning experience. Another consideration  is  that  many  children  have  their  own hand-held devices and prefer to entertain themselves. A child holding a device such as an iPod or smart phone may have less hand movement, resulting in less interference with the dental procedures (Figure 17-20).\n(a)\nFigure  17-19.

A child holding a device such as an iPod or smart phone may have less hand movement, resulting in less interference with the dental procedures.\nCareful office planning is required to enable the pediatric dentist to treat an array of behaviors in the treatment area. Therefore, most dentists using open bays will have a designated 'quiet' room or soundproof, closed operatory. The most common use of the quiet room is to serve as a treatment area for resistant patients; i.e., those who are  potentially  cooperative  or  who  lack  cooperative abilities,  and  who  might  create  a  disturbance  in  the office. Sedation is primarily the treatment for these children, and it is far better to treat them in the privacy of an isolation room. However, telling a parent that their child will  be  treated  in  the  'quiet  room'  rather  than  in  the open bay may cause a 'stigma.' To overcome this stigma, the  office  personnel  should  refer  to  this  multipurpose room  as  the  1)  Private  Operatory,  2)  Family  Suite,  3) Sedation Suite, or 4) Orthodontic Records Room.\nParents  also  can  become  quite  apprehensive  if  they are unaware of what is transpiring in the room. For this reason, a viewing area for parents is desirable. This can be accomplished with windowed or glass doors (Figure 17-21). They provide an opportunity for parents to  observe  their  children's  treatments,  and  they  may increase parents' tolerances for these techniques (Peretz and Zadik 1999). The glass also serves as a sound barrier."

    "context_enriched_content": "the office Décor\nMany dentists engage the services of a professional to assist with the decoration in an office. While they may create very tasteful finishing for the new office, they are not dental professionals. Get input from the members of the dental team, who contribute greatly to the success or failure of the office.\nWhile the walls do not need to be shockingly painted in bright blue or bold magenta, the office should consider colors that are warm and welcoming, like yellow or light blue.  Carpeting  is  also  an  issue.  For  hygienic  reasons, many offices  avoid  carpeting.  However,  if  considering carpeting,  many  carpets  can  be  flecked  with  different colors or include squares or dots of colors without being overwhelmingly  busy  or  too  bright.  Treatment  rooms may  be  color-coded  with  a  predominate  color-the patient,  dentist  and  dental  assistants'  chairs  match  the walls and/or doors (Figure 17-8). Patients are asked to go to the green or purple room. Children can easily recognize the room and feel more at ease.\nAfter the walls have been painted and the flooring is in place, thought has to be given to decorating the walls. Consider the ages of the patients in the practice. Many pediatric dentists err by decorating only for young children. Think of the older children, too. Colorful decorations, such as vintage posters or bright modern art, can be pleasing to both adults and children and can make the\nFigure 17-21. Sedation is conducted in this room.

Placing  a  stuffed  animal  in  a 'hiding' spot, such as in the corner of an exam office, can be fun for children to discover and can easily be removed when treating adults. Wall space may be created for the older age group. They are encouraged to bring in one of their school banners. They enjoy participating!\nPoster  decoration  is  an  important  part  of  the  office décor. Posters can be purchased from dental societies or associations.  However,  having  the  office  staff  design and create posters for the office is much more personal, and they are appreciated by children and parents. If possible, posters should be user-friendly and impart information such as why we take x-rays, or the need for urgent care following dental trauma.\nPatients differ. Dentists differ. And offices differ."
