This text is a presentation of how children grow, develop, and learn.\nWe will look at how we change physically over time from conception through adolescence. We examine cognitive change, or how our ability to think and remember, changes over the first 20 years or so of life. And we will look at how our emotions, psychological state, and social relationships change throughout childhood and adolescence. 1"

And early experiences affect later development.\n- Development is multidirectional. We show gains in some areas of development, while showing a loss in other areas.\n- Development is multidimensional. We change across three general domains/dimensions; physical, cognitive, and social and emotional.\n- o The physical domain includes changes in height and weight, changes in gross and fine motor skills, sensory capabilities, the nervous system, as well as the propensity for disease and illness.\n- o The cognitive domain encompasses the changes in intelligence, wisdom, perception, problem-solving, memory, and language.\n- o The social and emotional domain (also referred to as psychosocial) focuses on changes in emotion, self-perception, and interpersonal relationships with families, peers, and friends.\n1 Introduction to Lifespan, Growth and Development by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n5 | Child Growth and Development\n- The domains influence each other.\n- Development is characterized by plasticity, which is our ability to change and that many of our characteristics are malleable. Early experiences are important, but children are remarkably resilient (able to overcome adversity).\n- Development is multi contextual. 2 We are influenced by both nature (genetics) and nurture (the environment) - when and where we live and our actions, beliefs, and values are a response to circumstances surrounding us.  The key here is to understand that behaviors, motivations, emotions, and choices are all part of a bigger picture. 3"

Are features such as height, weight, personality, being diabetic, etc. the result of heredity or environmental factors-or both? For decades, scholars have carried on the \"nature/nurture\" debate. For any particular feature, those on the side of Nature would argue that heredity plays the most important role in bringing about that feature. Those on the side of Nurture would argue that one's environment is most significant in shaping the way we are. This debate continues in all aspects of human development, and most scholars agree that there is a constant interplay between the two forces. It is difficult to isolate the root of any single behavior as a result solely of nature or nurture.\n2 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 (modified by Jennifer Paris)\n3 Introduction to Lifespan, Growth and Development by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n6 | Child Growth and Development"

    "context_enriched_content": "Continuity versus Discontinuity\nIs human development best characterized as a slow, gradual process, or is it best viewed as one of more abrupt change? The answer to that question often depends on which developmental theorist you ask and what topic is being studied. The theories of Freud, Erikson, Piaget, and Kohlberg are called stage theories. Stage theories, or discontinuous development, assume that developmental change often occurs in distinct stages that are qualitatively different from each other, and in a set, universal sequence. At each stage of development, children and adults have different qualities and characteristics. Thus, stage theorists assume development is more discontinuous. Others, such as the behaviorists, Vygotsky, and information processing theorists, assume development is a more slow and gradual process known as continuous development. For instance, they would see the adult as not possessing new skills, but more advanced skills that were already present in some form in the child. Brain development and environmental experiences contribute to the acquisition of more developed skills.\nFigure 1.1 - The graph to the left shows three stages in the continuous growth of a tree. The graph to the right shows four distinct stages of development in the life cycle of a ladybug. 4"

One quantitative method of scientific investigation involves the following steps:\n1. Determining a research question\n2. Reviewing previous studies addressing the topic in question (known as a literature review)\n3. Determining a method of gathering information\n4. Conducting the study, collecting data\n5. Analyzing and interpreting results\n6. Drawing conclusions; stating limitations of the study and suggestions for future research\n7. Making your findings available to others (both to share information and to have your work scrutinized by others)\nThe findings can then be used by others as they explore the area of interest and through this process, a literature or knowledge base is established. This model of scientific investigation presents research as a linear process guided by a specific research question. And it typically involves quantifying or using statistics to understand and report what has been studied. Many academic journals publish reports on studies conducted in this manner.\nAnother model of research referred to as qualitative research may involve steps such as these:\n1. Begin with a broad area of interest\n2. Gain entrance into a group to be researched\n3. Gather field notes about the setting, the people, the structure, the activities or other areas of interest\n4. Ask open-ended, broad 'grand tour' types of questions when interviewing subjects\n5. Modify research questions as study continues\n6. Note patterns or consistencies\n7. Explore new areas deemed important by the people being observed\n8. Report findings\nIn this type of research, theoretical ideas are 'grounded' in the experiences of the participants. The researcher is the student and the people in the setting are the teachers as they inform the researcher of their world (Glazer & Strauss, 1967). Researchers are to be aware of their own biases and assumptions, acknowledge them, and bracket them in efforts to keep them from limiting accuracy in reporting. Sometimes qualitative studies are used initially to explore a topic and more quantitative studies are used to test or explain what was first described."

This may take place in the natural setting, such as observing children at play at a park, or behind a one-way glass while children are at play in a laboratory playroom, or in a classroom. The researcher may follow a checklist and record the frequency and duration of events (perhaps how many conflicts occur among 2-year-olds) or may observe and record as much as possible about an event (such as observing children in a classroom and capturing the details about the room design and what the children and teachers are doing and saying). In general, observational studies have the strength of allowing the researcher to see how people behave rather than relying on selfreport. What people do and what they say they do are often very different. A major weakness of observational studies is that they do not allow the researcher to explain causal relationships. Yet, observational studies are useful and widely used when studying children. Children tend to change their behavior when they know they are being watched (known as the Hawthorne effect) and may not survey well."

    "context_enriched_content": "Experiments\nExperiments are designed to test hypotheses (or specific statements about the relationship between variables) in a controlled setting in efforts to explain how certain factors or events produce outcomes. A variable is anything that changes in value. Concepts are operationalized or transformed into variables in research, which means that the researcher must specify exactly what is going to be measured in the study.\nThree conditions must be met in order to establish cause and effect. Experimental designs are useful in meeting these conditions.\n1. The independent and dependent variables must be related. In other words, when one is altered, the other changes in response. (For example, if we are looking at the impact of exercise on stress levels, the independent variable would be exercise; the dependent variable would be stress.)\n2. The cause must come before the effect. Experiments involve measuring subjects on the dependent variable before exposing them to the independent variable (establishing a baseline). So we would measure the subjects' level of stress before introducing exercise and then again after the exercise to see if there has been a change in stress levels.\n3. The cause must be isolated. The researcher must ensure that no outside, perhaps unknown variables are actually causing the effect we see. The experimental design helps make this possible. In an experiment, we would make sure that our subjects' diets were held constant throughout the exercise program. Otherwise, diet might really be creating the change in stress level rather than exercise.\nA basic experimental design involves beginning with a sample (or subset of a population) and randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups: the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group is the group that is going to be exposed to an independent variable or condition the researcher is introducing as a potential cause of an event. The control group is going to be used for comparison and is going to have the same experience as the experimental group but will not be exposed to the independent variable. After exposing the experimental group to the independent variable, the two groups are measured again to see if a change has occurred. If so, we are in a better position to suggest that the independent variable caused the change in the dependent variable.\nThe major advantage of the experimental design is that of helping to establish cause and effect relationships. A disadvantage of this design is the difficulty of translating much of what happens in a laboratory setting into real life."

And they are often used by clinicians who conduct case studies as part of their normal practice when gathering information about a client or patient coming in for treatment. Case studies can be used to explore areas about which little is known and can provide rich detail about situations or conditions. However, the findings from case studies cannot be generalized or applied to larger populations; this is because cases are not randomly selected and no control group is used for comparison.\nFigure 1.2 - Illustrated poster from a classroom describing a case study. 6\n6 Image by MaryGeorge is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0"

His assumptions that personality forms during the first few years of life and that the ways in which parents or other caregivers interact with children have a longlasting impact on children's emotional states have guided parents, educators, clinicians, and policy-makers for many years. We have only recently begun to recognize that early childhood\nQualitative Studies by Lisa J.

There is a growing body of literature addressing resilience in children who come from harsh backgrounds and yet develop without damaging emotional scars (O'Grady and Metz, 1987). Freud has stimulated an enormous amount of research and generated many ideas. Agreeing with Freud's theory in its entirety is hardly necessary for appreciating the contribution he has made to the field of development.\nFigure 1.6 - Sigmund Freud. 15\nFreud's theory of self suggests that there are three parts of the self.\nThe id is the part of the self that is inborn. It responds to biological urges without pause and is guided by the principle of pleasure: if it feels good, it is the thing to do. A newborn is all id. The newborn cries when hungry, defecates when the urge strikes.\nThe ego develops through interaction with others and is guided by logic or the reality principle. It has the ability to delay gratification. It knows that urges have to be managed. It mediates between the id and superego using logic and reality to calm the other parts of the self. The superego represents society's demands for its members. It is guided by a sense of guilt. Values, morals, and conscience are all part of the superego.\nThe personality is thought to develop in response to the child's ability to learn to manage biological urges. Parenting is important here. If the parent is either overly punitive or lax, the child may not progress to the next stage. Here is a brief introduction to Freud's stages.\n15 Image is in the public domain\nTable 1.2 - Sigmund Freud's Psychosexual Theory\n\nOral Stage, Descriptions of Stage = The oral stage lasts from birth until around age 2. The infant is all id. At this stage, all stimulation and comfort is focused on the mouth and is based on the reflex of sucking. Too much indulgence or too little stimulation may lead to fixation.. Anal Stage, Descriptions of Stage = The anal stage coincides with potty training or learning to manage biological urges. The ego is beginning to develop in this stage. Anal fixation may result in a person who is compulsively clean and organized or one who is sloppy and lacks self-control.. Phallic Stage, Descriptions of Stage = The phallic stage occurs in early childhood and marks the development of the superego and a sense of masculinity or femininity as culture dictates.. Latency, Descriptions of Stage = Latency occurs during middle childhood when a child's urges quiet down and friendships become the focus. The ego and superego can be refined as the child learns how to cooperate and negotiate with others.. Genital Stage, Descriptions of Stage = The genital stage begins with puberty and continues through adulthood. Now the preoccupation is that of sex and reproduction."

How can parenting in infancy be traced to personality in adulthood? Are there other variables that might better explain development? The theory is also considered to be sexist in suggesting that women who do not accept an inferior position in society are somehow psychologically flawed. Freud focuses on the darker side of human nature and suggests that much of what determines our actions is unknown to us. So why do we study Freud? As mentioned above, despite the criticisms, Freud's assumptions about the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping our psychological selves have found their way into child development, education, and parenting practices. Freud's theory has heuristic value in providing a framework from which to elaborate and modify subsequent theories of development.

In his theory of psychosocial development, Erikson suggested that our relationships and society's expectations motivate much of our behavior. Erikson agreed with some of Freud's work, but emphasized the importance of the ego, or conscious thought, in determining our actions. In other words, he believed that we are not driven by unconscious urges. As humans, we have the ability to know what motivates us and we consciously think about how to achieve our goals.\nFigure 1.7 - Erik Erikson. 17\nErikson expanded on Freud's theory by emphasizing the importance of culture in parenting practices and motivations and adding three stages of adult development (Erikson, 1950; 1968). He believed that we are aware of what motivates us throughout life and the ego has greater importance in guiding our actions than does the id. We make conscious choices in life and these choices focus on meeting certain social and cultural needs rather than purely biological ones. Humans are motivated, for instance, by the need to feel that the world is a trustworthy place, that we are capable individuals, that we can make a contribution to society, and that we have lived a meaningful life. These are all psychosocial problems.\n17 Image is in the public domain\nErikson divided the lifespan into eight stages. In each stage, we have a major psychosocial task to accomplish or crisis to overcome.  Erikson believed that our personality continues to take shape throughout our lifespan as we face these challenges in living.  Here is a brief overview of the eight stages:\nTable 1.3 - Erik Erikson's Psychosocial Theory\n\nTrust vs. mistrust (0-1), Description of Stage = The infant must have basic needs met in a consistent way in order to feel that the world is a trustworthy place.. Autonomy vs. shame and doubt (1-2), Description of Stage = Mobile toddlers have newfound freedom they like to exercise and by being allowed to do so, they learn some basic independence.. Initiative vs. Guilt (3-5), Description of Stage = Preschoolers like to initiate activities and emphasize doing things 'all by myself.'. Industry vs. inferiority (6- 11), Description of Stage = School-aged children focus on accomplishments and begin making comparisons between themselves and their classmates. Identity vs. role confusion (adolescence), Description of Stage = Teenagers are trying to gain a sense of identity as they experiment with various roles, beliefs, and ideas.. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood), Description of Stage = In our 20s and 30s, we are making some of our first long-term commitments in intimate relationships.. Generativity vs. stagnation (middle adulthood), Description of Stage = In the 40s through the early 60s, we focus on being productive at work and home and are motivated by wanting to feel that we've made a contribution to society.. Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood), Description of Stage = Welook back on our lives and hope to like what we see - that we have lived well and have a sense of integrity because we lived according to our beliefs.\nThese eight stages form a foundation for discussions on emotional and social development during the life span. Keep in mind, however, that these stages or crises can occur more than once. For instance, a person may struggle with a lack of trust beyond infancy under certain circumstances. Erikson's theory has been criticized for focusing so heavily on stages and assuming that the completion of one stage is a prerequisite for the next crisis of development. His theory also focuses on the social expectations that are found in certain cultures, but not in\nall. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate well in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the transition into adulthood coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles offer fewer choices. 18"

As he recorded the amount of salivation his laboratory dogs produced as they ate, he noticed that they actually began to salivate before the food arrived as the researcher walked down the hall and toward the cage. 'This,' he thought, 'is not natural!' One would expect a dog to automatically salivate when the food hits their palate, but BEFORE the food comes? Of course, what had happened was . . . you tell me. That's right! The dogs knew that the food was coming because they had learned to associate the footsteps with the food. The keyword here is 'learned'. A learned response is called a 'conditioned' response.\nFigure 1.8 - Ivan Pavlov. 20\n18 Psychosocial Theory by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n19 History of Psychology by David B. Baker and Heather Sperry is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n20 Image is in the public domain\nPavlov began to experiment with this concept of classical conditioning . He began to ring a bell, for instance, prior to introducing the food. Sure enough, after making this connection several times, the dogs could be made to salivate to the sound of a bell. Once the bell had become an event to which the dogs had learned to salivate, it was called a conditioned stimulus . The act of salivating to a bell was a response that had also been learned, now termed in Pavlov's jargon, a conditioned response. Notice that the response, salivation, is the same whether it is conditioned or unconditioned (unlearned or natural). What changed is the stimulus to which the dog salivates. One is natural (unconditioned) and one is learned (conditioned).\nHow classical conditioning is used on humans? One of the most widespread applications of classical conditioning principles was brought to us by the psychologist, John B. Watson."

Watson. 21\nHe tried to demonstrate the power of classical conditioning with his famous experiment with an 18-month-old boy named 'Little Albert'. Watson sat Albert down and introduced a variety of seemingly scary objects to him: a burning piece of newspaper, a white rat, etc. But Albert remained curious and reached for all of these things. Watson knew that one of our only inborn fears is the fear of loud noises so he proceeded to make a loud noise each time he introduced one of Albert's favorites, a white rat. After hearing the loud noise several times paired with the rat, Albert soon came to fear the rat and began to cry when it was introduced. Watson filmed this experiment for posterity and used it to demonstrate that he could help parents achieve any outcomes they desired if they would only follow his advice. Watson wrote columns in newspapers and magazines and gained a lot of popularity among parents eager to apply science to household order.\nOperant conditioning, on the other hand, looks at the way the consequences of a behavior increase or decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring again.\n21 Image is in the public domain"

Skinner (1904-1990), who brought us the principles of operant conditioning, suggested that reinforcement is a more effective means of encouraging a behavior than is criticism or punishment. By focusing on strengthening desirable behavior, we have a greater impact than if we emphasize what is undesirable. Reinforcement is anything that an organism desires and is motivated to obtain.\nFigure 1.10 - B. F. Skinner. 22\nA reinforcer is something that encourages or promotes a behavior. Some things are natural rewards. They are considered intrinsic or primary because their value is easily understood. Think of what kinds of things babies or animals such as puppies find rewarding.\nExtrinsic or secondary reinforcers are things that have a value not immediately understood. Their value is indirect. They can be traded in for what is ultimately desired.\nThe use of positive reinforcement involves adding something to a situation in order to encourage a behavior. For example, if I give a child a cookie for cleaning a room, the addition of the cookie makes cleaning more likely in the future. Think of ways in which you positively reinforce others.\nNegative reinforcement occurs when taking something unpleasant away from a situation encourages behavior. For example, I have an alarm clock that makes a very unpleasant, loud sound when it goes off in the morning. As a result, I get up and turn it off. By removing the noise, I am reinforced for getting up. How do you negatively reinforce others?\nPunishment is an effort to stop a behavior. It means to follow an action with something unpleasant or painful. Punishment is often less effective than reinforcement for several reasons. It doesn't indicate the desired behavior, it may result in suppressing rather than stopping a behavior, (in other words, the person may not do what is being punished when you're around, but may do it often when you leave), and a focus on punishment can result in not noticing when the person does well.\nNot all behaviors are learned through association or reinforcement. Many of the things we do are learned by watching others. This is addressed in social learning theory.\n22 Image is in the public domain"

He calls attention to the ways in which many of our actions are not learned through conditioning; rather, they are learned by watching others (1977). Young children frequently learn behaviors through imitation\nFigure 1.11 - Albert Bandura. 23\nSometimes, particularly when we do not know what else to do, we learn by modeling or copying the behavior of others. A kindergartner on his or her first day of school might eagerly look at how others are acting and try to act the same way to fit in more quickly. Adolescents struggling with their identity rely heavily on their peers to act as role-models. Sometimes we do things because we've seen it pay off for someone else. They were operantly conditioned, but we engage in the behavior because we hope it will pay off for us as well. This is referred to as vicarious reinforcement (Bandura, Ross, and Ross, 1963).\nBandura (1986) suggests that there is an interplay between the environment and the individual. We are not just the product of our surroundings, rather we influence our surroundings. Parents not only influence their child's environment, perhaps intentionally through the use of reinforcement, etc., but children influence parents as well. Parents may respond differently with their first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they try to be the perfect parents with their firstborn, but by the time their last child comes along they have very different expectations both of themselves and their child. Our environment creates us and we create our environment. 24\n23 Image by Albert Bandura is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n24 Exploring Behavior by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0; Lecture Transcript: Developmental Theories\nby Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0"

(1963) began a series of studies to look at the impact of television, particularly commercials, on the behavior of children.  Are children more likely to act out aggressively when they see this behavior modeled? What if they see it being reinforced? Bandura began by conducting an experiment in which he showed children a film of a woman hitting an inflatable clown or 'bobo' doll. Then the children were allowed in the room where they found the doll and immediately began to hit it. This was without any reinforcement whatsoever. Not only that, but they found new ways to behave aggressively. It's as if they learned an aggressive role.\nChildren view far more television today than in the 1960s; so much, in fact, that they have been referred to as Generation M (media). The amount of screen time varies by age. As of 2017, children 0-8 spend an average of 2 hours and 19 minutes. Children 8-12 years of age spend almost 6 hours a day on screen media. And 13- to 18-year-olds spend an average of just under 9 hours a day in entertainment media use. The prevalence of violence, sexual content, and messages promoting foods high in fat and sugar in the media are certainly cause for concern and the subjects of ongoing research and policy review. Many children spend even more time on the computer viewing content from the internet. The amount of time spent connected to the internet continues to increase with the use of smartphones that essentially serve as mini-computers. And the ways children and adolescents interact with the media continues to change. The popularity of YouTube and the various social media platforms are examples of this.

    "context_enriched_content": "Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development\nJean Piaget (1896-1980) is one of the most influential cognitive theorists. Piaget was inspired to explore children's ability to think and reason by watching his own children's development. He was one of the first to recognize and map out the ways in which children's thought differs from that of adults. His interest in this area began when he was asked to test the IQ of children and began to notice that there was a pattern in their wrong answers. He believed that children's intellectual skills change over time through maturation. Children of differing ages interpret the world differently.\nFigure 1.12 - Jean Piaget. 25\nPiaget believed our desire to understand the world comes from a need for cognitive equilibrium . This is an agreement or balance between what we sense in the outside world and what we know in our minds. If we experience something that we cannot understand, we try to restore the balance by either changing our thoughts or by altering the experience to fit into what we do understand. Perhaps you meet someone who is very different from anyone you know. How do you make sense of this person? You might use them to establish a new category of people in your mind or you might think about how they are similar to someone else.\nA schema or schemes are categories of knowledge. They are like mental boxes of concepts. A child has to learn many concepts. They may have a scheme for 'under' and 'soft' or 'running' and 'sour'. All of these are schema. Our efforts to understand the world around us lead us to develop new schema and to modify old ones.\nOne way to make sense of new experiences is to focus on how they are similar to what we already know. This is assimilation . So, the person we meet who is very different may be understood as being 'sort of like my brother' or 'his voice sounds a lot like yours.' Or a new food may be assimilated when we determine that it tastes like chicken!\nAnother way to make sense of the world is to change our mind. We can make a cognitive accommodation to this new experience by adding new schema. This food is unlike anything I've tasted before. I now have a new category of foods that are bitter-sweet in flavor, for instance. This is accommodation . Do you accommodate or assimilate more frequently? Children\n25 Image is in the public domain\naccommodate more frequently as they build new schema. Adults tend to look for similarity in their experience and assimilate. They may be less inclined to think 'outside the box.' Piaget suggested different ways of understanding that are associated with maturation. He divided this into four stages:\nTable 1.4 - Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development\n\nSensorimotor Stage, Description of Stage = During the s ensorimotor stage, children rely on use of the senses and motor skills. From birth until about age 2, the infant knows by tasting, smelling, touching, hearing, and moving objects around. This is a real hands-on type of knowledge.. Preoperational Stage, Description of Stage = In the preoperational stage , children from ages 2 to 7, become able to think about the world using symbols. A symbol is something that stands for something else. The use of language, whether it is in the form of words or gestures, facilitates knowing and communicating about the world. This is the hallmark of preoperational intelligence and occurs in early childhood. However, these children are preoperational or pre- logical. They still do not understand how the physical world operates. They may, for instance, fear that they will go down the drain if they sit at the front of the bathtub, even though they are too big.. Concrete Operational, Description of Stage = Children in the concrete operational stage, ages 7 to 11, develop the ability to think logically about the physical world. Middle childhood is a time of understanding concepts such as size, distance, and constancy of matter, and cause and effect relationships. A child knows that a scrambled egg is still an egg and that 8 ounces of water is still 8 ounces no matter what shape of glass contains it.. Formal Operational, Description of Stage = During the formal operational stage children, at about age 12, acquire the ability to think logically about concrete and abstract events. The teenager who has reached this stage is able to consider possibilities and to contemplate ideas about situations that have never been directly encountered. More abstract understanding of religious ideas or morals or ethics and abstract principles such as freedom and dignity can be considered."

Vygotsky differed with Piaget in that he believed that a person not only has a set of abilities, but also a set of potential abilities that can be realized if given the proper guidance from others. His sociocultural theory emphasizes the importance of culture and interaction in the development of cognitive abilities. He believed that through guided participation known as scaffolding, with a teacher or capable peer, a child can learn cognitive skills within a certain range known as the zone of proximal development . 27 He believed that development occurred first through children's immediate social interactions, and then moved to the individual level as they began to internalize their learning. 28\n26 Lecture Transcript: Developmental Theories by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0 (modified by Jennifer Paris)\nExploring Cognition by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n27 Exploring Cognition by Lumen Learning is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n28 Children's Development by Ana R.

You gave them assistance when they seemed to need it, but once they knew what to do-you stood back and let them go. This is scaffolding and can be seen demonstrated throughout the world. This approach to teaching has also been adopted by educators. Rather than assessing students on what they are doing, they should be understood in terms of what they are capable of doing with the proper guidance.

What is being taught and how society interprets situations depends on who is involved in the life of a child and on when and where a child lives.\nFigure 1.14 - Urie Bronfenbrenner. 32\nBronfenbrenner's ecological systems model explains the direct and indirect influences on an individual's development.\nTable 1.5 - Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Model\n\nMicrosystems, Description of System = Microsystems impact a child directly. These are the people with whom the child interacts such as parents, peers, and teachers. The relationship between individuals and those around them need to be considered. For example, to appreciate what is going on with a student in math, the relationship between the student and teacher should be known..

We have to look at the interactions that occur between teacher and child. Perhaps the teacher needs to make modifications as well. The teacher may be responding to regulations made by the school, such as new expectations for students in math or constraints on time that interfere with the teacher's ability to instruct. These new demands may be a response to national efforts to promote math and science deemed important by political leaders in response to relations with other countries at a particular time in history.\nFigure 1.15 - Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. 33\nBronfenbrenner's ecological systems model challenges us to go beyond the individual if we want to understand human development and promote improvements. 34\n33 Image by Ian Joslin is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n34 Children's Development by Ana R.

Women are born with all of the egg cells they will ever have. In contrast, once men reach puberty, they continually produce millions of sperm daily (however it takes about 23 months for the sperm to mature and be ready for ejaculation). About every 28 days, a mature woman ovulates and releases one ovum. The ovum travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. If it is met by a sperm cell while in the fallopian tube, then fertilization can take place. The newly fertilized egg, called a zygote, starts to duplicate into a bundle of cells as it then continues to travel down the fallopian tube to implant into the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized by a sperm cell then it will pass through the uterus and be expelled during the woman's next menstrual period."

These options are available for people who are experiencing infertility or cannot conceive children naturally (which also includes single parents, and gay/lesbian couples). 35\nIntrauterine insemination : (IUI) as a type of artificial insemination involves the placement of sperm directly into the uterus at the time of ovulation, either in a natural menstrual cycle or following ovarian stimulation. 36\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) : IVF generally starts with stimulating the ovaries to increase egg production. Most fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone. After stimulation, the physician surgically extracts one or more eggs from the ovary, and unites them with sperm in a laboratory setting, with the intent of producing one or more embryos. Fertilization takes place outside the body, and the fertilized egg is reinserted into the woman's reproductive tract, in a procedure called embryo transfer. 37\nFigure 2.1 - The IVF process. 38\nDonor Gametes & Embryos : People can also use sperm, ova (eggs), and embryos from donors in conjunction with ART.

It is difficult to isolate the root of any single characteristic as a result solely of nature or nurture, and most scholars believe that even determining the extent to which nature or nurture impacts a human feature is difficult to answer. In fact, almost all human features are polygenic (a result of many genes) and multifactorial (a result of many factors, both genetic and environmental). It's as if one's genetic make-up sets up a range of possibilities, which may or may not be realized depending upon one's environmental experiences. For instance, a person might be genetically predisposed to develop diabetes, but the person's lifestyle may determine whether or not they actually develop the disease.\n39 Surrogacy by Fertilitypedia is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n40 Photo by Daryn Crawford used with permission\n41 Photo by Michaela Szidloski used with permission\nFigure 2.3 - This single mother adopted her daughter.\nThis bidirectional interplay between nature and nurture is the epigenetic framework , which suggests that the environment can affect the expression of genes just as genetic predispositions can impact a person's potentials.

Genes are recipes for making proteins, while proteins influence the structure and functions of cells. Genes are located on the chromosomes and there are an estimated 20,500 genes for humans, according to the Human Genome Project (NIH, 2015).\nFigure 2.4 - DNA's location in the cell. 43\nNormal human cells contain 46 chromosomes (or 23 pairs; one from each parent) in the nucleus of the cells. After conception, most cells of the body are created by a process called mitosis. Mitosis is defined as the cell's nucleus making an exact copy of all the chromosomes and splitting into two new cells.\nHowever, the cells used in sexual reproduction, called the gametes (sperm or ova), are formed in a process called meiosis . In meiosis, the gamete's chromosomes duplicate and then divide twice resulting in four cells containing only half the genetic material of the original gamete. Thus, each sperm and egg possess only 23 chromosomes and combine to produce 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total).\nOf the 23 pairs of chromosomes created at conception, 22 pairs are similar in length. These are called autosomes . The remaining pair, or sex chromosomes , may differ in length. If a child\n42 Lifespan Development - Module 3: Prenatal Development by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n43 Image by Radio89 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 (original image has been modified)\nreceives the combination of XY, the child will be genetically male.

The word phenotype refers to the features that are actually expressed. Look in the mirror. What do you see, your genotype, or your phenotype? What determines whether or not genes are expressed? Because genes are inherited in pairs on the chromosomes, we may receive either the same version of a gene from our mother and father, that is, be homozygous for that characteristic the gene influences. If we receive a different version of the gene from each parent, that is referred to as heterozygous .\nIn the homozygous situation, we will display that characteristic. It is in the heterozygous condition that it becomes clear that not all genes are created equal. Some genes are dominant , meaning they express themselves in the phenotype even when paired with a different version of the gene, while their silent partner is called recessive. Recessive genes express themselves only when paired with a similar version gene. Geneticists refer to different versions of a gene as alleles. Some dominant traits include having facial dimples, curly hair, normal vision, and dark hair. Some recessive traits include blonde hair, being nearsighted, and straight hair.\nMost characteristics are not the result of a single gene; they are polygenic , meaning they are the result of several genes.\n44 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 34-35) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French\nis licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n45 Image by Nami-ja is in the public domain"

For example, the majority of those with Tourette's Syndrome suffer only minor tics from time to time and can easily control their symptoms. When dominant-gene linked diseases are serious, they do not tend to become symptomatic until later in life. Huntington's Disease is a dominant gene linked disorder that affects the nervous system and is fatal, but does not appear until midlife.\nRecessive gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia, are less common but may actually claim more lives because they are less likely to be detected as people are unaware that they are carriers of the disease.\nSome genetic disorders are sex-linked; the defective gene is found on the X-chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome so are at greater risk for sex-linked disorders. Examples of some of these disorders are hemophilia, color-blindness, and baldness. For females to be affected by recessive genetic defects, they need to inherit the recessive gene on both Xchromosomes. But if the defective gene is dominant, females are equally at risk.\nHere are tables of some genetic disorders:\nAutosomal Dominant Disorders (Heterozygous) : In order to have the disorder, the individual only needs to inherit the gene change from one parent.\nTable 2.1 - Autosomal Dominant Disorders (Heterozygous) 46\n\nHuntington's Disease, Description = A condition that affects the individual's nervous system.

The most common cause of chromosomal abnormalities is the age of the mother. As the mother ages, the ovum is more likely to suffer abnormalities due to longer-term exposure to environmental factors. Consequently, some gametes do not divide evenly when they are forming. Therefore, some cells have more than 46 chromosomes. In fact, it is believed that close to half of all zygotes have an odd number of chromosomes. Most of these zygotes fail to develop and are spontaneously aborted by the mother's body. 49\nHere is a table of some autosomal chromosomal disorders:\nAutosomal Chromosome Disorders : The individual inherits too many or too few chromosomes.\n48 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (pages 36-37) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n49 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 38) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nTable 2.4 - Autosomal Chromosomal Disorders 50\n\nDown Syndrome/Trisomy 21, Description = Caused by an extra chromosome 21 and includes a combination of birth defects.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Germinal Period\nThe germinal period (about 14 days in length) lasts from conception to implantation of the fertilized egg in the lining of the uterus. At ejaculation, millions of sperm are released into the vagina, but a few reach the egg and only one fertilizes the egg. Once a single sperm has entered the wall of the egg, the wall becomes hard and prevents other sperm from entering. After the sperm has entered the egg, the tail of the sperm breaks off and the head of the sperm, containing the genetic information from the father, unites with the nucleus of the egg. It is typically fertilized in the top section of the fallopian tube and continues its journey to the uterus. As a result, a new cell is formed. This cell, containing the combined genetic information from both parents, is referred to as a zygote .\nFigure 3.1 - Sperm and ovum at conception. 55\nDuring this time, the organism begins cell division through mitosis. After five days of mitosis, there are 100 cells, which is now called a blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of both an inner and an outer group of cells. The inner group of cells, or embryonic disk will become the embryo, while the outer group of cells, or trophoblast, becomes the support system which nourishes the developing organism. This stage ends when the blastocyst fully implants into the uterine wall (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015).\n55 Image is in the public domain\nFigure 3.2 - The cycle of fertilization. 56\nMitosis is a fragile process and fewer than one-half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004). Some of the reasons for this include: the egg and sperm do not join properly, thus their genetic material does not combine, there is too little or damaged genetic material, the zygote does not replicate, or the blastocyst does not implant into the uterine wall. The failure rate is higher for in vitro conceptions. The figure above illustrates the journey of the ova from its release to its fertilization, cell duplication, and implantation into the uterine lining. 57"

Now blood vessels grow forming the placenta. The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord.\nDuring this period, cells continue to differentiate . Growth during prenatal development occurs in two major directions: from head to tail called cephalocaudal development and from the midline outward referred to as proximodistal development . This means that those structures nearest the head develop before those nearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso\n56 Image by Ttrue12 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n57 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (pages 42-43) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\ndevelop before those away from the center of the body (such as hands and fingers). You will see that this pattern continues after birth.\nThe head develops in the fourth week and the precursor to the heart begins to pulse. In the early stages of the embryonic period, gills and a tail are apparent. However, by the end of this stage, they disappear and the organism takes on a more human appearance.\nFigure 3.3 - A human embryo. 58\nAbout 20 percent of organisms do not survive past the embryonic period, usually due to gross chromosomal abnormalities, often before the mother even knows that she is pregnant. It is during this stage that the major structures of the body are taking form, making the embryonic period the time when the organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage if exposed to harmful substances. Prospective mothers are not often aware of the risks they introduce to the developing embryo during this time. The embryo is approximately 1 inch in length and weighs about 4 grams at the end of eight weeks. The embryo can move and respond to touch at this time. 59"

During this stage, the major structures are continuing to develop. By the third month, the fetus has all its body parts including external genitalia. The fetus is about 3 inches long and weighs about 28 grams. In the following weeks, the fetus will develop hair, nails, teeth and the excretory and digestive systems will continue to develop.\n58 Image by Anatomist90 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n59 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 43) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nFigure 3.4 - A human fetus. 60\nDuring the 4th - 6th months, the eyes become more sensitive to light and hearing develops. The respiratory system continues to develop, and reflexes such as sucking, swallowing and hiccupping, develop during the 5th month. Cycles of sleep and wakefulness are present at this time as well. The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the age of viability is reached at about 24 weeks (Morgan, Goldenberg, & Schulkin, 2008). Many practitioners hesitate to resuscitate before 24 weeks. The majority of the neurons in the brain have developed by 24 weeks, although they are still rudimentary, and the glial cells that support neurons continue to grow. At 24 weeks the fetus can feel pain (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1997).\nBetween the 7th - 9th months, the fetus is primarily preparing for birth. It is exercising its muscles and its lungs begin to expand and contract. The fetus gains about 5 pounds and 7 inches during this last trimester of pregnancy, and during the 8th month, a layer of fat develops under the skin. This layer of fat serves as insulation and helps the baby regulate body temperature after birth.\nAt around 36 weeks the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long. By week 37 all of the fetus's organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the mother's uterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks. By then the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent. The progression through the stages is shown in the following figure. 61\n60 Image by lunar caustic is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n61 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (pages 44-45) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n|\n9 weeks Fetal stage begins\n20 weeks Hearing begins\n32 weeks Bones fully develop\n16 weeks Fingers and toes develop\n28 weeks Brain grows rapidly\n12 weeks Sex organs differentiate\n24 weeks Lungs begin to develop\n36 weeks Muscles fully develop\n40 weeks Full-term development\nFigure 3.5 - The development of a fetus. 62"

    "context_enriched_content": "Teratogens\nGood prenatal care is essential to protect against maternal and fetal/infant mortality and birth complications. The embryo and fetus are most at risk for some of the most severe problems during the first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time at which many mothers are unaware that they are pregnant. Today, we know many of the factors that can jeopardize the health of the developing child. The study of factors that contribute to birth defects is called teratology. Teratogens are environmental factors that can contribute to birth defects, and include some maternal diseases, pollutants, drugs, and alcohol.\nFactors influencing prenatal risks: There are several considerations in determining the type and amount of damage that might result from exposure to a particular teratogen (Berger, 2005). These include:\n- The timing of the exposure: Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe damage when they are forming. If a substance is introduced during a particular structure's critical period (time of development), the damage to that structure may be greater. For example, the ears and arms reach their critical periods at about 6 weeks after conception. If a mother exposes the embryo to certain substances during this period, the arms and ears may be malformed. (see figure below)\n63 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 36) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n64 Image is in the public domain\n65 Image by Jennifer Paris used with permission\n- The amount of exposure: Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a certain level. The critical level depends in part on the size and metabolism of the mother.\n- The number of teratogens: Fetuses exposed to multiple teratogens typically have more problems than those exposed to only one.\n- Genetics: Genetic makeup also plays a role in the impact a particular teratogen might have on the child. This is suggested by fraternal twins exposed to the same prenatal environment, but they do not experience the same teratogenic effects. The genetic makeup of the mother can also have an effect; some mothers may be more resistant to teratogenic effects than others.\n- Being male or female: Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens than are females. It is believed that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes than the X, may have an impact. 66\nFigure 3.8 - The development of an embryo into a fetus. 67\nThere are four categories of teratogens:\n1. Physical teratogens: These could be saunas, hot tubs, or infections that raise a pregnant woman's body temperature to 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. This is associated with neural tube defects, spontaneous abortions, and various cardiovascular abnormalities.\n2. Metabolic conditions affecting pregnant females : Metabolic conditions are abnormalities in the chemical process of producing energy from food, and thereby affect the development and function of the body. If a pregnant woman is malnourished,\n66 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (pages 46-47) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n67 Image by Laura Overstreet is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n- then her fetus likely lacks the nutrients essential for its development. These include: malnutrition, diabetes, and thyroid disorders.\n3. Infections : Different maternal infections, including rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, and syphilis can cause congenital abnormalities in fetuses.\n4. Drugs and chemicals : When pregnant females ingest or absorb these, they may cause a variety of different effects based on the specific agent, amount of exposure, and timing. This category includes radiation, heavy metals (including lead), insecticides and herbicides, prescription and over the counter drugs, illicit and recreational drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, nicotine, caffeine, and even some vitamins. 68\nWhile there are many, many potential teratogens, the following tables look at the effects of some different types of teratogens. The risks of exposure vary based on lifestyle and health. The effects may vary greatly depending on the factors mentioned previously."

However, according to the March of Dimes (2016d), women over age 35 are more likely to have an increased risk of:\n- Fertility problems\n- High blood pressure\n- Diabetes\n- Miscarriages\n- Placenta Previa\n- Cesarean section\n- Premature birth\n- Stillbirth\n- A baby with a genetic disorder or other birth defects\nBecause a woman is born with all her eggs, environmental teratogens can affect the quality of the eggs as women get older. Also, a woman's reproductive system ages which can adversely affect the pregnancy. Some women over 35 choose special prenatal screening tests, such as a maternal blood screening, to determine if there are any health risks for the baby.\nAlthough there are medical concerns associated with having a child later in life, there are also many positive consequences to being a more mature parent. Older parents are more confident, less stressed, and typically married, providing family stability. Their children perform better on math and reading tests, and they are less prone to injuries or emotional troubles (Albert, 2013). Women who choose to wait are often well educated and lead healthy lives. According to Gregory (2007), older women are more stable, demonstrate a stronger family focus, possess greater self-confidence, and have more money. Having a child later in one's career equals overall higher wages. In fact, for every year a woman delays motherhood, she makes 9% more in lifetime earnings. Lastly, women who delay having children actually live longer."

Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the mother gives birth, but it might indicate a risk for developing diabetes later in life. If untreated, gestational diabetes can cause premature birth, stillbirth, the baby having breathing problems at birth, jaundice, or low blood sugar. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can also be considerably heavier (more than 9 pounds) making the labor and birth process more difficult. For expectant mothers, untreated gestational diabetes can cause preeclampsia (high blood pressure and signs that the liver and kidneys may not be working properly) discussed later in the chapter.\nRisk factors for gestational diabetes include age (being over age 25), being overweight or gaining too much weight during pregnancy, family history of diabetes, having had gestational diabetes with a prior pregnancy, and race and ethnicity (African-American, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander have a higher risk). Eating healthy and maintaining a healthy weight during pregnancy can reduce the chance of gestational diabetes. Women who already have diabetes and become pregnant need to attend all their prenatal care visits, and follow the same advice as those for women with gestational diabetes as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, birth defects, and stillbirth are the same.\n89 Image by Jessica Merz is licensed under CC BY 2.0"

Some people are Rh negative, meaning this protein is absent. Mothers who are Rh negative are at risk of having a baby with a form of anemia called Rh disease (March of Dimes, 2009).\nA father who is Rh-positive and a mother who is Rh-negative can conceive a baby who is Rhpositive. Some of the fetus's blood cells may get into the mother's bloodstream and her immune system is unable to recognize the Rh factor. The immune system starts to produce antibodies to fight off what it thinks is a foreign invader. Once her body produces immunity, the antibodies can cross the placenta and start to destroy the red blood cells of the developing fetus. As this process takes time, often the first Rh positive baby is not harmed, but as the mother's body will continue to produce antibodies to the Rh factor across her lifetime, subsequent pregnancies can pose a greater risk for an Rh positive baby. In a newborn, Rh disease can lead to jaundice, anemia, heart failure, brain damage, and death."

According to Nippoldt (2015), offspring of men over 40 face an increased risk of miscarriages, autism, birth defects, achondroplasia (bone growth disorder) and schizophrenia. These increased health risks are thought to be due to accumulated chromosomal aberrations and mutations during the maturation of sperm cells in older men (Bray, Gunnell, & Smith, 2006). However, like older women, the overall risks are small.\nIn addition, men are more likely than women to work in occupations where hazardous chemicals, many of which have teratogenic effects or may cause genetic mutations, are used (Cordier, 2008). These may include petrochemicals, lead, and pesticides that can cause abnormal sperm and lead to miscarriages or diseases. Men are also more likely to be a source of second-hand smoke for their developing offspring.

It can also find out the age of the fetus, location of the placenta, fetal position, movement, breathing and heart rate, amount of amniotic fluid in the uterus, and number of fetuses. Most women have at least one ultrasound during pregnancy, but if problems are noted, additional ultrasounds may be recommended.\nWhen a diagnosis of a birth defect is necessary, ultrasounds help guide the more invasive diagnostic tests of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. Amniocentesis is a procedure in which a needle is used to withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid and cells from the sac surrounding the fetus and later tested. Chorionic villus sampling can identify birth defects or genetic disease by analyzing a small sample of cells taken from the placenta where it attaches to the wall of the uterus.\nFigure 3.13 - Amniocentesis. 94\n93 Image by MedicalPrudens is licensed under CC0 1.0\n94 Image by BruceBlaus is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0"

And although they are considered \"minor\", this is not to say that these problems are not potentially very uncomfortable. These side effects include nausea (particularly during the first 3-4 months of pregnancy as a result of higher levels of estrogen in the system), heartburn, gas, hemorrhoids, backache, leg cramps, insomnia, constipation, shortness of breath or varicose veins (as a result of carrying a heavy load on the abdomen). These are minor issues.\nBut there are also serious complications of pregnancy which can pose health risks to mother and child and that often require hospitalization.\nEctopic Pregnancy occurs when the zygote becomes attached to the fallopian tube before reaching the uterus. About 1 in 50 pregnancies in the United States are tubal pregnancies and this number has been increasing because of the higher rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia (Carroll, 2007). Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and fainting are symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.\nFigure 3.14 - An ectopic pregnancy. 95\nSpontaneous abortion, more commonly known as a miscarriage, is experienced in an estimated 20-40 percent of undiagnosed pregnancies and in another 10 percent of diagnosed pregnancies. Usually, the body aborts due to chromosomal abnormalities, and this typically happens before the 12th week of pregnancy. Cramping and bleeding result and normal periods return after several months. Some women are more likely to have repeated miscarriages due to chromosomal, amniotic, or hormonal problems, but miscarriage can also be a result of defective sperm (Carrell et. al., 2003).\nPreeclampsia , also known as Toxemia , is characterized by a sharp rise in blood pressure, a leakage of protein into the urine as a result of kidney problems, and swelling of the hands, feet, and face during the third trimester of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is the most common complication of pregnancy. When preeclampsia causes seizures, the condition is known as eclampsia, which is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States. Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low birth weight,\n95 Image by Takatakatakumi is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\npremature birth, and stillbirth. Treatment is typically bed rest and sometimes medication. If this treatment is ineffective, labor may be induced.\nMaternal Mortality : Approximately 1000 women die in childbirth around the world each day (World Health Organization, 2010). Rates are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, although there has been a substantial decrease in these rates. The campaign to make childbirth safe for everyone has led to the development of clinics accessible to those living in more isolated areas and training more midwives to assist in childbirth. 96"

Dick-Read Method / Mongan Method / Hypnobirthing, 1 = This method comes from the suggestion that the fear of childbirth increases tension and makes the process of childbearing more painful. It emphasizes the use of relaxation and proper breathing with contractions as well as family support and education.. Bradley Method, 1 = 'The Bradley Method focuses on preparing the mother for a natural childbirth coached by her partner. They learn techniques to reduce the perception of pain and stay relaxed. The emphasis is on being prepared for an unassisted vaginal birth without medication.' 98. Alexander Technique, 1 = This is a technique that can be used during childbirth that involves training to stop habitual reactions to pain, such as tensing muscles and increase conscious awareness and control over posture and movement. This involves being able to move freely and stay upright during labor and using body positioning that is beneficial to the labor process. 99. Waterbirth, 1 = Involves immersion in warm water. Proponents believe this method is safe and provides many benefits for both mother and infant, including pain relief and a less traumatic birth experience for the baby. However, critics argue that the procedure introduces unnecessary risks to the infant such as infection and water inhalation. 100. Lotus Birth, 1 = Or umbilical cord nonseverance - UCNS, is the practice of leaving the umbilical cord uncut after childbirth so that the baby is left attached to the placenta until the cord naturally separates at the umbilicus. This usually occurs within 3-10 days after birth. The practice is performed mainly for spiritual purposes of the parents, including for the perceived spiritual connection between placenta and newborn. 101.

As a pregnancy progresses into its final weeks, several physiological changes occur in response to hormones that trigger labor.\nA common sign that labor is beginning is the so-called 'bloody show.' During pregnancy, a plug of mucus accumulates in the cervical canal, blocking the entrance to the uterus. Approximately 1-2 days before the onset of true labor, this plug loosens and is expelled, along with a small amount of blood.\nAs labor nears, the mothers' pituitary gland produces oxytocin. This begins to stimulate stronger, more painful uterine contractions, which-in a positive feedback loop-stimulate the secretion of prostaglandins from fetal membranes. Like oxytocin, prostaglandins also enhance\n103 Image by liz.schrenk is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n104 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 59) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; Lifespan Development - Module 3: Prenatal Development by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\nuterine contractile strength.

These contractions may initially last about 30 seconds and be spaced 15 to 20 minutes apart. These increase in duration and frequency to more than a minute in length and about 3 to 4 minutes apart. Typically, doctors advise that they be called when contractions are coming about every 5 minutes. Some women experience false labor or Braxton-Hicks Contractions, especially with the first child. These may come and go. They tend to diminish when the mother begins walking around. Real labor pains tend to increase with walking. In one out of 8 pregnancies, the amniotic sac or water in which the fetus is suspended may break before labor begins. In such cases, the physician may induce labor with the use of medication if it does not begin on its own in order to reduce the risk of infection. Normally this sac does not rupture until the later stages of labor.\nThe first stage of labor is typically the longest. During this stage, the cervix or opening to the uterus dilates to 10 centimeters or just under 4 inches. This may take around 12-16 hours for first children or about 6-9 hours for women who have previously given birth. Labor may also begin with a discharge of blood or amniotic fluid.\nFigure 4.2 - Early cervical dilation. 106"

An epidural block with stronger medications, such as anesthetics, can be used shortly before a Cesarean Section or if a vaginal birth requires the use of forceps or vacuum extraction. 111\nWomen giving birth can also receive other pain medications (although medications given through injection can have negative side effects on the baby). In emergency situations (such as the need for a C-section), women may be given general anesthesia. They can also choose not to utilize any pain medications. That is often referred to as natural childbirth .\nFigure 4.5 - Natural childbirth. 112\nWomen can also use alternate positions (including standing, squatting, being on hands and knees, and using a birthing stool) and laboring, and even delivering in tubs of warm water to help relieve the pain of childbirth."

    "context_enriched_content": "Medical Interventions in Childbirth\nSometimes women cannot go into labor on their own and/or deliver vaginally. Let's look at induction of labor and Cesarean Sections.\nSometimes a baby's arrival may need to be induced before labor begins naturally. Induction of labor may be recommended for a variety of reasons when there is concern for the health of the mother or baby. For example:\n- The mother is approaching two weeks beyond her due date and labor has not started naturally\n111 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 60) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n112\nImage by U.S. Army Alaska is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n- The mother's water has broken, but contractions have not begun\n- There is an infection in the mother's uterus\n- The baby has stopped growing at the expected pace\n- There is not enough amniotic fluid surrounding the baby\n- The placenta peels away, either partially or completely, from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery\n- The mother has a medical condition that might put her or her baby at risk, such as high blood pressure or diabetes (Mayo Clinic, 2014).\nA Cesarean Section (C-section) is surgery to deliver the baby by being removed through the mother's abdomen. In the United States, 30% (about 1 in 3) of women have their babies delivered this way (Martin et al., 2015). Most C-sections are done when problems occur during delivery unexpectedly. These can include:\n- Health problems in the mother\n- Signs of distress in the baby\n- Not enough room for the baby to go through the vagina\n- The position of the baby, such as a breech presentation where the head is not in the downward position.\nFigure 4.6 - A woman receiving a C-section. 113\nFigure 4.7 - A baby being delivered by C-section. 114\nC-sections are also more common among women carrying more than one baby. Although the surgery is relatively safe for mother and baby, it is considered major surgery and carries health risks. Additionally, it also takes longer to recover from a C-section than from vaginal birth. After healing, the incision may leave a weak spot in the wall of the uterus. This could cause problems with an attempted vaginal birth later. In the past, doctors were hesitant to allow a vaginal birth after a C-section. However, now more than half of women who have a C-section go on to have a vaginal birth later. 115 This is referred to as a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) .\n113 Image by Tammra M is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n114 Image by Patricia Prudente on Unsplash\n115 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (page 61) by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

A significant consequence of preterm birth includes respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by weak and irregular breathing (see the image below). Premature babies often cannot yet regulate their own temperature or feed by nursing or bottle. They may struggle to regulate their heart rate effectively and may experience jaundice.

It may be particularly noticeable on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears, and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within a few weeks. Likewise, not all infants are born with lush heads of hair. Some may be nearly bald while others may have very fine, almost invisible hair. Some babies are even born with a full head of hair. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blond, even if the parents are not. The picture on the left shows lanugo on the shoulders of newborn twins.\nFigure 4.15 - Lanugo on the shoulder and back of twin girls. 127\nFigure 4.16 - A newborn baby covered in vernix. 128\nImmediately after birth, a newborn's skin is often grayish to dusky blue in color. As soon as the newborn begins to breathe, usually within a minute or two, the skin's color returns to its normal tone. Newborns are wet, covered in streaks of blood, and coated with a white substance known as vernix , which is thought to act as an antibacterial barrier, seen in the picture on the right.\nThe scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and the area around the eyes may be puffy.\nThe newborn may also have Mongolian spots (blue or blue-black birthmark on the lower back), various other birthmarks, or peeling skin, particularly on the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet. 129\nA newborn's genitals are enlarged and reddened, with male infants having an unusually large scrotum. The breasts may also be enlarged, even in male infants. This is caused by naturallyoccurring maternal hormones and is a temporary condition.\nThe umbilical cord of a newborn is bluish-white in color. After birth, the umbilical cord is normally cut, leaving a 1-2 inch stub. The umbilical stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. Occasionally, hospitals may apply triple dye to the umbilical stub to prevent infection, which may temporarily color the stub and surrounding skin purple.\n127 Image is in the public domain\n128 Image by Upsilon Andromedae is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n129 Mongolian Spot by Wiktionary is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\nFigure 4.17 - The clamping and cutting of a newborn's umbilical cord. 130\nNewborns lose many of the above physical characteristics quickly.

Within the US, significant disparities exist across racial groups in pregnancy-related deaths. From 2007 through 2016, the overall pregnancy-related mortality ratio (PRMR) was 16.7 pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 births. This rate is much higher for some ethnic groups.  For black women, the PRMR was 40.8 followed by American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women who experienced a PRMR of 29.7 while this figure was 12.7 for white women. This disparity was consistent over time and across age groups. The PRMR for black and AI/AN women over the age of 30 years was approximately four to five times that for their white counterparts.  Disparities persisted over\n139 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective (pages 76-77) by Martha Lally and Suzanne ValentineFrench is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n140\ntime and across age groups and were present even among groups with higher levels of education (Petersen et al., 2019; Melillo, 2020).\nRacial disparities also exist in rates of infant mortality, preterm birth, and low birthweight in the United States. More than 16% of black infants born in 2013 were born preterm, compared to only 10% of white infants.  Black infants had a low birthweight rate of 8.5% compared to 4.6% for white infants. The rate for very low birthweight for black infants was 2.8% vs. 1.06% for white infants (Martin et al.,2015). 2013 was not an anomaly; African-American infants have shown higher rates of preterm birth since the CDC began comparing data in 1981 (Centers for Disease Control, 2013).\nDespite efforts to improve racial disparities in birth outcomes, black infants are more than twice as likely as white infants to die in their first year of life. All of these disparities in birth outcomes exist even after researchers control for known medical and sociodemographic risk factors, such as low income, low education, and alcohol and tobacco use (Collins et al., 2004). The results can't be explained by the greater likelihood of black families experiencing poverty. Research shows that the gap in negative birth outcomes for black women compared to white widens as socioeconomic levels increase (Kleinman and Kessel, 1987; Collins et al., 2004).\nFigure 4.23 - This graph shows the racial disparities in the rate of SIDS. 142\nResearchers are beginning to conclude that exposure to racism and discrimination powerfully affect birth outcomes.  Hormones perform a central role in pregnancy and childbirth, including initiating the physiological process of labor. Relationships have been shown between elevated stress hormone levels and chronic exposures throughout life to stress in general. Such research suggests that those who experience racism and discrimination have measurably higher levels of stress hormones (Makrigiannakis, et al., 2007). These increased levels cause the body to remain 'chronically activated', unable to return to its normal state following a stressful event. A chronically activated maternal stress response may initiate pre-term labor (Latendresse, 2009).\n142 Image is in the public domain\nFigure 4.24 - Racism can be a chronic source of stress for women of color. 143\nAfrican-American women experience more chronic stress in their lives than white women, in part due to the effects of lifetime exposure to interpersonal racism (Stancil et al., 200; Geronimus et al., 2006). Black women who delivered very low birthweight infants reported more incidences of interpersonal racism than those who delivered higher weight infants at term. It has also been found that black participants who reported high levels of racial discrimination were at 3.1 times the risk of preterm delivery and almost 5 times more likely to deliver low birthweight infants (Mustillo et al., 2004).\nResearch also suggests that chronic stress, such as the discrimination that mothers experience can have effects on the developing fetus. Stimuli during critical periods of embryonic and fetal development may alter such development and influence lifelong health (Checkley, 1996)"

The first is Human Growth Hormone (HGH) which influences all growth except that in the Central Nervous System (CNS). The hormone influencing growth in the CNS is called Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.

The comparison in this graphic was originally introduced in the last chapter.\nFigure 5.3 - Shown from left to right: Human body proportions at birth, at 2 years, at 6 years, at 12 years, and 19 years. 148\nSome of the most dramatic physical change that occurs during this period is in the brain. At birth, the brain is about 25 percent of its adult weight and this is not true for any other part of the body. By age 2, it is at 75 percent its adult weight, at 95 percent by age 6.\nWhile most of the brain's 100 to 200 billion neurons are present at birth, they are not fully mature and during the next several years dendrites or connections between neurons will undergo a period of transient exuberance or temporary dramatic growth.\n148 Image by Ephert is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0"

This period of rapid neural growth is referred to as Synaptic Blooming. 151 This activity is occurring primarily in the cortex or the thin outer covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and thinking.\nThe prefrontal cortex that is located behind our forehead continues to grow and mature throughout childhood and experiences an additional growth spurt during adolescence.

Of course, this is not fully accomplished in infancy and toddlerhood, but continues throughout childhood and adolescence and even into adulthood.\nAnother major change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin , a coating of fatty tissues around the axon of the neuron. Myelin helps insulate the nerve cell and speed the rate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This enhances the building of neural pathways and improves coordination and control of movement and thought processes. The development of myelin continues into adolescence but is most dramatic during the first several years of life. 152\nFigure 5.5 - MRI scans of the human brain. 153"

These movements occur automatically and are signals that the infant is functioning well neurologically. Within the first several weeks of life, these reflexes are integrated and replaced with voluntary movements or motor skills. 154 It is important to give babies plenty of time laying on a firm surface while away (on both their backs and stomachs) to help integrate the reflexes, build healthy brain development, and develop future motor skills.\n152 Lifespan Development - Module 4: Infancy by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n153 Image is in the public domain\n154 Lifespan Development - Module 4: Infancy by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n|\nTable 5.1 - Some Common Infant Reflexes 155\n\nSucking, Description = Suck on anything that touches the lips.

At about 4 months of age, the infant is able to reach for an object, first with both arms and within a few weeks, with only one arm. The first type of grasp seen in the grasping an object is the ulnar grasp involves the whole hand, bringing the fingers to the palm, but not using thumbs.\nUse of the thumb comes at about 9 months of age when the infant is able to grasp an object using the forefinger and thumb. This is known as the pincer grip . This ability greatly enhances the ability to control and manipulate an object and infants take great delight in this newfound ability. They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in containers. And as those objects will often next go into the mouth, caregivers must be vigilant about keeping items small enough to be choking hazards out of reach of little fingers. By 9 months, an infant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches, grab it, and switch it from one hand to the other.

Newborns typically cannot see further than 8 to 16 inches away from their faces (which is about the distance from the newborn's face to the mother/caregiver when an infant is breastfeeding/bottle-feeding). Their visual acuity is about 20/400, which means that an infant can see something at 20 feet that an adult with normal vision could see at 400 feet. Thus, the world probably looks blurry to young infants. Because of their poor visual acuity, they look longer at checkerboards with fewer large squares than with many small squares. Infants' thresholds for seeing a visual pattern are higher than adults'. Thus, toys for infants are sometimes manufactured with black and white patterns rather than pastel colors because the higher contrast between black and white makes the pattern more visible to the immature visual system. By about 6 months, infants' visual acuity improves and approximates adult 20/25 acuity.\n|\nFigure 5.15 - An infant looking up at the person feeding them. 171\nWhen viewing a person's face, newborns do not look at the eyes the way adults do; rather, they tend to look at the chin-a less detailed part of the face. However, by 2 or 3 months, they will seek more detail when exploring an object visually and begin showing preferences for unusual images over familiar ones, for patterns over solids, for faces over patterns, and for threedimensional objects over flat images. Newborns have difficulty distinguishing between colors, but within a few months, they are able to discriminate between colors as well as adults do. Sensitivity to binocular depth cues, which require inputs from both eyes, is evident by about 3 months and continues to develop during the first 6 months. By 6 months, the infant can perceive depth perception in pictures as well (Sen, Yonas, & Knill, 2001). Infants who have experienced crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues of depth and modify their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007)."

Colostrum, the first breast milk produced during pregnancy and just after birth has been described as 'liquid gold' (United States Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), 2011). It is very rich in nutrients and antibodies. Breast milk changes by the third to fifth day after birth, becoming much thinner, but containing just the right amount of fat, sugar, water, and proteins to support overall physical and neurological development. For most babies, breast milk is also easier to digest than formula. Formula-fed infants experience more diarrhea and upset stomachs. The absence of antibodies in formula often results in a higher rate of ear infections and respiratory infections. Children who are breastfed have lower rates of childhood leukemia, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and a lower risk of SIDS. The USDHHS recommends that mothers breastfeed their infants exclusively (meaning without adding any other foods or starting solid foods) until at least 6 months of age and that breast milk is used in the diet throughout the first year or two.\nFigure 5.17 - A nurse helping a new mother to breastfeed. 174"

Mothers can certainly continue to provide breast milk to their babies by expressing and freezing the milk to be bottle-fed at a later time or by being available to their infants at feeding time. However, some mothers find that after the initial encouragement they receive in the hospital to breastfeed, the outside world is less supportive of such efforts. Workplaces are required by law to support breastfeeding mothers by providing a clean private area to pump (besides the bathroom) and allow breaks to do so, but often this is still difficult. In addition, a small number of women may be unable to breastfeed. Women with HIV are routinely discouraged from breastfeeding as the infection may pass to the infant. Similarly, women who are taking certain medications or undergoing radiation treatment may be told not to breastfeed (USDHHS, 2011). Mothers who breastfeed may have to watch their diets as some foods they eat may irritate their baby's digestive system.

In the early part of the 20 th century, breastfeeding began to go through another decline. By the 1950s, it was practiced less frequently as formula began to be viewed as superior to breast milk.\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, greater emphasis began to be placed on natural childbirth and breastfeeding and the benefits of breastfeeding were more widely publicized. Gradually rates of breastfeeding began to climb, particularly among middle-class educated mothers who received the strongest messages to breastfeed.\nToday, women receive consultation from lactation specialists before being discharged from the hospital to ensure that they are informed of the benefits of breastfeeding and given support and encouragement to get their infants to get used to taking the breast. This does not always happen immediately and first-time mothers, especially, can become upset or discouraged. In this case, lactation specialists and nursing staff can encourage the mother to keep trying until baby and mother are comfortable with the feeding. 175\n175 Children's Development by Ana R.

Infantile marasmus refers to starvation due to a lack of calories and protein. Children who do not receive adequate nutrition lose fat and muscle until their bodies can no longer function. Babies who are breastfed are much less at risk of malnutrition than those who are bottle-fed.\nAfter weaning from breastmilk, children who have diets deficient in protein may experience kwashiorkor or the 'disease of the displaced child,' often occurring after another child has been born and taken over breastfeeding. This results in a loss of appetite and swelling of the abdomen as the body begins to break down the vital organs as a source of protein.\nAround the world, the rates of wasting have been dropping. However, according to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, in 2014 there were 50 million children under the age of five that experienced these forms of wasting, and 16 million were severely wasted (UNICEF, 2015). Worldwide, these figures indicate that nearly 1 child in every 13 suffers from some form of wasting. The majority of these children live in Asia (34.3 million) and Africa (13.9 million).\n178 Image by Ben_Kerckx on Pixabay\nWasting can occur as a result of severe food shortages, regional diets that lack certain proteins and vitamins, or infectious diseases that inhibit appetite (Latham, 1997).\nFigure 5.20 - A child suffering from wasting. 179\nThe consequences of wasting depend on how late in the progression of the disease parents and guardians seek medical treatment for their children. Unfortunately, in some cultures families do not seek treatment early, and as a result by the time a child is hospitalized the child often dies within the first three days after admission (Latham, 1997). Several studies have reported longterm cognitive effects of early malnutrition (Galler & Ramsey, 1989; Galler, Ramsey, Salt & Archer, 1987; Richardson, 1980), even when home environments were controlled (Galler, Ramsey, Morley, Archer & Salt, 1990). Lower IQ scores (Galler et al., 1987), poor attention (Galler & Ramsey, 1989), and behavioral issues in the classroom (Galler et al., 1990) have been reported in children with a history of serious malnutrition in the first few years of life. 180"

Physicians often identify FTT during routine office visits, when a child's growth parameters are not tracking appropriately on growth curves.\nFTT can be caused by physical or mental issues within the child (such as errors of metabolism, acid reflux, anemia, diarrhea, Cystic fibrosis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, cleft palate, tongue tie, milk allergies, hyperthyroidism, congenital heart disease, etc.) It can also be caused by the caregiver's actions (environmental), including an inability to produce enough breastmilk, inadequate food supply, providing an insufficient number of feedings, and neglect. These causes may also co-exist. For instance, a child who is not getting sufficient nutrition may act content so that caregivers do not offer feedings of sufficient frequency or volume, and a child with severe acid reflux who appears to be in pain while eating may make a caregiver hesitant to offer sufficient feedings. 182"

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about one-fifth of all infants develop colic, usually starting between 2 and 4 weeks of age. They may cry inconsolably or scream, extend or pull up their legs, and pass gas. Their stomachs may be enlarged. The crying spells can occur anytime, although they often get worse in the early evening.\nThe colic will likely improve or disappear by the age of 3 or 4 months. There is no definite explanation for why some infants get colic. Health care providers can help ensure there is no medical reason behind the crying.\nSome infants seem to be soothed by being held, rocked, or wrapped snugly in a blanket. Some like a pacifier.\nFigure 5.22 - A father holding a crying infant. 184\n183 Image by Kevin Phillips is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n184\nImage by David D is licensed under CC BY 2.0"

Focus on calming yourself and understand that you may not be able to calm your baby. It's not your fault or your baby's. 185\nIt's normal for healthy babies to cry and some babies cry much more than others. And they cannot always be consoled and caregivers can feel pushed to the limit. When caregivers lose control and shake a baby it can have devastating effects.\nShaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is a severe form of physical child abuse. SBS may be caused from vigorously shaking an infant by the shoulders, arms, or legs. The 'whiplash' effect can cause intracranial (within the brain) or intraocular (within the eyes) bleeding. Often there is no obvious external head trauma. However, SBS can result in death, mental retardation or developmental delays, paralysis, severe motor dysfunction, spasticity, blindness, and seizures."

Shaking often occurs in response to a baby crying or having a toilet-training accident. The perpetrator tends to be male and is primarily the biological father or the mother's boyfriend or partner.

Caregivers often feel overwhelmed by a crying baby. Calling a friend, relative, or neighbor for support or assistance lets the caregiver take a break from the situation. If immediate support is not available, the caregiver could place the baby in a crib (making sure the baby is safe), close the door, and check on the baby every five minutes. 186\nFigure 5.23 - Medical professionals caring for an infant. 187"

The yellow color is caused by a buildup of bilirubin, a substance that is produced in the body during the normal process of breaking down old red blood cells and forming new ones.\nNormally the liver removes bilirubin from the body. But, for many infants, in the first few days after birth, the liver is not yet working at its full power. As a result, the level of bilirubin in the blood gets too high, causing the infant's color to become slightly yellow-this is jaundice. Although jaundice is common and usually not serious, in some cases, high levels of bilirubin could cause brain injury. All infants with jaundice need to be seen by a health care provider. Many infants need no treatment. Their livers start to catch up quickly and begin to remove bilirubin normally, usually within a few days after birth. For some infants, health care providers prescribe phototherapy-a treatment using a special lamp-to help break down the bilirubin in their bodies.\nFigure 5.25 - An infant receiving treatment for jaundice. 190"

    "context_enriched_content": "Protecting Health through Immunization\nOne way we can protect a child's health (and those around them) is through immunization. The vaccines (given through injection) may hurt a little…but the diseases they can prevent can hurt a lot more! Immunization shots, or vaccinations, are essential. They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as for children. Here's why.\nThe immune system helps the human body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does, the immune system 'remembers' the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.\nBefore vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.\n190 Image by Andres and Antoinette Ricardo used with permission\n103 | Child Growth and Development\nVaccines are the best defense we have against serious, preventable, and sometimes deadly contagious diseases. Vaccines are some of the safest medical products available, but like any other medical product, there may be risks.

No medicine is perfect, of course, but most childhood vaccines produce immunity about 90-100% of the time.\nWhat about the argument made by some people that vaccines don't work that well . . . that diseases would be going away on their own because of better hygiene or sanitation, even if there were no vaccines? That simply isn't true. Certainly better hygiene and sanitation can help prevent the spread of disease, but the germs that cause disease will still be around, and as long as they are they will continue to make people sick.\nAll vaccines must be licensed (approved) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before being used in the United States, and a vaccine must go through extensive testing to show that it works and that it is safe before the FDA will approve it. Among these tests are clinical trials, which compare groups of people who get a vaccine with groups of people who get a control. A vaccine is approved only if the FDA determines that it is safe and effective for its intended use.\n191 Image by Maria Immaculata Hospital is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n192 Disease Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles references Contemporary Health Issues by Judy Baker, Ph.D., licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n193 Making the Vaccine Decision by the CDC is in the public domain\nIf you look at the history of any vaccine-preventable disease, you will virtually always see that the number of cases of disease starts to drop when a vaccine is licensed.

    "context_enriched_content": "Opposition to Vaccines\nIn 2010, a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak in California sickened 9,143 people and resulted in 10 infant deaths: the worst outbreak in 63 years (Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Researchers, suspecting that the primary cause of the outbreak was the waning strength of pertussis vaccines in older children, recommended a booster vaccination for 11-12year-olds and also for pregnant women (Zacharyczuk 2011). Pertussis is most serious for babies; one in five needs to be hospitalized, and since they are too young for the vaccine themselves, it is crucial that people around them be immunized (Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Several states, including California, have been requiring the pertussis booster for older children in recent years with the hope of staving off another outbreak.\nBut what about people who do not want their children to have this vaccine, or any other? That question is at the heart of a debate that has been simmering for years. Vaccines have contributed to the eradication and weakening of numerous infectious diseases, including smallpox, polio, mumps, chickenpox, and meningitis. However, many people express concern about potential negative side effects from vaccines. These concerns range from fears about overloading the child's immune system to controversial reports about devastating side effects of the vaccines. 194\nFigure 5.27 - These two young children contracted polio. 195\n194 Disease Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles references Contemporary Health Issues by Judy Baker, Ph.D.,\nlicensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n195\nImage by the CDC is in the public domain\nAlthough children continue to get several vaccines up to their second birthday, these vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, an infant's healthy immune system successfully fights off thousands of antigens - the parts of germs that cause their immune system to respond. Even if your child receives several vaccines in one day, vaccines contain only a tiny number of antigens compared to the antigens a baby encounters every day.\nThis is the case even if your child receives combination vaccines. Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. Children get the same protection as they do from individual vaccines given separately-but with fewer shots. 196\nOne misapprehension is that the vaccine itself might cause the disease it is supposed to be immunizing against. 197 Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but this 'imitation' infection does not cause illness. Instead, it causes the immune system to develop the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recognize and fight the vaccinepreventable disease in the future. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. 198\nAnother commonly circulated concern is that vaccinations, specifically the MMR vaccine (MMR stands for measles, mumps, and rubella), are linked to autism. The autism connection has been particularly controversial. In 1998, a British physician named Andrew Wakefield published a study in Great Britain's Lancet magazine that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The report received a lot of media attention, resulting in British immunization rates decreasing from 91 percent in 1997 to almost 80 percent by 2003, accompanied by a subsequent rise in measles cases (Devlin 2008). A prolonged investigation by the British Medical Journal proved that not only was the link in the study nonexistent, but that Dr. Wakefield had falsified data in order to support his claims (CNN 2011). Dr. Wakefield was discredited and stripped of his license, but the doubt still lingers in many parents' minds.\nIn the United States, many parents still believe in the now-discredited MMR-autism link and refuse to vaccinate their children. Other parents choose not to vaccinate for various reasons like religious or health beliefs. In one instance, a boy whose parents opted not to vaccinate returned home to the U.S. after a trip abroad; no one yet knew he was infected with measles. The boy exposed 839 people to the disease and caused 11 additional cases of measles, all in other unvaccinated children, including one infant who had to be hospitalized.\n196 Making the Vaccine Decision by the CDC is in the public domain\n197 Disease Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles references Contemporary Health Issues by Judy Baker, Ph.D., licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n198\nMaking the Vaccine Decision by the CDC is in the public domain\nFigure 5.28 - A baby with measles 199"

    "context_enriched_content": "Piaget and Sensorimotor Intelligence\nPiaget describes intelligence in infancy as sensorimotor or based on direct, physical contact. Infants taste, feel, pound, push, hear, and move in order to experience the world. Let's explore the transition infants make from responding to the external world reflexively as newborns to solving problems using mental strategies as two years old.\n214 Children's Development by Ana R. Leon is licensed under CC BY 4.0\nTable 6.1 - Substages of Piaget's Sensorimotor Stage 215\n\nSubstage One: Simple Reflexes, Age = Birth to 1 month. Substage One: Simple Reflexes, Description = This active learning begins with automatic movements or reflexes. A ball comes into contact with an infant's cheek and is automatically sucked on and licked.. Substage Two: Primary Circular Reactions, Age = 1 to 4 months. Substage Two: Primary Circular Reactions, Description = The infant begins to discriminate between objects and adjust responses accordingly as reflexes are replaced with voluntary movements. An infant may accidentally engage in a behavior and find it interesting such as making a vocalization. This interest motivates trying to do it again and helps the infant learn a new behavior that originally occurred by chance. At first, most actions have to do with the body, but in months to come, actions will be directed more toward objects.. Substage Three: Secondary Circular Reactions, Age = 4 to 8 months. Substage Three: Secondary Circular Reactions, Description = The infant becomes more and more actively engaged in the outside world and takes delight in being able to make things happen. Although not initially goal-directed, infants will now intentionally repeat actions, like dropping an object or shaking a rattle, in order to prolong an interesting experience.. Substage Four: Coordination of circular reactions, Age = 8 to 12 months. Substage Four: Coordination of circular reactions, Description = The infant can engage in behaviors that others perform and anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of continued maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant becomes capable of having a thought and carrying out a planned, goal-directed activity such as seeking a toy that has rolled under the couch. The object continues to exist in the infant's mind even when out of sight and the infant now is capable of making attempts to retrieve it.. Substage Five: Tertiary Circular Reactions, Age = 12 to 18 months. Substage Five: Tertiary Circular Reactions, Description = The infant more actively engages in experimentation to learn about the physical world. Gravity is learned by pouring water from a cup or pushing bowls from high chairs. The caregiver tries to help the child by picking it up again and placing it on the tray. And what happens? Another experiment! The child pushes it off the tray again causing it to fall and the caregiver to pick it up again!. Substage Six: Internalization of Schemes and Early Representational thought, Age = 18 months to 2 years. Substage Six: Internalization of Schemes and Early Representational thought, Description = The child is now able to solve problems using mental strategies, to remember something heard days before and repeat it, to engage in pretend play, and to find objects that have been moved even when out of sight. Take, for instance, the child who is upstairs in a room with the door closed, supposedly taking a nap. The doorknob has a safety device on it that makes it impossible for the child to turn the knob. After trying several times in vain to push the door or turn the doorknob, the child carries out a mental strategy learned from prior experience to get the door opened-he knocks on the door! The child is now better equipped with mental strategies for problem-solving.\n215 Children's Development by Ana R.

However, the infant's cognitive world is not as neatly packaged as Piaget portrayed it, and some of Piaget's explanations for the cause of change are debated. In the past several decades, sophisticated experimental techniques have been devised to study infants, and there have been a large number of research studies on infant development. Much of the new research suggests that Piaget's view of sensorimotor development needs to be modified (Baillargeon, 2014; Brooks & Meltzoff, 2014; Johnson & Hannon, 2015)."

    "context_enriched_content": "The A-not-B Error\nThe data does not always support Piaget's claim that certain processes are crucial in transitions from one stage to the next. For example, in Piaget's theory, an important feature in the progression into substage 4, coordination of secondary circular reactions, is an infant's inclination to search for a hidden object in a familiar location rather than to look for the object in a new location. Thus, if a toy is hidden twice, initially at location A and subsequently at location B, 8- to 12-month-old infants search correctly at location A initially. But when the toy is subsequently hidden at location B, they make the mistake of continuing to search for it at location A. A-not-B error is the term used to describe this common mistake. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because their concept of object permanence is more complete.\n216 Image by holycalamity is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\nResearchers have found, however, that the A-not-B error does not show up consistently (Sophian, 1985). The evidence indicates that A-not-B errors are sensitive to the delay between hiding the object at B and the infant's attempt to find it (Diamond, 1985). Thus, the A-not-B error might be due to a failure in memory. Another explanation is that infants tend to repeat a previous motor behavior (Clearfield & others, 2006; Smith, 1999)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Development Is Determined by Environmental Factors\nPiaget set the tone for much of current-day research but his theory has also received a great deal of criticism. Many believe that Piaget ignored the huge influence that society and culture have in shaping a child's development. At a similar time, another researcher named Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) had come to similar conclusions as Piaget about children's development, in thinking that children learned about the world through physical interaction with it. However, where Piaget felt that children moved naturally through different stages of development, based on biological predispositions and their individual interactions with the world, Vygotsky claimed that adult or peer intervention was a much more important part of the developmental process.\nVygotsky concentrated more on the child's immediate social and cultural environment and his or her interactions with adults and peers. He argued that development occurred first through children's immediate social interactions, and then moved to the individual level as they began to internalize their learning. While Piaget saw the child as actively discovering the world through individual interactions with it, Vygotsky saw the child as more of an apprentice, learning through a social environment of others who had more experience and were sensitive to the child's needs and abilities. 217\nFigure 6.2 - An adult playing Legos with a child. 218\n217 Children's Development by Ana R.

    "context_enriched_content": "Stages of Language Development\n1. Intentional Vocalizations - Cooing and taking turns: Infants begin to vocalize and repeat vocalizations within the first couple of months of life. That gurgling, musical vocalization called cooing can serve as a source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid down for a nap or seated in a carrier on a car ride. Cooing serves as practice for vocalization as well, as the infant hears the sound of his or her voice and tries to repeat entertaining sounds. Infants also begin to learn the pace and pause of conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else and then take their turn again when the other person's vocalization has stopped. Cooing initially involves making vowel sounds like 'oooo'. Later, consonants are added to vocalizations such as 'nananananana'.\n2. Babbling and gesturing: At about four to six months of age, infants begin making even more elaborate vocalizations that include the sounds required for any language. Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel sounds stand ready to equip the child with the ability to repeat whatever sounds are characteristic of the language heard. Eventually, these sounds will no longer be used as the infant grows more accustomed to a particular language. Deaf babies also use gestures to communicate wants, reactions, and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier than vocalization for some toddlers, sign language is sometimes taught to enhance one's ability to communicate by making use of the ease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language is used when deaf babies sign just as it is when hearing babies babble.\n3. Understanding: At around ten months of age, the infant can understand more than he or she can say. You may have experienced this phenomenon as well if you have ever tried to learn a second language. You may have been able to follow a conversation more easily than to contribute to it.\n4. Holophrastic speech: Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of age and may use partial words to convey thoughts at even younger ages. These oneword expressions are referred to as holophrastic speech . For example, the child may say 'ju' for the word 'juice' and use this sound when referring to a bottle. The listener must interpret the meaning of the holophrase and when this is someone who has spent time with the child, interpretation is not too difficult. They know that 'ju' means 'juice' which means the baby wants some milk! But someone who has not been around the child will have trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent who to a friend exclaims, 'Ezra's talking all the time now!' The friend hears only 'ju da ga' which, the parent explains, means 'I want some milk when I go with Daddy.'"

    "context_enriched_content": "Stages of Language Development\n5. Underextension: A child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think that the word can be used for only that particular object. Only the family's Irish Setter is a 'doggie'. This is referred to as underextension. More often, however, a child may think that a label applies to all objects that are similar to the original object. In overextension , all animals become 'doggies', for example.\n6. First words and cultural influences: First words in English tend to be nouns. The child labels objects such as cup or ball. In a verb-friendly language such as Chinese, however, children may learn more verbs. This may also be due to the different emphasis given to objects based on culture. Chinese children may be taught to notice action and relationship between objects while children from the United States may be taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size, etc.). These differences can be seen when comparing interpretations of art by older students from China and the United States.\n7. Vocabulary growth spurt: One-year-olds typically have a vocabulary of about 50 words. But by the time they become toddlers, they have a vocabulary of about 200 words and begin putting those words together in telegraphic speech (It can now be thought of as 'text message' speech because texting is more common and is similar in that text messages typically only include the minimal amount of words to convey the message).\n8. Two-word sentences and telegraphic speech : Words are soon combined and 18-monthold toddlers can express themselves further by using expressions such as 'baby byebye' or 'doggie pretty'. Words needed to convey messages are used, but the articles and other parts of speech necessary for grammatical correctness are not yet used. These expressions sound like a telegraph (or perhaps a better analogy today would be that they read like a text message) where unnecessary words are not used. 'Give baby ball' is used rather than 'Give the baby the ball.' Or a text message of 'Send money now!' rather than 'Dear Mother.  I really need some money to take care of my expenses.' 221"

It involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a high-pitched voice, and delivering the phrase with great facial expression. Why is this done? It may be to clearly articulate the sounds of a word so that the child can hear the sounds involved.

How do you compare with your siblings or other children you have known well? You may have noticed that some seemed to be in a better mood than others and that some were more sensitive to noise or more easily distracted than others. These differences may be attributed to temperament. Temperamen t is the innate characteristics of the infant, including mood, activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable soon after birth.\nIn a 1956 landmark study, Chess and Thomas (1996) evaluated 141 children's temperament based on parental interviews. Referred to as the New York Longitudinal Study, infants were assessed on 10 dimensions of temperament including:\n- activity level\n- rhythmicity (regularity of biological functions)\n- threshold of responsiveness (how intense a stimulus has to be for the child to react)\n- approach/withdrawal (how children deal with new things)\n- adaptability to situations\n- quality of mood\n- distractibility\n- attention span\n- intensity of reactions\n- persistence\nBased on the infants' behavioral profiles, they were categorized into three general types of temperament:\nTable 7.1 - Types of Temperament\n\nEasy, Percentage = 40%. Easy, Description = ● Able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations ● Remains calm ● Easy to soothe ● Usually in a positive mood. Difficult, Percentage = 10%. Difficult, Description = ● Reacts negatively to new situations ● Has trouble adapting to routine ● Usually negative in mood ● Cries frequently. Slow-to-warm- up, Percentage = 15%. Slow-to-warm- up, Description = ● Low activity level ● Adjusts slowly to new situations ● Often negative in mood\nAs can be seen, the percentages do not equal 100% as some children were not able to be placed neatly into one of the categories. Think about how each type of child should be approached to improve interactions with them. An easy child requires less intervention, but still has needs that must not be overlooked. A slow-to-warm-up child may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations are going to be introduced. A child with a difficult temperament may need to be given extra time to burn off their energy.\nA caregiver's ability to work well and accurately read the child will enjoy a goodness-of-fit , meaning their styles match, and communication and interaction can flow . Parents who recognize each child's temperament and accept it, will nurture more effective interactions with the child and encourage more adaptive functioning. 224\nFigure 7.1 - This adventurous child's parents provide a good 'fit' to her temperament. 225\n224 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n225\nImage is licensed under CC0 1.0"

    "context_enriched_content": "Parenting Is Bidirectional\nNot only do parents affect their children, children influence their parents. A child's characteristics, such as temperament, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For example, an infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more effective, as they are easily able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive reactions from his or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting role (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult children may become more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater challenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith, 2004). Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that influence how parents behave with their children."

Temperament may be one of the things about us that stays the same throughout development. In contrast, personality , defined as an individual's consistent pattern of feeling, thinking, and behaving , is the result of the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience.\nPersonality also develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin, 2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for selfcontrol advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. For example, a newborn who cries frequently doesn't necessarily have a grumpy personality; over time, with sufficient parental support and an increased sense of security, the child might be less likely to cry.\nPersonality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children's developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, as well as many other qualities are encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even more by the child's experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the growth of individual characteristics. Also, their cultural values can influence their personality (some value independence while others value group needs over individual needs). Indeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn that parents gazed upon thus becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance. 226\n226 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

For example, aggression and assertiveness have historically been emphasized as positive masculine personality traits in the United States. Meanwhile, submissiveness and caretaking have historically been held as ideal feminine traits. While many gender roles remain the same, others change over time. In 1938, for example, only 1 out of 5 Americans agreed that a married woman should earn money in industry and business. By 1996, however, 4 out of 5 Americans approved of women working in these fields. This type of attitude change has been accompanied by behavioral shifts that coincide with changes in trait expectations and shifts in personal identity for men and women. 229"

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant Emotions\nAt birth, infants exhibit two emotional responses: attraction and withdrawal. They show attraction to pleasant situations that bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they withdraw from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors or physical discomfort. At 6 weeks, infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they respond with smiles to those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).\nThe Social smile becomes more stable and organized as infants learn to use their smiles to engage their parents in interactions. Pleasure is expressed as laughter at 3 to 5 months of age, and displeasure becomes more specific as fear, sadness, or anger between ages 6 and 8\n227 Image by Abdullah Shakoor on Pixabay\n228 Image is licensed under CC0 1.0\n229 Lifespan Development - Module 4: Infancy by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\nmonths. Anger is often the reaction to being prevented from obtaining a goal, such as a toy being removed (Braungart-Rieker, Hill-Soderlund, & Karrass, 2010). In contrast, sadness is typically the response when infants are deprived of a caregiver (Papousek, 2007). Fear is often associated with the presence of a stranger, known as stranger wariness , or the departure of significant others known as separation anxiety. Both appear sometime between 6 and 15 months after object permanence has been acquired. Further, there is some indication that infants may experience jealousy as young as 6 months of age (Hart & Carrington, 2002).\nFigure 7.4 - An infant making an angry facial expression. 230\nEmotions are often divided into two general categories: Basic emotions (primary emotions), such as interest, happiness, anger, fear, surprise, sadness and disgust, which appear first, and self-conscious emotions (secondary emotions), such as envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and embarrassment. Unlike primary emotions, secondary emotions appear as children start to develop a self-concept, and require social instruction on when to feel such emotions. The situations in which children learn self-conscious emotions vary from culture to culture. Individualistic cultures teach us to feel pride in personal accomplishments, while in more collective cultures, children are taught to not call attention to themselves, unless you wish to feel embarrassed for doing so (Akimoto & Sanbinmatsu, 1999).\nFacial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the developmental literature, this concept has been investigated under the concept of social referencing ; that is, the process whereby infants seek out information from others to clarify a situation and then use that information to act (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983). To date, the strongest demonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the first study to investigate this concept, Campos and colleagues (Sorce, Emde, Campos, & Klinnert, 1985) placed mothers on the far end of the 'cliff' from the infant. Mothers first smiled to the infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began\n230 Image by Brytny.com on Unsplash\ncrawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the mother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were clearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the table when the mother showed fear; only 6% did when the mother posed anger, 33% crossed when the mother posed sadness, and approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother posed joy or interest.\nFigure 7.5 - An infant making a sad facial expression 231 .\nOther studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction. Researchers posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition the babies showed in touching the object (Bradshaw, 1986). The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the same: Anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This study was later replicated using joy and disgust expressions, altering the method so that the infants were not allowed to touch the toy (compared with a distractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). At 14 months of age, significantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the infants saw disgust."

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant Emotions\nA final emotional change is in self-regulation. Emotional self-regulation refers to strategies we use to control our emotional states so that we can attain goals (Thompson & Goodvin, 2007). This requires effortful control of emotions and initially requires assistance from caregivers (Rothbart, Posner, & Kieras, 2006). Young infants have very limited capacity to adjust their emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. Caregivers can offer distractions to redirect the infant's attention and comfort to reduce the emotional distress. As areas of the infant's prefrontal cortex continue to develop, infants can tolerate more stimulation. By 4 to 6 months, babies can begin to shift their attention away from\n231 Image by acheron0 is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nupsetting stimuli (Rothbart et al, 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively communicate their need for help and can crawl or walk toward or away from various situations (Cole, Armstrong, & Pemberton, 2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament also plays a role in children's ability to control their emotional states, and individual differences have been noted in the emotional self-regulation of infants and toddlers (Rothbart & Bates, 2006). 232\nFigure 7.6 - A toddler at a park. 233\nDevelopment of Sense of Self: During the second year of life, children begin to recognize themselves as they gain a sense of self as separate from their primary caregiver. In a classic experiment by Lewis and Brooks (1978) children 9 to 24 months of age were placed in front of a mirror after a spot of rouge was placed on their nose as their mothers pretended to wipe something off the child's face. If the child reacted by touching his or her nose rather than that of the 'baby' in the mirror, it was taken to suggest that the child recognized the reflection as him or herself. Lewis and Brooks found that somewhere between 15 and 24 months most infants developed a sense of self-awareness. Self-awareness is the realization that you are separate from others (Kopp, 2011). Once a child has achieved self-awareness, the child is moving toward understanding social emotions such as guilt, shame, or embarrassment, as well as, sympathy or empathy. 234"

The first mother (the wire mother) consisted of a round wooden head, a mesh of cold metal wires, and a bottle of milk from which the baby monkey could drink. The second mother was a foam-rubber form wrapped in a heated terry-cloth blanket. The infant monkeys went to the wire mother for food, but they overwhelmingly preferred and spent significantly more time with the warm terry-cloth mother. The warm terrycloth mother provided no food but did provide comfort (Harlow, 1958). The infant's need for physical closeness and touching is referred to as contact comfort . Contact comfort is believed to be the foundation for attachment. The Harlows' studies confirmed that babies have social as well as physical needs. Both monkeys and human babies need a secure base that allows them to feel safe. From this base, they can gain the confidence they need to venture out and explore their worlds."

He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). An infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional development. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues throughout life. He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child (Bowlby, 1982). A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as the child explores the surroundings .\n237 Image by splotter_nl is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nFigure 7.9 - A mother offering a secure base as her infant plays on a slide . 238\nBowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be responsive to the child's physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969). Additionally, Bowlby observed that infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents, such as crying, refusing to be comforted, and waiting for the caregiver to return.\nFigure 7.10 - This child is seeking comfort from an attachment figure. 239\nBowlby also observed that these same expressions were common to many other mammals, and consequently argued that these negative responses to separation serve an evolutionary function. Because mammalian infants cannot feed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and protection of adults for survival. Thus, those infants who were able to maintain proximity to an attachment figure were more likely to survive and reproduce.\n238\nImage is licensed under CC0\n239\nImage on Pexels"

Erikson agreed on the importance of a secure base, arguing that the most important goal of infancy was the development of a basic sense of trust in one's caregivers. Consequently, the first stage, trust vs. mistrust, highlights the importance of attachment. Erikson maintained that the first year to year and a half of life involves the establishment of a sense of trust (Erikson, 1982). Infants are dependent and must rely on others to meet their basic physical needs as well as their needs for stimulation and comfort. A caregiver who consistently meets these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the world is a trustworthy place. The caregiver should not worry about overindulging a child's need for comfort, contact, or stimulation.\nFigure 7.11 - This baby-wearing father is creating trust with his infant child. 240"

    "context_enriched_content": "Mary Ainsworth and the Strange Situation\nDevelopmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that measured an infant's attachment to his or her parent. The test is called The Strange Situation because it is conducted in a context that is unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely to heighten the child's need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).\nFigure 7.12 - An infant crawling on the floor with toys around as done in the Strange Situation. 241\nDuring the procedure, which lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone, while the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for a minute to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters and the stranger leaves the room. During the entire session, a video camera records the child's behaviors, which are later coded by the research team. The investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the caregiver leaving and returning to the room, referred to as the 'reunion.' Based on their behaviors, the children are categorized into one of four groups where each group reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure and the other three styles are referred to as insecure.\n- A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is present and may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be upset when the caregiver departs, but is also happy to see the caregiver return.\n- A child with an ambivalent (sometimes called resistant) attachment style is wary about the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush to the caregiver, but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry and even resist attempts to be soothed.\n241 Image is in the public domain\n- A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.\n- A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent way of coping with the stress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall to the floor.\nHow common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be characterized as disorganized.\nSome cultural differences in attachment styles have been found (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2010). For example, German parents value independence and Japanese mothers are typically by their children's sides. As a result, the rate of insecure-avoidant attachments is higher in Germany and insecure-resistant attachments are higher in Japan. These differences reflect cultural variation rather than true insecurity, however (van Ijzendoorn and Sagi, 1999).\nKeep in mind that methods for measuring attachment styles have been based on a model that reflects middle-class, U. S. values and interpretation. Newer methods for assessment attachment styles involve using a Q-sort technique in which a large number of behaviors are recorded on cards and the observer sorts the cards in a way that reflects the type of behavior that occurs within the situation (Waters, 1987) . There are 90 items in the third version of the Qsort technique, and examples of the behaviors assessed include:\n- When child returns to mother after playing, the child is sometimes fussy for no clear reason.\n- When the child is upset or injured, the child will accept comforting from adults other than mother.\n- Child often hugs or cuddles against mother, without her asking or inviting the child to do so.\n- When the child is upset by mother's leaving, the child continues to cry or even gets angry after she is gone.\nAt least two researchers observe the child and parent in the home for 1.5-2 hours per visit. Usually, two visits are sufficient to gather adequate information. The parent is asked if the behaviors observed are typical for the child. This information is used to test the validity of the Strange Situation classifications across age, cultures, and clinical populations."

Resiliency can be attributed to certain personality factors, such as an easy-going temperament. Some children are warm, friendly, and responsive, whereas others tend to be more irritable, less manageable, and difficult to console, and these differences play a role in attachment (Gillath, Shaver, Baek, & Chun, 2008; Seifer, Schiller, Sameroff, Resnick, & Riordan, 1996). It seems safe to say that attachment, like most other developmental processes, is affected by an interplay of genetic and socialization influences.\nReceiving support from others also leads to resiliency. A positive and strong support group can help a parent and child build a strong foundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes toward the newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher van den Boom (1994) randomly assigned some babies' mothers to a training session in which they learned to better respond to their children's needs. The research found that these mothers' babies were more likely to show a secure attachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control group that did not receive training. 243\nFigure 7.14 - This infant massage class for new mothers could provide training and support for mothers. 244"

However, children between the ages of 2 and 3 need 1,000 to 1,400 calories, while children between the ages of 4 and 8 need 1,200 to 2,000 calories (Mayo Clinic, 2016a). 250\nCaregivers who have established a feeding routine with their child can find the reduction in appetite a bit frustrating and become concerned that the child is going to starve. However, by providing adequate, sound nutrition, and limiting sugary snacks and drinks, the caregiver can be assured that 1) the child will not starve; and 2) the child will receive adequate nutrition. Preschoolers can experience iron deficiencies if not given well-balanced nutrition or if they are given too much milk as calcium interferes with the absorption of iron in the diet as well.\nCaregivers need to keep in mind that they are setting up taste preferences at this age. Young children who grow accustomed to high fat, very sweet, and salty flavors may have trouble eating foods that have more subtle flavors such as fruits and vegetables. Consider the following advice about establishing eating patterns for years to come (Rice, F.P., 1997). Notice that keeping mealtime pleasant, providing sound nutrition, and not engaging in power struggles over food are the main goals. 251"

    "context_enriched_content": "Tips for Establishing Healthy Eating Habits\n1. Don't try to force your child to eat or fight over food. Of course, it is impossible to force someone to eat. But the real advice here is to avoid turning food into a power struggle so that food doesn't become a way to gain favor with or express anger toward someone else.\n2. Recognize that appetite varies. Children may eat well at one meal and have no appetite at another. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it may help to realize that appetites do vary. Continue to provide good nutrition at each mealtime (even if children don't choose to eat the occasional meal).\n3. Keep it pleasant. This tip is designed to help caregivers create a positive atmosphere during mealtime. Mealtimes should not be the time for arguments or expressing\n250 Children's Development by Ana R. Leon is licensed under CC BY 4.0\nLifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n251 Children's Development by Ana R. Leon is licensed under CC BY 4.0\ntensions. You do not want the child to have painful memories of mealtimes together or have nervous stomachs and problems eating and digesting food due to stress.\n4. No short-order chefs. While it is fine to prepare foods that children enjoy, preparing a different meal for each child or family member sets up an unrealistic expectation from others. Children probably do best when they are hungry and a meal is ready. Limiting snacks rather than allowing children to 'graze' continuously can help create an appetite for whatever is being served.\n5. Limit choices. If you give your preschool-aged child choices, make sure that you give them one or two specific choices rather than asking 'What would you like for lunch?' If given an open choice, children may change their minds or choose whatever their sibling does not choose!\n6. Serve balanced meals. Meals prepared at home tend to have better nutritional value than fast food or frozen dinners. Prepared foods tend to be higher in fat and sugar content as these ingredients enhance taste and profit margin because fresh food is often more costly and less profitable. However, preparing fresh food at home is not costly. It does, however, require more activity. Including children in meal preparation can provide a fun and memorable experience.\n7. Don't bribe. Bribing a child to eat vegetables by promising dessert is not a good idea. First, the child will likely find a way to get the dessert without eating the vegetables (by whining or fidgeting, perhaps, until the caregiver gives in). Secondly, it teaches the child that some foods are better than others. Children tend to naturally enjoy a variety of foods until they are taught that some are considered less desirable than others. A child, for example, may learn the broccoli they have enjoyed is seen as yucky by others unless it's smothered in cheese sauce! 252\n8. Involve children in planning, purchasing, and preparing meals. Have children help create a written menu or place settings for dinner. Have children help pick healthy foods to buy at the grocery store or farmer's market. Involve the child in trying to find how they can eat all the colors of the rainbow. Encourage even young children to help cook in the kitchen.\nFigure 8.2 - Two children cooking together. 253\n252 Children's Development by Ana R.

The child's age is not as important as his/her physical and emotional readiness. If started too early, it might take longer to train a child.\nAccording to The Mayo Clinic (2016b), the following questions can help parents determine if a child is ready for toilet training:\n- Does your child seem interested in the potty chair or toilet, or in wearing underwear?\n- Can your child understand and follow basic directions?\n- Does your child tell you through words, facial expressions or posture when he or she needs to go?\n- Does your child stay dry for periods of two hours or longer during the day?\n- Does your child complain about wet or dirty diapers?\n- Can your child pull down his or her pants and pull them up again?\n- Can your child sit on and rise from a potty chair?\nIf a child resists being trained or training is not successful after a few weeks, it is best to take a break and try again when they show more significant interest in the process. Most children master daytime bladder control first, typically within two to three months of consistent toilet training.

Lower-income individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity, are often in poorer health than those in higherincome brackets. An individual's income may influence many other determinants of health status, such as one's access to educational opportunities, decent medical care, and affordable housing in a healthy community (Adler and Newman, 2002).\nViolence and crime have a disproportionate impact on minority neighborhoods (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). Neighborhoods with a higher incidence of violent crime are less likely to have quality recreational facilities and grocery stores offering better nutritional options, thus promoting better dietary choices (Cheadle et al., 1991). Also, neighborhoods with a higher incidence of crime are less likely to have convenient medical facilities for primary care services, making access to health care worse.\nFigure 8.15 - Living conditions in poor neighborhoods disadvantage the development of children living there. 289\nRacial and ethnic minority families are disproportionately exposed to harmful environmental toxins in their communities, workplaces, and schools (Shavers and Shavers, 2006). Asthma rates, among African Americans in particular, increase dramatically in areas where environmental dangers persist. In some areas of the country, one in four Black individuals is diagnosed with asthma, a chronic respiratory disease (Bell & Standish, 2005). Factors influencing asthma include exposure to air pollutants, like automobile and industrial plant emissions. As such, studies have shown that children who live near freeways are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than other youths. Other research shows that a disproportionate number of Hispanics and Asian and Pacific Islanders reside in areas that fail to meet air quality-level standards ( Healthypeople.gov. Healthy People 2010, 2009) . It has also been shown that other toxic pollutants, such as mercury, are disproportionately found in women of certain racial and ethnic minorities. Exposure to mercury can cause neurologic damage in fetuses and children and may harm the body's nervous immune and cardiovascular systems ( Payne-Sturgis and Gee , 2006).\n289 Image is in the public domain"

The sources of racial and ethnic health care disparities include differences in geography, lack of access to adequate health coverage, communication difficulties between patient and provider, cultural barriers, provider stereotyping, and lack of access to providers (Brenden et al., 2008). Closing the disparity gap is not only professionally and morally imperative for the medical profession, it remains a glaring civil rights injustice that must be addressed.\nDisparities in the health care system contribute to the overall disparities in general health measures that affect racial and ethnic minorities. An individual's health statistics are influenced not only by the health care system, but also environmental, genetic, and social determinants. Racial and ethnic minorities have present-day health statistics that are much lower than those for whites (Heron et al.,2006; MacDorman and Mathews, 2009; Williams, 2007; Satcher et al.,2005) These disparities exist in the context of broader social and economic inequity and racial and ethnic discrimination that have become all too painfully clear recently."

For example, while adults have no concerns with taking a bath, a child of three might genuinely worry about being sucked down the drain. 290\nFigure 9.1 - A child in a bathtub. 291\n290 Lifespan Development - Module 5: Early Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology\nby Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n291\nImage by Ian Cameron is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nA child might protest if told that something will happen 'tomorrow' but be willing to accept an explanation that an event will occur 'today after we sleep.'

A father gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to 3-year-old Kenny. Kenny's pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than she did. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza into smaller pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was because Kenny exhibited Centration, or focused on only one characteristic of an object to the exclusion of others.\nKenny focused on the five pieces of pizza to his sister's one piece even though the total amount was the same. Keiko was able to consider several characteristics of an object than just one. Because children have not developed this understanding of conservation, they cannot perform mental operations.\nThe classic Piagetian experiment associated with conservation involves liquid (Crain, 2005). As seen below, the child is shown two glasses (as shown in a) which are filled to the same level and asked if they have the same amount. Usually, the child agrees they have the same amount. The researcher then pours the liquid from one glass to a taller and thinner glass (as shown in b). The child is again asked if the two glasses have the same amount of liquid. The preoperational child will typically say the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller. The child has concentrated on the height of the glass and fails to conserve. 296\nFigure 9.4 - Piagetian liquid conservation experiments. 297\n295 Lifespan Development - Module 5: Early Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n296 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n297 Image by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

With the right kind of teaching, however, they can accomplish it successfully. A good teacher identifies a child's ZPD and helps the child stretch beyond it. Then the adult (teacher) gradually withdraws support until the child can then perform the task unaided. Researchers have applied the metaphor of scaffolds (the temporary platforms on which construction workers stand) to this way of teaching.

Vygotsky, however, believed that children talk to themselves in order to solve problems or clarify thoughts. As children learn to think in words, they do so aloud before eventually closing their lips and engaging in private speech or inner speech.\nThinking out loud eventually becomes thought accompanied by internal speech, and talking to oneself becomes a practice only engaged in when we are trying to learn something or remember something.

    "context_enriched_content": "Memory\nBased on studies of adults, people with amnesia, and neurological research on memory, researchers have proposed several 'types' of memory (see Figure 4.14). Sensory memory (also called the sensory register) is the first stage of the memory system, and it stores sensory input in its raw form for just a few seconds; essentially long enough for the brain to register and start processing the information. Researchers have also found that young children hold sounds for a shorter duration than do older children and adults, and that this deficit is not due to attentional differences between these age groups, but reflects differences in the performance of the sensory memory system (Gomes et al., 1999).\nThe second stage of the memory system is called short-term or working memory . Working memory is the component of memory in which current conscious mental activity occurs. Working memory often requires conscious effort and adequate use of attention to function effectively. Children in this age group struggle with many aspects of attention and this greatly diminishes their ability to consciously juggle several pieces of information in memory. The capacity of working memory, that is the amount of information someone can hold in consciousness, is smaller in young children than in older children and adults. The typical adult and teenager can hold a 7-digit number active in their short-term memory. The typical 5-yearold can hold only a 4-digit number active. This means that the more complex a mental task is\n302 Image by Fabrice Florin is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n(like a word problem in math), the less efficient a younger child will be in paying attention to, and actively processing, information in order to complete the task.\nFigure 9.9 - A child thinking. 303\nThe third component in memory is long-term memory , which is also known as permanent memory. The human brain is capable of holding limitless amounts of information in long-term memory. The difficult part is actually retrieving the memories. Young children do not use strategies to try and remember information. Older children and adults learn to use different strategies to help remember information (like repeating a phone number over and over, putting their history test information into a song, or making work associations like 'her name is Shirley, I remember it that it's Shirley because she has curly hair.'\nA basic division of long-term memory is between declarative and non-declarative memory.\n- Declarative memories , sometimes referred to as explicit memories , are memories for facts or events that we can consciously recollect. Declarative memory is further divided into semantic and episodic memory.\n- o Semantic memories are memories for facts and knowledge that are not tied to a timeline,\n- o Episodic memories are tied to specific events in time.\n- Non- declarative memories , sometimes referred to as implicit memories , are typically automated skills that do not require conscious recollection.\nAutobiographical memory is our personal narrative. Adults rarely remember events from the first few years of life. In other words, we lack autobiographical memories from our experiences as an infant, toddler, and very young preschooler. Several factors contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory including brain maturation, improvements in language, opportunities to talk about experiences with parents and others, the development of theory of mind, and a representation of 'self' (Nelson & Fivush, 2004). Two-year-olds do remember fragments of personal experiences, but these are rarely coherent accounts of past events (Nelson & Ross, 1980). Between 2 and 2 1/2 years of age children can provide more information\n303 Image by Leonid Mamchenkov is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nabout past experiences. However, these recollections require considerable prodding by adults (Nelson & Fivush, 2004). Over the next few years, children will form more detailed autobiographical memories and engage in more reflection of the past."

Morra, Gobbo, Marini, and Sheese (2008) reviewed Neo-Piagetian theories, which were first presented in the 1970s, and identified how these 'new' theories combined Piagetian concepts with those found in Information Processing. Similar to Piaget's theory, Neo-Piagetian theories believe in constructivism, assume cognitive development can be separated into different stages with qualitatively different characteristics, and advocate that children's thinking becomes more complex in advanced stages. Unlike Piaget, Neo-Piagetians believe that aspects of information processing change the complexity of each stage, not logic as determined by Piaget.\nNeo-Piagetians propose that working memory capacity is affected by biological maturation, and therefore restricts young children's ability to acquire complex thinking and reasoning skills. Increases in working memory performance and cognitive skills development coincide with the timing of several neurodevelopmental processes. These include myelination, axonal and synaptic pruning, changes in cerebral metabolism, and changes in brain activity (Morra et al., 2008).\nMyelination especially occurs in waves between birth and adolescence, and the degree of myelination in particular areas explains the increasing efficiency of certain skills. Therefore, brain maturation, which occurs in spurts, affects how and when cognitive skills develop. Additionally, all Neo-Piagetian theories support that experience and learning interact with biological maturation in shaping cognitive development. 304"

This mental mind reading helps humans to understand and predict the reactions of others, thus playing a crucial role in social development. One common method for determining if a child has reached this mental milestone is the false belief task, described below.\nThe research began with a clever experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether children can pass a false-belief test (see Figure 4.17). The child is shown a picture story of Sally, who puts her ball in a basket and leaves the room. While Sally is out of the room, Anne comes along and takes the ball from the basket and puts it inside a box. The child is then asked where Sally thinks the ball is located when she comes back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box or the basket? The right answer is that she will look in the basket, because that's where she put it and thinks it is, but we have to infer this false belief against our own better knowledge that the ball is in the box.\nFigure 9.12 - A basket. 307\n305\nImage by Eglin Air Force Base is in the public domain\n306\nImage is in the public domain\n307\nImage is licensed under CC0\n308\nImage is in the public domain\nFigure 9.13 - A box. 308\nThis is very difficult for children before the age of four because of the cognitive effort it takes. Three-year-olds have difficulty distinguishing between what they once thought was true and what they now know to be true. They feel confident that what they know now is what they have always known (Birch & Bloom, 2003). Even adults need to think through this task (Epley, Morewedge, & Keysar, 2004).\nTo be successful at solving this type of task the child must separate what he or she 'knows' to be true from what someone else might 'think' is true. Children who are egocentric cannot see things from another person's point of view, and so they will assume everyone knows what they know. Consequently, before age four children are rarely successful at solving such a task (Wellman, Cross & Watson, 2001).\nResearchers examining the development of theory of mind have been concerned by the overemphasis on the mastery of false belief as the primary measure of whether a child has attained theory of mind. Wellman and his colleagues (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu & Liu, 2006) suggest that theory of mind is comprised of several components, each with its own developmental timeline (see Table 4.2).\nTwo-year-olds understand the diversity of desires, yet as noted earlier it is not until age four or five that children grasp false belief, and often not until middle childhood do they understand that people may hide how they really feel. In part, because children in early childhood have difficulty hiding how they really feel."

Yet, Chinese and Iranian preschoolers acquire knowledge access before diverse beliefs (Shahaeian, Peterson, Slaughter & Wellman, 2011). Shahaeian and colleagues suggested that cultural differences in childrearing may account for this reversal. Parents in collectivistic cultures, such as China and Iran, emphasize conformity to the family and cultural values, greater respect for elders, and the acquisition of knowledge and academic skills more than they do autonomy and social skills (Frank, Plunkett & Otten, 2010). This could reduce the degree of familial conflict of opinions expressed in the family. In contrast, individualistic cultures encourage children to think for themselves and assert their own opinion, and this could increase the risk of conflict in beliefs being expressed by family members.\nFigure 9.14 - A family from a non-Western culture. 309\nAs a result, children in individualistic cultures would acquire insight into the question of diversity of belief earlier, while children in collectivistic cultures would acquire knowledge access earlier in the sequence. The role of conflict in aiding the development of theory of mind may account for the earlier age of onset of an understanding of false belief in children with siblings, especially older siblings (McAlister & Petersen, 2007; Perner, Ruffman & Leekman, 1994).\nThis awareness of the existence of theory of mind is part of social intelligence, such as recognizing that others can think differently about situations. It helps us to be self-conscious or aware that others can think of us in different ways and it helps us to be able to be understanding or be empathetic toward others. Moreover, this mind-reading ability helps us to anticipate and predict people's actions. The awareness of the mental states of others is important for communication and social skills. 310"

However, universal preschool covering all four-year-olds in the country would require significant funding through tax dollars. Further, how effective preschools are in preparing all children for elementary school, and what constitutes high-quality early childhood education have been debated.\nTo set criteria for designation as a high-quality preschool, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) identifies 10 standards (NAEYC, 2016). These include:\n- Positive relationships among all children and adults are promoted.\n- A curriculum that supports learning and development in social, emotional, physical, language, and cognitive areas.\n- Teaching approaches that are developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate.\n- Assessment of children's progress to provide information on learning and development.\n- The health and nutrition of children are promoted, while they are protected from illness and injury.\n- Teachers possess the educational qualifications, knowledge, and commitment to promote children's learning.\n- Collaborative relationships with families are established and maintained.\n- Relationships with agencies and institutions in the children's communities are established to support the program's goals.\n- The indoor and outdoor physical environments are safe and well-maintained.\n- Leadership and management personnel are well qualified, effective, and maintain licensure status with the applicable state agency.\nParents should review preschool programs using the NAEYC criteria as a guide and template for asking questions that will assist them in choosing the best program for their child.\nFigure 9.16 - Children making crafts at preschool. 314\nSelecting the right preschool is difficult because there are so many types of preschools available.

However, concerns about the effectiveness of Head Start have been ongoing since the program began. Armor (2015) reviewed existing research on Head Start and found there were no lasting gains, and the average child in Head Start had not learned more than children who did not receive preschool education.\nFigure 9.17 - A photograph from when Head Start began. 316\nA recent report dated July 2015 evaluating the effectiveness of Head Start comes from the What Works Clearinghouse. The What Works Clearinghouse identifies research that provides reliable evidence of the effectiveness of programs and practices in education and is managed by the Institute of Education Services for the United States Department of Education. After reviewing 90 studies on the effectiveness of Head Start, only one study was deemed scientifically acceptable and this study showed disappointing results (Barshay, 2015). This study showed that 3- and 4year-old children in Head Start received 'potentially positive effects' on general reading achievement, but no noticeable effects on math achievement and social-emotional development.\nNonexperimental designs are a significant problem in determining the effectiveness of Head Start programs because a control group is needed to show group differences that would demonstrate educational benefits. Because of ethical reasons, low-income children are usually provided with some type of pre-school programming in an alternative setting. Additionally, Head Start programs are different depending on the location, and these differences include the length of the day or qualification of the teachers. Lastly, testing young children is difficult and strongly dependent on their language skills and comfort level with an evaluator (Barshay, 2015). 317"

Ramani and\n316 Image by Children's Bureau Centennial\n317 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nSiegler (2008) hypothesized that this difference is due to the children in middle- and upperincome families engaging more frequently in numerical activities, for example playing numerical board games such as Chutes and Ladders. Chutes and Ladders is a game with a number in each square; children start at the number one and spin a spinner or throw a dice to determine how far to move their token. Playing this game seemed likely to teach children about numbers, because in it, larger numbers are associated with greater values on a variety of dimensions. In particular, the higher the number that a child's token reaches, the greater the distance the token will have traveled from the starting point, the greater the number of physical movements the child will have made in moving the token from one square to another, the greater the number of number-words the child will have said and heard, and the more time will have passed since the beginning of the game. These spatial, kinesthetic, verbal, and timebased cues provide a broad-based, multisensory foundation for knowledge of numerical magnitudes (the sizes of numbers), a type of knowledge that is closely related to mathematics achievement test scores (Booth & Siegler, 2006).\nPlaying this numerical board game for roughly 1 hour, distributed over a 2-week period, improved low-income children's knowledge of numerical magnitudes, ability to read printed numbers, and skill at learning novel arithmetic problems. The gains lasted for months after the game-playing experience (Ramani & Siegler, 2008; Siegler & Ramani, 2009). An advantage of this type of educational intervention is that it has minimal if any cost-a parent could just draw a game on a piece of paper."

Kindergartners' performance on these tasks is the strongest predictor of reading achievement in third and fourth grade, even stronger than IQ or social class background (Nation, 2008).

Also, research suggests that there is a much higher concordance rate among monozygotic (identical) twins compared to dizygotic (fraternal) twins. It appears that there is no single gene that can account for ASD; instead, there seem to be multiple genes involved, each of which is a risk factor for part of the autism syndrome through various groups.

Of course, we do not always interpret their responses accurately so our self-concept is not simply a mirror reflection of the views of others. After forming an initial self-concept, we may use it as a mental filter screening out those responses that do not seem to fit our ideas of who we are. Some compliments may be negated, for example. The process of the looking-glass self is pronounced when we are preschoolers, or perhaps when we are in a new school or job or are taking on a new role in our personal lives and are trying to gauge our own performances.

There are two parts of the self: the 'I' which is the part of the self that is spontaneous, creative, innate, and is not concerned with how others view us and the 'me' or the social definition of who we are.\nWhen we are born, we are all 'I' and act without concern about how others view us. But the socialized self begins when we can consider how one important person views us. This initial stage is called 'taking the role of the significant other'. For example, a child may pull a cat's tail and be told by his mother, 'No! Don't do that, that's bad' while receiving a slight slap on the hand. Later, the child may mimic the same behavior toward the self and say aloud, 'No, that's bad' while patting his own hand. What has happened? The child can see himself through the eyes of the mother. As the child grows and is exposed to many situations and rules of culture, he begins to view the self in the eyes of many others through these cultural norms or rules. This is referred to as 'taking the role of the generalized other' and results in a sense of self with many dimensions. The child comes to have a sense of self as a student, as a friend, as a son, and so on."

    "context_enriched_content": "Self-Esteem\nEarly childhood is a time of forming an initial sense of self. Self-concept is our self-description according to various categories, such as our external and internal qualities. In contrast, selfesteem is an evaluative judgment about who we are. The emergence of cognitive skills in this age group results in improved perceptions of the self, but when researchers ask young children to describe themselves, their descriptions tend to include physical descriptors, preferred activities, and favorite possessions. Thus, the self-description of a 3-year-old might be a 3-yearold girl with red hair, who likes to play with blocks. However, even children as young as three know there is more to themselves than these external characteristics.\nHarter and Pike (1984) challenged the method of measuring personality with an open-ended question as they felt that language limitations were hindering the ability of young children to express their self-knowledge. They suggested a change to the method of measuring selfconcept in young children, whereby researchers provide statements that ask whether something is true of the child (e.g., 'I like to boss people around', 'I am grumpy most of the time'). They discovered that in early childhood, children answer these statements in an internally consistent manner, especially after the age of four (Goodvin, Meyer, Thompson & Hayes, 2008) and often give similar responses to what others (parents and teachers) say about the child (Brown, Mangelsdorf, Agathen, & Ho, 2008; Colwell & Lindsey, 2003). This shows why it is important to be careful in labeling a child. By saying in front of a child, 'sorry, she is shy' you might actually  be causing her to be more 'shy.'\nFigure 10.2 - Young children don't always feel good about themselves. 328\nYoung children tend to have a generally positive self-image. This optimism is often the result of a lack of social comparison when making self-evaluations (Ruble, Boggiano, Feldman, & Loeble, 1980), and with a comparison between what the child once could do to what they can do now (Kemple, 1995). However, this does not mean that preschool children are exempt from negative self-evaluations. Preschool children with insecure attachments to their caregivers tend to have lower self-esteem at age four (Goodvin et al., 2008). Maternal negative affect (emotional state) was also found by Goodwin and her colleagues to produce more negative self-evaluations in preschool children.\n328"

    "context_enriched_content": "Self-Control\nSelf-control is not a single phenomenon but is multi-faceted. It includes response initiation, the ability to not initiate a behavior before you have evaluated all of the information, response inhibition, the ability to stop a behavior that has already begun, and delayed gratification , the ability to hold out for a larger reward by forgoing a smaller immediate reward (Dougherty, Marsh, Mathias, & Swann, 2005). It is in early childhood that we see the start of self-control, a process that takes many years to fully develop. In the now-classic 'Marshmallow Test' (Mischel, Ebbesen, & Zeiss, 1972) children are confronted with the choice of a small immediate reward (a marshmallow) and a larger delayed reward (more marshmallows). Walter Mischel and his colleagues over the years have found that the ability to delay gratification at the age of four predicted better academic performance and health later in life (Mischel, et al., 2011). Selfcontrol is related to executive function. Executive function involves cognitive skills of being able to plan, remember, focus on what is important, and manage distractions, disappointments, and frustrations. As executive function improves, children become less impulsive (Traverso, Viterbori, & Usai, 2015). 329"

'These are our abilities to develop awareness of our own thinking processes they influence how effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities.'\nIn a study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young preschoolers, she found that children with greater self-control solved problems quicker when exploring an unfamiliar set-up requiring scientific reasoning, regardless of their IQ. 'This sort of evidence makes us think that giving children the chance to play will make them more successful and creative problemsolvers in the long run.'\nIf playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say the researchers, it could be extremely significant for educational practices because the ability to self-regulate is a key predictor of academic performance.\nGibson adds: 'Playful behavior is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional development. In my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can give us important clues about their well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.' 330\n329 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n330\nPlay's the Thing by the University of Cambridge is licensed under CC BY 4.0"

If the child is placed in an environment where he/she can explore, make decisions, and initiate activities, they will develop initiative. On the other hand, if the child is put in an environment where initiation is repressed through criticism and control, he/she will develop a sense of guilt.\nFigure 10.3 - Children playing in the sand. 331\nThe trust and autonomy of previous stages develop into a desire to take initiative or to think of ideas and initiative action. Children may want to build a fort with the cushions from the living room couch or open a lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their stuffed animals and issue tickets to those who want to come. Or they may just want to get themselves ready for bed without any assistance. To reinforce taking initiative, caregivers should offer encouragement and focus on the child's efforts and avoid being critical of messes or mistakes.

According to Freud, during the phallic stage, the child develops an attraction to the opposite-sex parent but after recognizing that they cannot after the same-sex parent. The child develops his or her sense of masculinity or femininity from this resolution. And, according to Freud, a person who does not exhibit gender-appropriate behavior, such as a woman who competes with men for jobs or a man who lacks self-assurance and dominance, has not successfully completed this stage of development. Consequently, such a person continues to struggle with his or her own gender identity. This model assumes that early childhood experiences result in lifelong gender self-concepts. However, gender socialization is a process that continues throughout life. Children, teens, and adults refine and can modify their sense of self based on gender.\nFigure 10.4 - A boy showing independence and confidence. 333\nFigure 10.5 - A girl showing dependence and comfort within a relationship. 334"

    "context_enriched_content": "Learning through Reinforcement and Modeling\nLearning theorists suggest that gender role socialization is a result of the ways in which parents, teachers, friends, schools, religious institutions, media, and others send messages about what is acceptable or desirable behavior as males or females. This socialization begins early-in fact, it may even begin the moment a parent learns that a child is on the way. Knowing the sex of the child can conjure up images of the child's behavior, appearance, and potential on the part of a parent. And this stereotyping continues to guide perception through life. Consider parents of newborns, shown a 7-pound, 20-inch baby, wrapped in blue (a color designating males)\n333 Image by Adam Jones is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n334 Image by Free-Photos on Pixabay\ndescribe the child as tough, strong, and angry when crying. Shown the same infant in pink (a color used in the United States for baby girls), these parents are likely to describe the baby as pretty, delicate, and frustrated when crying. (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987). Female infants are held more, talked to more frequently, and given direct eye contact, while male infants play is often mediated through a toy or activity.\nSons are given tasks that take them outside the house and that have to be performed only on occasion while girls are more likely to be given chores inside the home such as cleaning or cooking that is performed daily. Sons are encouraged to think for themselves when they encounter problems and daughters are more likely to be given assistance even when they are working on an answer. This impatience is reflected in teachers waiting less time when asking a female student for an answer than when asking for a reply from a male student (Sadker and Sadker, 1994). Girls are given the message from teachers that they must try harder and endure to succeed while boys' successes are attributed to their intelligence. Of course, the stereotypes of advisors can also influence which kinds of courses or vocational choices girls and boys are encouraged to make.\nFriends discuss what is acceptable for boys and girls and popularity may be based on modeling what is considered ideal behavior or looks for the sexes. Girls tend to tell one another secrets to validate others as best friends while boys compete for position by emphasizing their knowledge, strength, or accomplishments. This focus on accomplishments can even give rise to exaggerating accomplishments in boys, but girls are discouraged from showing off and may learn to minimize their accomplishments as a result.\nGender messages abound in our environment. But does this mean that each of us receives and interprets these messages in the same way? Probably not. In addition to being recipients of these cultural expectations, we are individuals who also modify these roles (Kimmel, 2008). Based on what young children learn about gender from parents, peers, and those who they observe in society, children develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with maleness or femaleness which is referred to as gender schemas .\nHow much does gender matter? In the United States, gender differences are found in school experiences, social interactions, and media messages. (Even into college and professional school, girls are less vocal in the classrooms and much more at risk for sexual harassment from teachers, coaches, classmates, and professors.) The stereotypes that boys should be strong, forceful, active, dominant, and rational and that girls should be pretty, subordinate, unintelligent, emotional, and gabby are portrayed in children's toys, books, commercials, video games, movies, television shows and music.\nFigure 10.6 - Store shelves filled with pink and purple colors and girls' toys. 335\nFigure 10.7 - Store shelves filled with primary colors and boys' toys. 336\nIn adulthood, these differences are reflected in income gaps between men and women where women working full-time earn about 74 percent the income of men, in higher rates of women suffering rape and domestic violence, higher rates of eating disorders for females, and in higher rates of violent death for men in young adulthood. Each of these differences will be explored further in subsequent chapters. 337"

Although prevalence rates are low, at approximately 0.3 percent of the United States population (Russo, 2016), children who later identified as transgender, often stated that they were the opposite gender as soon as they began talking. Comments such as stating they prefer the toys, clothing, and anatomy of the opposite sex, while rejecting the toys, clothing, and anatomy of their assigned sex are criteria for a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria in children. Certainly, many young children do not conform to the gender roles modeled by the culture and even push back against assigned roles. However, they do not experience discomfort regarding their gender identity and would not be identified with Gender Dysphoria.

    "context_enriched_content": "Family Life\nRelationships between parents and children continue to play a significant role in children's development during early childhood. We will explore two models of parenting styles.  Keep in mind that most parents do not follow any model completely. Real people tend to fall somewhere in between these styles. And sometimes parenting styles change from one child to the next or in times when the parent has more or less time and energy for parenting. Parenting styles can also be affected by concerns the parent has in other areas of his or her life. For example, parenting styles tend to become more authoritarian when parents are tired and perhaps more authoritative when they are more energetic. Sometimes parents seem to change their parenting approach when others are around, maybe because they become more selfconscious as parents or are concerned with giving others the impression that they are a 'tough' parent or an 'easy-going' parent. And of course, parenting styles may reflect the type of parenting someone saw modeled while growing up.\nFigure 10.8 - A family playing outside together. 339"

The first, authoritarian , is the traditional model of parenting in which parents make the rules and children are expected to be obedient. Baumrind suggests that authoritarian parents tend to place maturity demands on their children that are unreasonably high and tend to be aloof and distant. Consequently, children reared in this way may fear rather than respect their parents and, because their parents do not allow discussion, may take out their frustrations on safer targets-perhaps as bullies toward peers.\nPermissive parenting involves holding expectations of children that are below what could be reasonably expected from them. Children are allowed to make their own rules and determine their own activities. Parents are warm and communicative, but provide little structure for their\n339 Image by Air Force Medical Service is in the public domain\nchildren. Children fail to learn self-discipline and may feel somewhat insecure because they do not know the limits.\nAuthoritative parenting involves being appropriately strict, reasonable, and affectionate. Parents allow negotiation where appropriate and discipline matches the severity of the offense. A popular parenting program that is offered in many school districts is called 'Love and Logic' and reflects the authoritative or democratic style of parenting just described.\nUninvolved parents (also referred to as rejecting/neglecting) are disengaged from their children.  They do not make demands on their children and are non-responsive.  These children can suffer in school and in their relationships with their peers (Gecas & Self, 1991)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Lemasters and Defrain\nLemasters and Defrain (1989) offer another model of parenting. This model is interesting because it looks more closely at the motivations of the parent and suggests that parenting styles are often designed to meet the psychological needs of the parent rather than the developmental needs of the child.\nThe martyr is a parent who will do anything for the child; even tasks that the child should do for himself or herself. All of the good deeds performed for the child, in the name of being a 'good parent', may be used later should the parent want to gain compliance from the child. If a child goes against the parent's wishes, the parent can remind the child of all of the times the parent helped the child and evoke a feeling of guilt so that the child will do what the parent wants. The child learns to be dependent and manipulative as a result.\nThe pal is like the permissive parent described previously in Baumrind's model. The pal wants to be the child's friend. Perhaps the parent is lonely or perhaps the parent is trying to win a popularity contest against an ex-spouse. Pals let children do what they want and focus mostly on being entertaining and fun and set few limitations. Consequently, the child may have little self-discipline and may try to test limits with others.\nThe police officer/drill sergeant style of parenting is similar to the authoritarian parent described by Baumrind. The parent focuses primarily on making sure that the child is obedient and that the parent has full control of the child. Sometimes this can be taken to an extreme by giving the child tasks that are really designed to check on their level of obedience. For example, the parent may require that the child fold the clothes and place items back in the drawer in a particular way. If not, the child might be scolded or punished for not doing things 'right'. This type of parent has a very difficult time allowing the child to grow and learn to make decisions independently. And the child may have a lot of resentment toward the parent that is displaced on others.\nThe teacher-counselor parent is one who pays a lot of attention to expert advice on parenting and who believes that as long as all of the steps are followed, the parent can rear a perfect\nchild. 'What's wrong with that?' you might ask. There are two major problems with this approach. First, the parent is taking all of the responsibility for the child's behavior-at least indirectly. If the child has difficulty, the parent feels responsible and thinks that the solution lies in reading more advice and trying more diligently to follow that advice.\nParents can certainly influence children, but thinking that the parent is fully responsible for the child's outcome is misguided. A parent can only do so much and can never have full control over the child. Another problem with this approach is that the child may get an unrealistic sense of the world and what can be expected from others. For example, if a teacher-counselor parent decides to help the child build self-esteem and has read that telling the child how special he or she is or how important it is to compliment the child on a job well done, the parent may convey the message that everything the child does is exceptional or extraordinary. A child may come to expect that all of his efforts warrant praise and in the real world, this is not something one can expect. Perhaps children get more of a sense of pride from assessing their own performance than from having others praise their efforts.\nFigure 10.9 - A father interacting with his son who is drawing a picture. He could be portraying the style of teacher-counselor or athletic coach 340\nSo what is left? Lemasters and Defrain (1989) suggest that the athletic coach style of parenting is best. Before you draw conclusions here, set aside any negative experiences you may have had with coaches in the past. The principles of coaching are what are important to Lemasters and Defrain. A coach helps players form strategies, supports their efforts, gives feedback on what went right and what went wrong, and stands at the sideline while the players perform. Coaches and referees make sure that the rules of the game are followed and that all players adhere to those rules. Similarly, the athletic coach as parent helps the child understand what needs to happen in certain situations whether in friendships, school, or home life, and encourages and advises the child about how to manage these situations. The parent does not intervene or do things for the child. Their role is to provide guidance while the child learns firsthand how to handle these situations. And the rules for behavior are consistent and\n340 Image by U.S. Air Forces Central Command is in the public domain"

Rather than, 'You know good and well that we always eat at six. If you expect me to get up and make something for you now, you have got another thing coming! Just who do you think you are showing up late and looking for food? You're grounded until further notice!'\nThe most important thing to remember about parenting is that you can be a better, more objective parent when you are directing your actions toward the child's needs and while considering what they can reasonably be expected to do at their stage of development. Parenting is more difficult when you are tired and have psychological needs that interfere with the relationship. Some of the best advice for parents is to try not to take the child's actions personally and be as objective as possible."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cultural Influences on Parenting Styles\nThe impact of class and culture cannot be ignored when examining parenting styles. The two models of parenting described above assume that authoritative and athletic coaching styles are best because they are designed to help the parent raise a child who is independent, self-reliant, and responsible. These are qualities favored in 'individualistic' cultures such as the United States, particularly by the white middle class. African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents tend to be more authoritarian than non-Hispanic whites.\nFigure 10.10 - A family from a collectivistic culture. 341\nIn 'collectivistic' cultures such as China or Korea, being obedient and compliant are favored behaviors. Authoritarian parenting has been used historically and reflects the cultural need for children to do as they are told. In societies where family members' cooperation is necessary for\n341 Image by the National Cancer Institute is in the public domain\nsurvival, as in the case of raising crops, rearing children who are independent and who strive to be on their own makes no sense. But in an economy based on being mobile in order to find jobs and where one's earnings are based on education, raising a child to be independent is very important.\nWorking-class parents are more likely than middle-class parents to focus on obedience and honesty when raising their children. In a classic study on social class and parenting styles called Class and Conformity, Kohn (1977) explains that parents tend to emphasize qualities that are needed for their own survival when parenting their children. Working-class parents are rewarded for being obedient, reliable, and honest in their jobs. They are not paid to be independent or to question the management; rather, they move up and are considered good employees if they show up on time, do their work as they are told, and can be counted on by their employers. Consequently, these parents reward honesty and obedience in their children.\nMiddle-class parents who work as professionals are rewarded for taking initiative, being selfdirected, and assertive in their jobs. They are required to get the job done without being told exactly what to do. They are asked to be innovative and to work independently. These parents encourage their children to have those qualities as well by rewarding independence and selfreliance. Parenting styles can reflect many elements of culture. 342"

Just how effective is spanking, however, and are there any negative consequences? After reviewing the research, Smith (2012) states 'many studies have shown that physical punishment, including spanking, hitting and other means of causing pain, can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behavior, physical injury and mental health problems for children' (p. 60).\nby Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n343\nImage on Pexels\nGershoff, (2008) reviewed decades of research and recommended that parents and caregivers make every effort to avoid physical punishment and called for the banning of physical discipline in all U.S. schools. Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor (2016) completed another metanalysis that looked at research over 160,927 children. They found an increased risk for negative outcomes for children who are spanked and that effects of spanking were similar to that of physical abuse.\nIn a longitudinal study that followed more than 1500 families from 20 U.S. cities, parents' reports of spanking were assessed at ages three and five (MacKenzie, Nicklas, Waldfogel, & Brooks-Gunn, 2013). Measures of externalizing behavior (aggression and rule-breaking) and receptive vocabulary were assessed at age nine.\nOverall, 57% of mothers and 40% of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age 3, and 52% of mothers and 33% of fathers engaged in spanking at age 5. Maternal spanking at age 5, even at low levels, was associated with higher levels of aggression at age 9, even after an array of risks and earlier child behavior were controlled for. Father's high-frequency spanking at age 5 was associated with lower child receptive vocabulary scores at age 9. This study revealed the negative cognitive effects of spanking in addition to the increase in aggressive behavior.\nInternationally, physical discipline is increasingly being viewed as a violation of children's human rights. Thirty countries have banned the use of physical punishment, and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (2014) called physical punishment 'legalized violence against children' and advocated that physical punishment be eliminated in all settings.\nAlternatives to spanking are advocated by child development specialists and include:\n- Praising and modeling appropriate behavior\n- Providing time-outs for inappropriate behavior\n- Giving choices\n- Helping the child identify emotions and learning to calm down\n- Ignoring small annoyances\n- Withdrawing privileges"

In peer relationships, children learn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other children. They learn skills for managing conflict, such as turn-taking, compromise, and bargaining. Play also involves the mutual, sometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions, and understanding. For example, as preschoolers engage in pretend play they create narratives together, choose roles, and collaborate to act out their stories. Through these experiences, children develop friendships that provide additional sources of security and support to those provided by their parents.\nFigure 10.13 - Navigating dramatic play provides great opportunities to continue to develop social skills with same-age peers. 346\nHowever, peer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive (Rubin, Coplan, Chen, Bowker, & McDonald, 2011). Being accepted by other children is an important source of affirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can foreshadow later behavior problems (especially when children are rejected due to aggressive behavior).\nPeer relationships require developing very different social and emotional skills than those that emerge in parent-child relationships. They also illustrate the many ways that peer relationships influence the growth of personality and self-concept. 347"

    "context_enriched_content": "Play\nFreud saw play as a means for children to release pent-up emotions and to deal with emotionally distressing situations in a more secure environment. Vygotsky and Piaget saw play as a way of children developing their intellectual abilities (Dyer & Moneta, 2006). Piaget created stages of play that correspond with his stages of cognitive development. The stages are:\n346 Image by Seattle City Council is in the public domain\n347 Children's Development by Ana R. Leon is licensed under CC BY 4.0\nTable 10.2 - Piaget's Stages of Play 348\n\nFunctional Play, Description = Exploring, inspecting, and learning through repetitive physical activity.. Symbolic Play, Description = The ability to use objects, actions, or ideas to represent other objects, actions, or ideas and may include taking on roles. 349. Constructive Play, Description = Involves experimenting with objects to build things 350 ; learning things that were previously unknown with hands-on manipulations of materials.. Games with Rules, Description = Imposes rules that must be followed by everyone who is playing; the logic and order involved forms the foundations for developing game playing strategy 351\nWhile Freud, Piaget, and Vygotsky looked at play slightly differently, all three theorists saw play as providing positive outcomes for children.\nMildred Parten (1932) observed two to five-year-old children and noted six types of play. Three types she labeled as non-social (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three types were categorized as social play (parallel, associative, and cooperative). The table below describes each type of play. Younger children engage in non-social play more than those who are older; by age five associative and cooperative play are the most common forms of play (Dyer & Moneta, 2006). 352\n348 Cognitive and Social Types of Play (n.d.).

This is the least common form of play. Example: An infant kicking is feet moving his arms while being held by his mom.. Solitary Play, Description = Children play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are they engaging in similar activities as the children around them. Examples: An infant playing on a blanket with sensory rattles. Or, an older child playing the card game, solitaire.. Onlooker Play, Description = Children are observing other children playing. They may comment on the activities and even make suggestions, but will not directly join the play. Example: A child new to the class sits by the teacher and watches the other children playing 'firefighters' on the play structure. At one point she points to the water table and says 'get more water from the lake to put out the flames!'. Parallel Play, Description = Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly act with each other. Example: Two children are playing with playdough. One says 'I am making snakes!' the other child continues lumping his playdough into a large clump and says 'mine is a mountain'. Associative Play, Description = Children will interact with each other and share toys, but are not working toward a common goal. Examples: Children are playing tag where everyone is tagging and running from everyone. Or, children are adding to one common block tower, but blocks are being put on however one can stack them and one child is calling it a castle, and another says it's a Costco.. Cooperative Play, Description = Children are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on different tasks or agree on certain rules to reach that goal. Examples: An organized game of tag where one child is 'it' and everyone agreed the picnic table is 'safe'. Or everyone is riding tricycles, pretending to be Amazon delivery drivers on a route."

    "context_enriched_content": "Social Understanding\nChildren's experience of relationships at home and the peer group contributes to an expanding repertoire of social and emotional skills and also to broadened social understanding. In these relationships, children develop expectations for specific people (leading, for example, to secure or insecure attachments to parents), understanding of how to interact with adults and peers,\n353 Lifespan Development - Module 5: Early Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\nand develop a self-concept based on how others respond to them. These relationships are also significant forums for emotional development.\nRemarkably, young children begin developing social understanding very early in life. Before the end of the first year, infants are aware that other people have perceptions, feelings, and other mental states that affect their behavior, and which are different from the child's own mental states. Carefully designed experimental studies show that by late in the preschool years, young children understand that another's beliefs can be mistaken rather than correct, that memories can affect how you feel, and that one's emotions can be hidden from others (Wellman, 2011). Social understanding grows significantly as children's theory of mind develops.\nHow do these achievements in social understanding occur? One answer is that young children are remarkably sensitive observers of other people, making connections between their emotional expressions, words, and behavior to derive simple inferences about mental states (e.g., concluding, for example, that what Mommy is looking at is in her mind) (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2001). This is especially likely to occur in relationships with people whom the child knows well, consistent with the ideas of attachment theory discussed above.\nFigure 10.14 - A father speaking to his child. 354\nGrowing language skills give young children words with which to represent these mental states (e.g., 'mad,' 'wants') and talk about them with others. Thus in conversation with their parents about everyday experiences, children learn much about people's mental states from how adults talk about them ('Your sister was sad because she thought Daddy was coming home.') (Thompson, 2006b).\nDeveloping social understanding is based on children's everyday interactions with others and their careful interpretations of what they see and hear. Some scientists believe that infants are biologically prepared to perceive people in a special way, as organisms with an internal mental life, and this facilitates their interpretation of people's behavior concerning those mental states (Leslie, 1994).\n354 Image is in the public domain"

    "context_enriched_content": "Personality\nParents often scrutinize their child's preferences, characteristics, and responses for clues of a developing personality. They are quite right to do so, because temperament is a foundation for personality growth. But temperament (defined as early-emerging differences in reactivity and self-regulation) is not the whole story. Although temperament is biologically based, it interacts with the influence of experience from the moment of birth (if not before) to shape personality (Rothbart, 2011). Temperamental dispositions are affected, for example, by the support level of parental care. More generally, personality is shaped by the goodness of fit between the child's temperamental qualities and characteristics of the environment (Chess & Thomas, 1999). For example, an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her on weekend hiking and fishing trips would be a good 'fit' to her lifestyle, supporting personality growth. Personality is the result, therefore, of the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience, as is true for many other aspects of social and personality development.\nPersonality develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, & Goodvin, 2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but as brain-based capacities for self-control advance, temperamental changes in self-regulation become more apparent. So, an infant who cries frequently doesn't necessarily have a grumpy personality. With sufficient parental support and an increased sense of security, the child may develop into a content preschooler who is not likely to cry to get her needs met.\nFigure 10.15 - A girl enjoying nature. 355\nPersonality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children's developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other qualities are\n355 Image by Khanh Steven on Unsplash\nencompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even more by the child's experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the growth of individual characteristics.\nIndeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The development of personality, social and emotional competence, and conscience is influenced first by temperament but then also by having a good fit between the child's temperamental qualities and how parents and caregivers communicate and reinforce behavioral expectations.\nFigure 10.16 - This child might be experiencing a guilty conscience. 356"

    "context_enriched_content": "Childhood Stress and Development\nWhat is the impact of stress on child development?  Children experience different types of stressors. Normal, everyday stress can provide an opportunity for young children to build coping skills and poses little risk to development.  Even more long-lasting stressful events such as changing schools or losing a loved one can be managed fairly well. But children who experience toxic stress or who live in extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods of time can suffer long-lasting effects.  The structures in the midbrain or limbic system such as the hippocampus and amygdala can be vulnerable to prolonged stress during early childhood (Middlebrooks and Audage, 2008).  High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the size of the hippocampus and affect the child's memory abilities. Stress hormones can also reduce immunity to disease. The brain exposed to long periods of severe stress can develop a low threshold making the child hypersensitive to stress in the future.  However, the effects of stress can be minimized if the child has the support of caring adults. Let's take a look at childhood stressors.\n356 Image by George Hodan is in the public domain"

    "context_enriched_content": "Race/Ethnicity, ACEs, and Stress\nThe first study of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) was conducted in the mid-1990s by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Kaiser Permanente. Seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were identified: psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; violence against mother; or living with household members who were substance abusers, mentally ill or suicidal, or ever imprisoned. The number of categories individuals experienced as children was then compared to measures of adult outcomes and disease. People who had experienced four or more categories as children, compared to those who had experienced none, were 2-4 times more likely to smoke, experience sexual promiscuity and sexually transmitted diseases, and poor health in general.  They were also 4-12 times at greater risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attempts (Felitti et al., 1998). Subsequent studies have identified lower thresholds, ranging from one to three ACEs, as the tipping point at which risk increases greatly (Rutter, 1979; Mersky, Topitzes, & Reynolds, 2013).\nFigure 10.17 - Adverse Childhood Experiences lead to many on-going life problems including early death. 357\nConceptan\nSince that seminal study, researchers associated with the CDC and other institutions have surveyed increasingly diverse samples of people in the United States to gauge their level of exposure to adverse childhood experiences.  Many states collect data about ACEs annually. ACEs can cause stress reactions in children that include feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and terror. When children experience these events repeatedly or over a prolonged period, toxic levels of stress hormones can interrupt normal physical and mental development and can even change the brain's architecture. Children who experience ACEs are more likely to struggle in school and have emotional and behavioral challenges (Bethell et al., 2017).\nThere are very large disparities in the amount and ways children of different racial or ethnic groups experience ACEs. At the national level, while 60 percent of white children have had no\n357 Image is in the public domain\nACEs, this is true for only 49 percent of Hispanic children and only 39 percent of black children. Below is a chart that illustrates these inequities. Discriminatory practices in housing and employment, immigration policies, and the bias in law enforcement and sentencing decisions have left black and Hispanic children with a concentrated disadvantage leaving them disproportionately vulnerable to traumatic experiences.\nA number of researchers recommend expanding the concept of ACEs to include communitylevel stressors (Cronholm et al., 2015; Bruner, 2017). Although it would be challenging to accurately assess something with such pervasive (and historically embedded) effects, many researchers believe that the experience of racism can itself have toxic effects (Brody, et al., 2015; Huynh, et al., 2016; Wade, Rubin, & Wood, 2014)."

Then between 10 and 12 years of age, the frontal lobes become more developed and improvements in logic, planning, and memory are evident (van der Molen & Molenaar, 1994). The school-aged child is better able to plan and coordinate activity using both the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which control the development of emotions, physical abilities, and intellectual capabilities. The attention span also improves as the prefrontal cortex matures. The myelin also continues to develop and the child's reaction time improves as well. Myelination improvement is one factor responsible for these growths.\nFrom age 6 to 12, the nerve cells in the association areas of the brain, that is those areas where sensory, motor, and intellectual functioning connect, become almost completely myelinated (Johnson, 2005). This myelination contributes to increases in information processing speed and the child's reaction time. The hippocampus , which is responsible for transferring information from the short-term to long-term memory, also shows increases in myelination resulting in improvements in memory functioning (Rolls, 2000).\nFigure 11.1 - The human brain . 360\nChanges in the brain during this age enable not only physical development but also allow children to understand what others think of them and gives them a greater ability to deal socially with the positive and negative consequences of that.  Within this development period, children may struggle with mental health disorders or other health problems. As children are growing and becoming more capable, adults need to remember that children don't grow physically in isolation. The development of their bodies isn't separate from the changes that are occurring socially, emotionally, and cognitively. Awareness and understanding of their other developmental domains and needs will support the child during these changes. 361"

Physical growth rates are generally slow and steady during these years. However, growth spurts do occur during middle to late childhood (Spreen, Riser, & Edgell, 1995). Typically, a child will gain about 5-7 pounds a year and grow about 2 inches per year. They also tend to slim down and gain muscle strength. As bones lengthen and broaden and muscles strengthen, many children want to engage in strenuous physical activity and can participate for longer periods of time. Also, the rate of growth for the extremities is faster than for the trunk, which results in more adult-like proportions. Long-bone growth stretches muscles and ligaments, which results in many children experiencing growing pains, at night, in particular. 362\nChildren between ages 6 and 9, show significant improvement in their abilities to perform motor skills.

All of these choices impact health, with shortand long-term consequences. Possible effects in the short-term include excess weight gain and constipation.

Parents should offer nutritious desserts, such as fresh fruits, instead of calorie-laden cookies, cakes, salty snacks, and ice cream.  Studies show that children who eat family meals frequently consume more nutritious foods. 370"

Even with the wealth of food in North America, many children grow up malnourished, or even hungry.\nMillions of children grow up in food-insecure households that do not have consistent access to adequate, nutritious foods. They may not have enough food, or may have some foods that are not providing all the nutrients they need.  Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure households with greater access to nutritious meals. 372"

In the United States, more than thirty-one million children from low-income families are given meals provided by the National School Lunch Program. This federally funded program offers low-cost or free breakfast, snacks, and lunches to school facilities. School districts that take part receive subsidies from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for every meal they serve that must meet the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nKnowing that many children in the United States buy or receive free lunches in the school cafeteria, it might be worthwhile to look at the nutritional content of school lunches.

This meal is also in compliance with Federal Nutrition Guidelines but has about 300 fewer calories than the menu in Texas. This is a big difference in calories and nutritional value of these prepared lunches that are chosen and approved of by officials on behalf of children in these districts.\nFigure 11.5 - Children eating lunch together at school. 374\nHealthy School Lunch Campaigns help to promote children's health. This is done by educating government officials, school officials, food-service workers, and parents and is sponsored by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. They educate and encourage schools to offer low-fat, cholesterol-free options in school cafeterias and vending machines and work to improve the food served to children at school. Unfortunately, many school districts in the nation allow students to purchase chips, cookies, and ice cream along with their meals.  These districts rely on the sale of these items in the lunchrooms to earn additional revenues. Not only are they making money off of children and families with junk food, they are also adding additional empty calories to their daily intake.  These districts need to look at the menus and determine the rationale for offering additional snacks and desserts for children at their schools. Whether children receive free lunches, buy their own, or bring their lunch from home, quality nutrition is what is best for these growing bodies and minds."

A food intolerance is marked by unpleasant symptoms that occur after consuming certain foods. Lactose intolerance, though rare in very young children, is one example. Children who suffer from this condition experience an adverse reaction to the lactose in milk products. It is a result of the small intestine's inability to produce enough of the enzyme lactase. Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually affect the gastrointestinal tract and can include bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods that trigger the reaction. 378"

Katz (2015) referred to this as ' oblivobesity '. Oude Luttikhuis, Stolk, and Sauer (2010) surveyed 439 parents and found that 75% of parents of overweight children said the child had a normal weight and 50% of parents of obese children said the child had a normal weight. If parents cannot identify if their children are overweight they will not be able to intervene and assist their children with proper weight management.\nAn added concern is that the children themselves are not accurately identifying if they are overweight. In a United States sample of 8-15-year-olds, more than 80% of overweight boys and 70% of overweight girls misperceived their weight as normal (Sarafrazi, Hughes, & Borrud, 2014). Also noted was that as the socioeconomic status of the children rose, the frequency of these misconceptions decreased.

    "context_enriched_content": "Results of Childhood Obesity\nChildren who are overweight tend to be rejected, ridiculed, teased, and bullied by others (Stopbullying.gov, 2016). This can certainly be damaging to their self-image and popularity. Obese children run the risk of suffering orthopedic problems such as knee injuries, and they have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in adulthood (Lu, 2016). It is hard for a child who is obese to become a non-obese adult.\nExcess weight and obesity in children are associated with a variety of medical conditions including high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, inflammation, depression, and lower academic achievement (Lu, 2016).  Being overweight has also been linked to impaired brain functioning, which includes deficits in executive functioning, working memory, mental flexibility, and decision making (Liang, Matheson, Kaye, & Boutelle, 2014). Children who ate more saturated\n380 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nfats performed worse on relational memory tasks, while eating a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids promoted relational memory skills (Davidson, 2014). Using animal studies, Davidson et al. (2013) found that large amounts of processed sugars and saturated fat weakened the bloodbrain barrier, especially in the hippocampus. This can make the brain more vulnerable to harmful substances that can impair its functioning. Another important executive functioning skill is controlling impulses and delaying gratification. Children who are overweight show less inhibitory control than normal-weight children, which may make it more difficult for them to avoid unhealthy foods (Lu, 2016). Overall, being overweight as a child increases the risk of cognitive decline through time.\nBehavioral interventions, including training children to overcome impulsive behavior, are being researched to help overweight children (Lu, 2016). Practicing inhibition has been shown to strengthen the ability to resist unhealthy foods. Parents can help their overweight children the best when they are warm and supportive without using shame or guilt. They can also help them make correct food choices and praising their efforts (Liang, et al., 2014). Research also shows that exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can help improve cognitive functioning in overweight children (Lu, 2016). Parents should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to avoid the development of any obsession about dieting that can lead to eating disorders. Instead, focusing on helping children to make healthy food choices and increase physical activity will help prevent childhood obesity. 381"

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7 million of these people are children.\nTo understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances.  When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual.\n389 Diabetes by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is in the public domain Preventing Type 2 Diabetes - Steps Toward a Healthier Life by the National Institutes of Health is in the public domain\n390\nImage by the U.S. Army is in the public domain\nMucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.

Figure C shows a cross-section of an airway during asthma symptoms. 391\nSometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine.

Even when a child feels fine, they still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. Weather, environmental toxins, and having a cold can make symptoms worse, and make asthma a common reason for why children miss school."

Now think about what the impact of stress may have on a child and their development?\nChildren experience stress and different types of stressors differently. Not all stress is bad. Normal, everyday stress can help children and adults be productive, and can provide an opportunity for children to build coping skills. Even more long-lasting stressful events such as changing schools or losing a loved one can be managed fairly well. But children who experience toxic stress or who live in extremely stressful situations of abuse over long periods of time can suffer long-lasting effects.  High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can reduce the size of the hippocampus and affect the child's memory abilities.  Stress hormones can also reduce immunity to disease.

If a child is showing a need, they should be assessed by a qualified professional who would make a recommendation or diagnosis of the child and indicate the type of instruction, resources, accommodations, and support that they should receive.\nIdeally, a proper diagnosis or label is extremely beneficial for children who have educational, social, emotional, or developmental needs. Once their difficulty, disorder, or disability is labeled then the child may receive the help they need from parents, educators, and any other professionals who will work as a team to meet the student's individual goals and needs.\nHowever, it's important to consider that children who are misdiagnosed or labeled without proper support and accommodations will have negative consequences. A label can influence the child's self-concept. For example, if a child is misdiagnosed as having a learning disability, the child, teachers, and family member interpret their actions through the lens of that label. Labels are powerful and can be good for the child or they can be detrimental all depending on the accuracy of the label and if effective interventions are applied.\nA team of people who include parents, teachers, and any other support staff will look at the child's evaluation assessment and develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP). The team will discuss the diagnosis, recommendations, and the accommodations or help and decisions will be made regarding what is best for the child. This is a time when parents or caregivers decide if they would like to follow this plan or they can dispute any part of the process. During an IEP, the team can voice concerns and questions. Most parents feel empowered when they leave these meetings. They feel as if they are a part of the team and that they know what, when, why, and how their child will be helped."

For example, toddlers are often very distressed about being away from their parents, even if they are safe and cared for. Although fears and worries are typical in children, persistent or extreme forms of fear and sadness feelings could be due to anxiety or depression. Because the symptoms primarily involve thoughts and feelings, they are called internalizing disorders .\nFigure 11.17 - An anxious child. 398\nWhen children do not outgrow the fears and worries that are typical in young children, or when there are so many fears and worries that interfere with school, home, or play activities, the child may be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Examples of different types of anxiety disorders include:\n- Being very afraid when away from parents (separation anxiety)\n- Having extreme fear about a specific thing or situation, such as dogs, insects, or going to the doctor (phobias)\n- Being very afraid of school and other places where there are people (social anxiety)\n- Being very worried about the future and bad things happening (general anxiety)\n- Having repeated episodes of sudden, unexpected, intense fear that come with symptoms like heart pounding, having trouble breathing, or feeling dizzy, shaky, or sweaty (panic disorder)\nAnxiety may present as fear or worry, but can also make children irritable and angry. Anxiety symptoms can also include trouble sleeping, as well as physical symptoms like fatigue, headaches, or stomachaches.

While the majority of children will not develop PTSD after a trauma, best estimates from the literature are that around a third of them will, higher than adult estimates. Some reasons for this could include more limited knowledge about the world, differential coping mechanisms employed, and the fact that children's reactions to trauma are often highly influenced by how their parents and caregivers react.\nThe impact of PTSD on children weeks after a trauma, show that up to 90% of children may experience heightened physiological arousal, diffuse anxiety, survivor guilt, and emotional liability. These are all normal reactions and should be understood as such (similar things are seen in adults.  Those children still having these symptoms three or four months after a disaster, however, may need further assessment.  For children, warning signs of problematic adjustment include: repetitious play reenacting a part of the disaster; preoccupation with danger or expressed concerns about safety; sleep disturbances and irritability; anger outbursts or aggressiveness; excessive worry about family or friends; school avoidance, particularly involving somatic complaints; behaviors characteristic of younger children; and changes in personality, withdrawal, and loss of interest in activities. 399"

For almost all people with OCD, being exposed to a certain stimulus (internal or external) will then trigger an upsetting or anxietycausing obsession, which can only be relieved by doing a compulsion. For example, a person touches a doorknob in a public building, which causes an obsessive thought that they will get sick from the germs, which can only be relieved by compulsively washing their hands to an excessive degree. 400 Tourette's syndrome is related strongly to this disorder.\n399 Abnormal Psychology by Lumen Learning references Abnormal Psychology: An e-text! by Dr. Caleb Lack, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA\n400 Disease Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles by Judy Baker, Ph.D. is licensed under CC BY-SA"

However, when children lose interest in things they used to enjoy and feel persistent sadness and hopelessness, they may be diagnosed with depression.\nFigure 11.18 - Persistent sadness is a symptom of depression. 401\nSymptoms may be slightly different from the typical adult symptoms of depression. Children who are depressed may complain of feeling sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent or caregiver, feel unloved, hopelessness about the future, or worry excessively that a parent may die. Older children and teens may sulk, get into trouble at school, be negative or grouchy, are irritable, indecisive, have trouble concentrating, or feel misunderstood.\nBecause normal behaviors vary from one childhood stage to another, it can be difficult to tell whether a child who shows changes in behavior is just going through a temporary 'phase' or is suffering from depression. With medication, psychotherapy, or both, most youth with depression can be effectively treated. Youth are more likely to respond to treatment if they receive it early in the course of their illness. 402\n401 Image is in the public domain\n402 Educational Psychology by Kelvin Seifert is licensed under CC BY 3.0\nDisease Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles by Judy Baker, Ph.D. is licensed under CC BY-SA"

Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to be a 'developmental disorder' because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ), a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association used to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD have:\n- Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people\n- Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors\n- Symptoms that hurt the person's ability to function properly in school, work, and other areas of life\nAutism is known as a 'spectrum' disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. In earlier editions of the DSM, Autistic disorder, Asperger's' syndrome, and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) were identified separately, but are now all included under the broader diagnosis of ASD.\nASD occurs in all ethnic, racial, and economic groups. Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments and services can improve a person's symptoms and ability to function. Early treatment for ASD is important as proper care can reduce individuals' difficulties while helping them learn new skills and make the most of their strengths.\nThe wide range of issues facing people with ASD means that there is no single best treatment for ASD. A doctor may use medication to treat some symptoms that are common with ASD. People with ASD may be referred to doctors who specialize in providing behavioral, psychological, educational, or skill-building interventions. These programs are typically highly structured and intensive and may involve parents, siblings, and other family members.\nFigure 11.19 - Rich and Nubia Quick have put their autistic 8-year-old son, Matthew, through therapy to help him open up and relate more to others.

A meta-analysis of 175 worldwide research studies found a generalized estimate of 7.2% for children 18 years or younger (Thomas et al. 2015). The 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) which interviewed parents in the United States found a prevalence rate of 9.6 percent for school-age children (Danielson et al. 2018). ADHD can cause problems in how well children do in school, in family relationships, in their ability to make and keep friends, and in how they later function in society. The CDC has labeled ADHD a serious public health problem.\nADHD is a complex disorder.  While many things contribute to an individual being diagnosed, there is an overwhelming consensus that genetics plays the leading role. It is the result of many interacting genes, and most importantly, the result of genes interacting with the environment. Other risk factors for ADHD include brain injury, low birth weight, and exposure to environmental toxins during pregnancy.\nFigure 11.20 - Brain scans of brains with and without ADHD. 404\nDiagnosis can be difficult.  The symptoms of ADHD are mostly developmentally normal behaviors that individuals do not grow out of.  Professionals use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) to guide their diagnosis. There has to be clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning. These symptoms have to be present in at least two settings (such as home, school, peer interactions) and be present before age 12.  Below is the diagnostic criteria that must be met:\n404 Image by the National Institutes of Health is in the public domain\n1.

Hyperactivity and Impulsivity: Six or more symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents 17 and older and adults; symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level:\n- Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.\n- Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.\n- Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless).\n- Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly.\n- Is often 'on the go' acting as if 'driven by a motor'.\n- Often talks excessively.\n- Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed.\n- Often has trouble waiting his/her turn.\n- Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games)\nFigure 11.21 - This child is exhibiting inattention. 405\n405 Image by Ben Paarmann is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n- ∞ Combined Presentation : if enough symptoms of both criteria inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity were present for 6 months\n- ∞ Predominantly Inattentive Presentation : if enough symptoms of inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months\n- ∞ Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation : if enough symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity, but not inattention, were present for the past 6 months."

ADHD frequently occurs along with other learning, behavior, or mood problems such as learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression.\nA variety of medications and behavioral interventions are used to treat ADHD. Some parents and therapists have tried a variety of nutritional interventions to treat ADHD. No research, however, has shown these to be effective. 406 The most widely used medications are methylphenidate (Ritalin) and other amphetamines. These drugs are stimulants that affect the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine at the synapse. Nine out of 10 children improve while taking one of these drugs, which are safe as confirmed by hundreds of careful studies.

    "context_enriched_content": "Concrete Operational Thought\nAs children continue into elementary school, they develop the ability to represent ideas and events more flexibly and logically. Their rules of thinking still seem very basic by adult standards but they allow children to solve problems more systematically than before, and therefore to be successful with many academic tasks. In the concrete operational stage, for example, a child may unconsciously follow the rule: 'If nothing is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the same.' This simple principle helps children to understand certain arithmetic tasks, such as in adding or subtracting zero from a number, as well as to do certain classroom science experiments, such as ones involving judgments of the amounts of liquids when mixed. Piaget called this period the concrete operational stage because children mentally 'operate' on concrete objects and events. 411\nFigure 12.2 - Children studying. 412\nThe concrete operational stage is defined as the third in Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This stage takes place around 7 years old to 11 years of age, and is characterized by the development of organized and rational thinking. Piaget (1954a) considered the concrete stage a major turning point in the child's cognitive development, because it marks the beginning of logical or operational thought. The child is now mature enough to use logical thought or operations (i.e. rules) but can only apply logic to physical objects (hence concrete operational). Children gain the abilities of conservation (number, area, volume, orientation) and reversibility. 413\n411 Educational Psychology by OpenStax CNX is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n412 Image is licensed under CC0\n413 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nCognitive skills that children typically master during Piaget's concrete operational stage. 414 :\nFigure 12.3 - The cognitive skills developed during the concrete operational stage. 415\nSeriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical way, is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can methodically arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children haphazardly approach a similar task. 416\nFigure 12.4 - Caption: Putting these rectangles from smallest to largest is seriation. 417\n414 Concrete Operational Stage Image by Simply Psychology is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 3.0; Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BYNC-SA 3.0\n415 Image by Ian Joslin is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n416 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n417 Image by MehreenH is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0\nClassification: As children's experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schema and can organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses.\nFigure 12.5 - This child might use classification if she sorts these toys by color. 418\nReversibility: The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to their original state . Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again. But eggs cannot be unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are reversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 - 3 = 2. Many of these cognitive skills are incorporated into the school's curriculum through mathematical problems and in worksheets about which situations are reversible or irreversible.\nFigure 12.6 - Understanding that ice cubes melt is an example of reversibility. 419\n418 Image is licensed under CC0\n419 Image by John Voo is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nConservation: An example of the preoperational child's thinking; if you were to fill a tall beaker with 8 ounces of water this child would think that it was \"more\" than a short, wide bowl filled with 8 ounces of water? Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation, which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.\nFigure 12.7 - Beakers displaying the idea of conservation. 420\nDecentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur."

For instance, the mass of an object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is broken in two. 422\nFigure 12.9 - A broken egg is still an egg. 423\nFigure 12.10 - A deflated balloon is still a balloon. 424\nFigure 12.11 - Broken chalk is still chalk. 425\nTransitivity: Being able to understand how objects are related to one another is referred to as transitivity, or transitive inference.

Gardner contends that these are also forms of intelligence. A high IQ does not always ensure success in life or necessarily indicate that a person has common sense, good interpersonal skills, or other abilities important for success. Gardner investigated intelligences by focusing on children who were talented in one or more areas. Howard Gardner (1983, 1998, 1999) suggests that there are not one, but nine domains of intelligence. Only the first three are skills that are measured by IQ tests.\n429 Image is in the public domain\nTable 12.1 - Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences 430\n\nLinguistic, Description = The ability to speak and write well. Logical- mathematical, Description = The ability to use logic and mathematical skills to solve problems. Spatial, Description = The ability to think and reason about objects in three dimensions. Musical, Description = The ability to perform and enjoy music. Kinesthetic (body), Description = The ability to move the body in sports, dance, or other physical activities. Interpersonal, Description = The ability to understand and interact effectively with others. Intrapersonal, Description = The ability to have insight into the self. Naturalistic, Description = The ability to recognize, identify, and understand animals, plants, and other living things. Existential, Description = The ability to understand and have concerns about life's larger questions, the meaning of life, and other spiritual matters\nThe concept of multiple intelligences has been influential in the field of education, and teachers have used these ideas to try to teach differently for individual students. For instance, to teach math problems to students who have particularly good kinesthetic intelligence, a teacher might encourage the students to move their bodies or hands according to the numbers. On the other hand, some have argued that these 'intelligences' sometimes seem more like 'abilities' or 'talents' rather than real intelligence. There is no clear conclusion about how many intelligences there are. Are a sense of humor, artistic skills, dramatic skills, and so forth also separate intelligences? 431"

Both changes in the brain and experience foster these abilities. In this section, we will look at how children process information, think and learn, allowing them to increase their ability to learn and remember due to an improvement in the ways they attend to, store information,  and problem solve. 432\n430 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; Table adapted from Gardner, H. (1999). Intelligence reframed: Multiple intelligences for the 21st century .

Changes in myelination and synaptic pruning in the cortex are likely behind the increase in processing speed and ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli (Kail, McBride-Chang, Ferrer, Cho, & Shu, 2013).\nFigure 12.14 - Working memory expands during middle and late childhood. 433\nAttention: As noted above, the ability to inhibit irrelevant information improves during this age group, with there being a sharp improvement in selective attention from age six into adolescence (Vakil, Blachstein, Sheinman, & Greenstein, 2009). Children also improve in their ability to shift their attention between tasks or different features of a task (Carlson, Zelazo, & Faja, 2013). A younger child who is asked to sort objects into piles based on the type of object, car versus animal, or color of an object, red versus blue, would likely have no trouble doing so. But if you ask them to switch from sorting based on type to now having them sort based on color, they would struggle because this requires them to suppress the prior sorting rule. An older child has less difficulty making the switch, meaning there is greater flexibility in their intentional skills. These changes in attention and working memory contribute to children having more strategic approaches to challenging tasks.\nMemory Strategies: Bjorklund (2005) describes a developmental progression in the acquisition and use of memory strategies. Such strategies are often lacking in younger children, but increase in frequency as children progress through elementary school. Examples of memory strategies include rehearsing information you wish to recall, visualizing and organizing\n433 Image by Anchor is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA\ninformation, creating rhymes, such as 'i' before 'e' except after 'c', or inventing acronyms, such as 'roygbiv' to remember the colors of the rainbow. Schneider, Kron-Sperl, and Hünnerkopf (2009) reported a steady increase in the use of memory strategies from ages six to ten in their longitudinal study. Moreover, by age ten many children were using two or more memory strategies to help them recall information. Schneider and colleagues found that there were considerable individual differences at each age in the use of strategies, and that children who utilized more strategies had better memory performance than their same-aged peers."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Processes\nAs children enter school and learn more about the world, they develop more categories for concepts and learn more efficient strategies for storing and retrieving information. One significant reason is that they continue to have more experiences on which to tie new information. In other words, their knowledge base , knowledge in particular areas that makes learning new information easier, expands (Berger, 2014).\nFigure 12.15 - As children learn more about the world, their knowledge base grows. 434\nMetacognition: refers to the knowledge we have about our own thinking and our ability to use this awareness to regulate our own cognitive processes (Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & Ronning, 2004). Children in this developmental stage also have a better understanding of how well they are performing a task, and the level of difficulty of a task. As they become more realistic about their abilities, they can adapt studying strategies to meet those needs. Young children spend as much time on an unimportant aspect of a problem as they do on the main point, while older children start to learn to prioritize and gauge what is significant and what is not. As a result, they develop metacognition.\nCritical thinking , or a detailed examination of beliefs, courses of action, and evidence , involves teaching children how to think. The purpose of critical thinking is to evaluate information in ways that help us make informed decisions. Critical thinking involves better understanding a problem through gathering, evaluating, and selecting information, and also by considering many possible solutions. Ennis (1987) identified several skills useful in critical thinking. These include: Analyzing arguments, clarifying information, judging the credibility of a source, making\n434\nvalue judgments, and deciding on an action. Metacognition is essential to critical thinking because it allows us to reflect on the information as we make decisions.\nChildren differ in their cognitive process and these differences predict both their readiness for school, academic performance, and testing in school.

Good intelligence tests are reliable, meaning that they are consistent over time, and also demonstrate validity, meaning that they actually measure intelligence rather than something else . Because intelligence is such an important part of individual differences, psychologists have invested substantial effort in creating and improving measures of intelligence, and these tests are now considered the most accurate of all psychological tests.\nIntelligence changes with age. A 3-year-old who could accurately multiply 183 by 39 would certainly be intelligent, but a 25-year-old who could not do so would be seen as unintelligent. Thus understanding intelligence requires that we know the norms or standards in a given population of people at a given age. The standardization of a test involves giving it to a large number of people at different ages and computing the average score on the test at each age level.\nOnce the standardization has been accomplished, we have a picture of the average abilities of people at different ages and can calculate a person's mental age , which is the age at which a person is performing intellectually. If we compare the mental age of a person to the person's chronological age, the result is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a measure of intelligence that is adjusted for age. A simple way to calculate IQ is by using the following formula:"

What is considered smart varies culturally as well, and most intelligence tests do not take this variation into account. For example, in the West, being smart is associated with being quick.

Intellectual disability (or intellectual developmental disorder ) is assessed based on cognitive capacity (IQ) and adaptive functioning. The severity of the disability is based on adaptive functioning, or how well the person handles everyday life tasks. About 1% of the United States population, most of them males, fulfill the criteria for intellectual developmental disorder, but some children who are given this diagnosis lose the classification as they get older and better learn to function in society (Greenspan, Loughlin, & Black, 2001).\nOne example of an intellectual developmental disorder is Down syndrome , a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at approximately 1 per 700 births, and the prevalence increases\n439 Image by CNX Psychology is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n440 Introduction to Psychology - Measures of Intelligence references Psychology by OpenStax CNX, licensed under CC BY 4.0\nas the mother's age increases (CDC, 2014a).

We no longer use terms such as 'retarded,' 'moron,' 'idiot,' or 'imbecile' to describe people with intellectual differences, although these were the official psychological terms used to describe degrees of what was referred to as mental retardation in the past. Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of mental and physical disability."

It is often assumed that school children who are labeled as 'gifted' may have adjustment problems that make it more difficult for them to create and maintain social relationships.\nFigure 12.18 - Children who get a score on an intelligence test showing an IQ of 130 or higher are labeled as gifted. 442\n441 Image by Vanellus Foto is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n442 Image by Ben Mullins on Unsplash\nThere are also different types and areas of intelligence and giftedness. Some children are particularly good at math or science, some at automobile repair or carpentry, some at music or art, some at sports or leadership, and so on. There is a lively debate among scholars about whether it is appropriate or beneficial to label some children as 'gifted and talented' in school and to provide them with accelerated special classes and other programs that are not available to everyone. Although doing so may help the gifted kids (Colangelo & Assouline, 2009), it also may isolate them from their peers and make such provisions unavailable to those who are not classified as 'gifted.'

The most common fluency disorder is stuttering.\nStuttering is a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech, which is called dysfluency (Medline Plus, 2016b). About 5% of young children, aged two-five, will develop some stuttering that may last from several weeks to several years (Medline Plus, 2016c). Approximately 75% of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining 25%, stuttering can persist as a lifelong communication disorder (National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders, NIDCD, 2016). This is called developmental stuttering and is the most common form of stuttering.\nBrain injury, and in very rare instances, emotional trauma may be other triggers for developing problems with stuttering. In most cases of developmental stuttering, other family members share the same communication disorder. Researchers have recently identified variants in four genes that are more commonly found in those who stutter (NIDCD, 2016).\nFigure 12.26 - Speech therapy. 461"

In its current form, the law guarantees the following rights related to education for anyone with a disability from birth to age 21.\nThe first two rights influence schooling in general, but the last three affect the work of classroom teachers rather directly:\n- Free, appropriate public education (FAPE) : An individual or an individual's family should not have to pay for education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational program should be truly educational; i.e., not merely caretaking or babysitting. School districts provide this education from ages 3-21.\n- Due process : In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the schools or other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements that are fair and accessible to all parties, including the person himself or herself or the person's representative.\n- Fair evaluation of performance despite disability: Tests or other evaluations should not assume test-taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected to have, such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to allow for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made by teachers and to school-wide or 'high-stakes' testing programs.\n461 Image by EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n- Education in the 'least restrictive environment': Education for someone with a disability should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person as possible, both in the short term and in the long term. In practice, this requirement has meant including students in regular classrooms and school activities as much as possible.\n- An Individualized Educational Plan (IEP): Given that every disability is unique, instructional planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as well. In practice, this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized programs jointly with other professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or medical personnel) as part of a team. 462"

As we've learned in previous chapters, Erikson's psychosocial theory has eight stages of development over the lifespan, from infancy through late adulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completion of each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.\nDuring the elementary school stage (ages 6-12), children face the task of Industry versus Inferiority . Children begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up.\nFigure 13.1 - The academic award this boy is receiving may contribute to his sense of industry. 464\n464 Image by Janarthanan kesavan is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\nThey either develop a sense of pride and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and inadequate when they don't measure up. 465\nAccording to Erikson, children in middle childhood are very busy or industrious. They are constantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, achieving. This is a very active time and a time when they are gaining a sense of how they measure up when compared with friends. Erikson believed that if these industrious children can be successful in their endeavors, they will get a sense of confidence for future challenges. If not, a sense of inferiority can be particularly haunting during middle childhood. 466"

Freud (1933) thought that the personality consists of three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id is the selfish part of the personality and consists of biological instincts that all babies have, including the need for food and, more generally, the demand for immediate gratification. As babies get older, they learn that not all their needs can be immediately satisfied and thus develop the ego, or the rational part of the personality. As children get older still, they internalize society's norms and values and thus begin to develop their superego, which represents society's conscience. If a child does not develop normally and the superego does not become strong enough, the individual is more at risk for being driven by the id to commit antisocial behavior. 467\nFigure 13.2 - Development of the superego helps children overcome their unconscious desire to behave antisocially. 468"

Just as Piaget believed that children's cognitive development follows specific patterns, Kohlberg (1984) argued that we learn our moral values through active thinking and reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six stages are generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development, Kohlberg looked at how children (and adults) respond to moral dilemmas. One of Kohlberg's best known moral dilemmas is the Heinz dilemma:\nIn Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money but he could only get together about $1,000, about half of what the drug cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: 'No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.' Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have done that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379) 469"

    "context_enriched_content": "Level One - Preconventional Morality\nIn stage one, moral reasoning is based on concepts of punishment. The child believes that if the consequence for an action is punishment, then the action was wrong. In the second stage, the child bases his or her thinking on self-interest and reward (\"You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\"). The youngest subjects seemed to answer based on what would happen to the man as a result of the act. For example, they might say the man should not break into the pharmacy because the pharmacist might find him and beat him. Or they might say that the man should break in and steal the drug and his wife will give him a big kiss. Right or wrong, both decisions were based on what would physically happen to the man as a result of the act. This is a selfcentered approach to moral decision-making. He called this most superficial understanding of right and wrong preconventional morality. Preconventional morality focuses on self-interest. Punishment is avoided and rewards are sought . Adults can also fall into these stages, particularly when they are under pressure."

For one, people may use higher levels of reasoning for some types of problems but revert to lower levels in situations where doing so is more consistent with their goals or beliefs (Rest, 1979). Second, it has been argued that the stage model is particularly appropriate for Western, rather than non-Western, samples in which allegiance to social norms, such as respect for authority, may be particularly important (Haidt, 2001). In addition, there is frequently little correlation\n|\nbetween how we score on the moral stages and how we behave in real life.

These beliefs include personal attributes, such as one's age, physical characteristics, behaviors, and competencies. Children in middle childhood have a more realistic sense of self than do those in early childhood. That exaggerated sense of self as 'biggest' or 'smartest' or 'tallest' gives way to an understanding of one's strengths and weaknesses. This can be attributed to greater experience in comparing one's own performance with that of others and to greater cognitive flexibility.\nA child's self-concept can be influenced by peers and family and the messages they send about a child's worth. Contemporary children also receive messages from the media about how they should look and act. Movies, music videos, the internet, and advertisers can all create cultural images of what is desirable or undesirable and this too can influence a child's self-concept.\nFigure 13.3 - Interactions with the media children's perception of themselves. 471\nInternalizing others' appraisals and creating social comparison affect children's self-esteem, which is defined as an evaluation of one's identity.

Intrinsic motivation thus represents engagement in an activity for its own sake. For example, if comforting a friend makes a child feel good, they are intrinsically motivated to respond to their friend's distress.\nExtrinsically motivated behaviors, on the other hand, are performed to receive something from others or avoid certain negative outcomes. The extrinsic motivator is outside of, and acts on, the individual. Rewards-such as a sticker, or candy-are good examples of extrinsic motivators.

In addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students' motives are affected by specific beliefs about their capacities. In self-efficacy theory the beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997).  As mentioned previously, the optimal level seems to be either at or slightly above true capacity (Bandura, 1997).\n473 Image by strausadolf on Pixabay\nLarge discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational problems for the individual (Seifert, 2011). If a student believes that he or she can solve mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework that the teacher assigns.\nUnfortunately, the converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is incapable of math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math homework regardless of the student's actual ability in math. Since self-efficacy is self-constructed, students can miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and these misperceptions can have complex effects on students' motivations. It is possible to have either too much or too little self-efficacy, and according to Bandura (1997), the optimal level seems to be either at, or slightly above, true ability. 474"

    "context_enriched_content": "Learned Helplessness and Self-Efficacy\nIf a person's sense of self-efficacy is very low, he or she can develop learned helplessness , a perception of complete lack of control in mastering a task. The attitude is similar to depression, a pervasive feeling of apathy, and a belief that effort makes no difference and does not lead to success. Learned helplessness was originally studied from the behaviorist perspective of classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman (1995). In people, learned helplessness leads to characteristic ways of dealing with problems. They tend to attribute the source of a problem to themselves, to generalize the problem to many aspects of life, and to see the problem as lasting or permanent. More optimistic individuals, in contrast, are more likely to attribute a problem to outside sources, to see it as specific to a particular situation or activity, and to see it as temporary or time-limited. Consider, for example, two students who each fail a test. The one with a lot of learned helplessness is more likely to explain the failure by saying something like: 'I'm stupid; I never perform well on any schoolwork, and I never will perform well at it.' The other, more optimistic student is more likely to say something like: 'The teacher made the test too hard this time, so the test doesn't prove anything about how I will do next time or in other subjects.'\nFigure 13.5 - If this girl thinks that studying won't help her do well on the test, her low self-efficacy may develop into learned helplessness. 475\n474 Lifespan Development - Module 6: Middle Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan\nPsychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n475\nImage by amenclinicsphotos ac is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n|\nWhat is noteworthy about these differences in perception is how much the more optimistic of these perspectives resembles high self-efficacy and how much learned helplessness seems to contradict or differ from it. As already noted, high self-efficacy is a strong belief in one's capacity to carry out a specific task successfully. By definition, therefore, self-efficacy focuses attention on a temporary or time-limited activity (the task), even though the cause of successful completion (oneself) is 'internal.' 476"

Because this contact occurs in our most formative years, our parents' interaction with us and the messages they teach us can have a profound impact throughout our lives. During middle childhood, children spend less time with parents and more time with their peers. Parents may have to modify their approach to parenting to accommodate the child's growing independence.

Within the home, parental marital difficulty or divorce affects more than half the children growing up today in the United States. Divorce is typically associated with economic stresses for children and parents, the renegotiation of parent-child relationships (with one parent typically as primary custodian and the other assuming a visiting relationship), and many other significant adjustments for children.

Now, the mother is often the supplementary provider while retaining the responsibilities of child-rearing. In this scenario, females' role in the labor force is \"compatible with the demands of the traditional family.'

More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment.\nConscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.' 490\nBlended families describe families with mixed parents: one or both parents remarried, bringing children of the former family into the new family 491 . Blended families are complex in a number of ways that can pose unique challenges to those who seek to form successful stepfamily relationships (Visher & Visher, 1985). These families are also referred to as stepfamilies."

Legal adoption permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities and is intended to affect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. As introduced in Chapter 2, adoption can be done privately, through an agency, or through foster care and in the U.S. or from abroad. Adoptions can be closed (no contact with birth/biological families or open, with different degrees of contact with birth/biological families).  Couples, both opposite and same-sex, and single parents can adopt (although not all agencies and foreign countries will work with unmarried, single, or same-sex intended parents). 497\nWhen parents are not of the same ethnicity, they build interracial families.

    "context_enriched_content": "Factors Affecting the Impact of Divorce\nAs you look at the consequences (both pro and con) of divorce and remarriage on children, keep these family functions in mind.  Some negative consequences are a result of financial hardship rather than divorce per se (Drexler, 2005).  Some positive consequences reflect improvements in meeting these functions.  For instance, we have learned that positive selfesteem comes in part from a belief in the self and one's abilities rather than merely being complemented by others.  In single-parent homes, children may be given more opportunity to discover their own abilities and gain independence that fosters self-esteem.  If divorce leads to fighting between the parents and the child is included in these arguments, their self-esteem may suffer.\nThe impact of divorce on children depends on a number of factors. The degree of conflict before the divorce plays a role. If the divorce means a reduction in tensions, the child may feel relief. If the parents have kept their conflicts hidden, the announcement of a divorce can come as a shock and be met with enormous resentment. Another factor that has a great impact on the child concerns financial hardships they may suffer, especially if financial support is inadequate. Another difficult situation for children of divorce is the position they are put into if the parents continue to argue and fight-especially if they bring the children into those arguments.\nShort-term consequences : In roughly the first year following divorce, children may exhibit some of these short-term effects:\n1. Grief over losses suffered . The child will grieve the loss of the parent they no longer see as frequently.  The child may also grieve about other family members that are no longer available.  Grief sometimes comes in the form of sadness but it can also be experienced as anger or withdrawal. Older children may feel depressed.\n500 Lifespan Development - Module 6: Middle Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n2. Reduced Standard of Living .  Very often, divorce means a change in the amount of money coming into the household. Children experience new constraints on spending or entertainment.  School-aged children, especially, may notice that they can no longer have toys, clothing, or other items to which they've grown accustomed.  Or it may mean that there is less eating out or being able to afford cable television, and so on. The custodial parent may experience stress at not being able to rely on child support payments or having the same level of income as before.  This can affect decisions regarding healthcare, vacations, rents, mortgages, and other expenditures.  And the stress can result in less happiness and relaxation in the home.  The parent who has to take on more work may also be less available to the children.\n3. Adjusting to Transitions .  Children may also have to adjust to other changes accompanying a divorce.  The divorce might mean moving to a new home and changing schools or friends.  It might mean leaving a neighborhood that has meant a lot to them as well.\nLong-Term consequences : Here are some effects that go beyond just the first year following divorce.\n1. Economic/Occupational Status .  One of the most commonly cited long-term effects of divorce is that children of divorce may have lower levels of education or occupational status.  This may be a consequence of lower income and resources for funding education rather than to divorce per se. In those households where economic hardship does not occur, there may be no impact on economic status (Drexler, 2005).\n2. Improved Relationships with the Custodial Parent (usually the mother): Most children of divorce lead happy, well-adjusted lives and develop stronger, positive relationships with their custodial parent (Seccombe and Warner, 2004). Others have also found that relationships between mothers and children become closer and stronger (Guttman, 1993) and suggest that greater equality and less rigid parenting is beneficial after divorce (Steward, Copeland, Chester, Malley, and Barenbaum, 1997).\n3. Greater emotional independence in sons . Drexler (2005) notes that sons who are raised by mothers only develop an emotional sensitivity to others that is beneficial in relationships.\n4. Feeling more anxious in their own love relationships. Children of divorce may feel more anxious about their own relationships as adults.  This may reflect a fear of divorce if things go wrong, or it may be a result of setting higher expectations for their own relationships.\n5. Adjustment of the custodial parent .  Furstenberg and Cherlin (1991) believe that the primary factor influencing the way that children adjust to divorce is the way the custodial parent adjusts to the divorce.  If that parent is adjusting well, the children will benefit.  This may explain a good deal of the variation we find in children of divorce. 501"

    "context_enriched_content": "Sibling Relationships\nSiblings spend a considerable amount of time with each other and offer a unique relationship that is not found with same-age peers or with adults. Siblings play an important role in the development of social skills. Cooperative and pretend play interactions between younger and older siblings can teach empathy, sharing, and cooperation (Pike, Coldwell, & Dunn, 2005) as well as negotiation and conflict resolution (Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). However, the quality of sibling relationships is often mediated by the quality of the parent-child relationship and the psychological adjustment of the child (Pike et al., 2005). For instance, more negative interactions between siblings have been reported in families where parents had poor patterns of communication with their children (Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1994). Children who have emotional and behavioral problems are also more likely to have negative interactions with their siblings. However, the psychological adjustment of the child can sometimes be a reflection of the parent-child relationship. Thus, when examining the quality of sibling interactions, it is often difficult to tease out the separate effect of adjustment from the effect of the parent-child relationship.\nWhile parents want positive interactions between their children, conflicts are going to arise, and some confrontations can be the driving force for growth in children's social and cognitive skills. The sources of conflict between siblings often depend on their respective ages. Dunn and Munn (1987) revealed that over half of all sibling conflicts in early childhood were disputes about property rights. By middle childhood this starts shifting toward control over social situations, such as what games to play, disagreements about facts or opinions, or rude behavior (Howe, Rinaldi, Jennings, & Petrakos, 2002). Researchers have also found that the strategies children use to deal with conflict change with age, but that this is also tempered by the nature of the conflict.\n502 Image by the Scott Air Force Base is in the public domain\n|\nAbuhatoum and Howe (2013) found that coercive strategies (e.g., threats) were preferred when the dispute centered on property rights, while reasoning was more likely to be used by older siblings and in disputes regarding control over the social situation. However, younger siblings also use reasoning, frequently bringing up the concern of legitimacy (e.g., 'You're not the boss') when in conflict with an older sibling. This is a very common strategy used by younger siblings and is possibly an adaptive strategy for younger siblings to assert their autonomy (Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013). A number of researchers have found that children who can use non-coercive strategies are more likely to have a successful resolution, whereby a compromise is reached and neither child feels slighted (Ram & Ross, 2008; Abuhatoum & Howe, 2013).\nNot surprisingly, friendly relationships with siblings often lead to more positive interactions with peers. Positive interactions with peers may also help a child get along better with siblings."

Peers take on new importance as judges of one's worth, competence, and attractiveness. Friendships provide the opportunity for learning social skills such as how to communicate with others and how to negotiate differences. Children get ideas from one another about how to perform certain tasks, how to gain popularity, what to wear, say, and listen to, and how to act. This society of children marks a transition from a life focused on the family to a life concerned with peers. Peers play a key role in a child's self-esteem at this age as any parent who has tried to console a rejected child will tell you. No matter how complimentary and encouraging the parent may be, being rejected by friends can only be remedied by renewed acceptance. 503\nFigure 13.17 - Peers influence a child's self-esteem. 504\n503\nLifespan Development - Module 6: Middle Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan\nPsychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n504\nImage by Robins Air Force Base is in the public domain\n|\nChildren's conceptualization of what makes someone a 'friend' changes from a more egocentric understanding to one based on mutual trust and commitment.

Bigelow and La Gaipa (1975) outline three stages to children's conceptualization of friendship 505 .\nTable 13.2 - Three Stages to Children's Conceptualization of Friendship 506\nFriendships are very important for children. The social interaction with another child who is similar in age, skills, and knowledge provokes the development of many social skills that are valuable for the rest of life (Bukowski, Buhrmester, & Underwood, 2011).  In these relationships, children learn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other children. They learn skills for managing conflict, such as turn-taking, compromise, and bargaining. Play also involves the mutual, sometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions, and understanding. Through these experiences, children develop friendships that provide additional sources of security and support to those provided by their parents. 507\n505 Lifespan Development - Module 6: Middle Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n506 Lifespan Development - Module 6: Middle Childhood by Lumen Learning references Psyc 200 Lifespan Psychology by Laura Overstreet, licensed under CC BY 4.0\n507\nContent by Dawn Rymond is licensed under CC BY 4.0\nLifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

    "context_enriched_content": "Five Stages of Friendship from Early Childhood through Adulthood 508\nSelman (1980) outlines five stages of friendship from early childhood through to adulthood.\n- In stage 0, momentary physical interaction , a friend is someone who you are playing with at this point in time. Selman notes that this is typical of children between the ages of three and six. These early friendships are based more on circumstances (e.g., a neighbor) than on genuine similarities.\n- In stage 1, one-way assistance , a friend is someone who does nice things for you , such as saving you a seat on the school bus or sharing a toy. However, children in this stage, do not always think about what they are contributing to the relationships. Nonetheless, having a friend is important and children will sometimes put up with a not so nice friend, just to have a friend. Children as young as five and as old as nine may be in this stage.\n- In stage 2, fair-weather cooperation , children are very concerned with fairness and reciprocity, and thus, a friend is someone who returns a favor . In this stage, if a child does something nice for a friend there is an expectation that the friend will do something nice for them at the first available opportunity. When this fails to happen, a child may break off the friendship. Selman found that some children as young as seven and as old as twelve are in this stage.\n- In stage 3, intimate and mutual sharing , typically between the ages of eight and fifteen, a friend is someone who you can tell them things you would tell no one else. Children and teens in this stage no longer 'keep score,' and do things for a friend because they genuinely care for the person. If a friendship dissolves in this stage it is usually due to a violation of trust. However, children in this stage do expect their friend to share similar interests and viewpoints and may take it as a betrayal if a friend likes someone that they do not.\n- In stage 4, autonomous interdependence , a friend is someone who accepts you and that you accept as they are . In this stage children, teens, and adults accept and even appreciate differences between themselves and their friends. They are also not as possessive, so they are less likely to feel threatened if their friends have other relationships or interests. Children are typically twelve or older in this stage."

Being accepted by other children is an important source of affirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can foreshadow later behavior problems (especially when children are rejected due to aggressive behavior). With increasing age, children confront the challenges of bullying, peer victimization, and managing conformity pressures. Social comparison with peers is an important means by which children evaluate their\n508 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nskills, knowledge, and personal qualities, but it may cause them to feel that they do not measure up well against others. For example, a boy who is not athletic may feel unworthy of his football-playing peers and revert to shy behavior, isolating himself and avoiding conversation. Conversely, an athlete who doesn't 'get' Shakespeare may feel embarrassed and avoid reading altogether.\nAlso, with the approach of adolescence, peer relationships become focused on psychological intimacy, involving personal disclosure, vulnerability, and loyalty (or its betrayal)-which significantly affect a child's outlook on the world. Each of these aspects of peer relationships requires developing very different social and emotional skills than those that emerge in parentchild relationships.

The commonly accepted beginning age for this period of development is age 12. When adolescence ends is harder to pin down. In the past, most people would have said age 18. However, the latest brain research shows that the brain continues to mature until about age 25.\nAdolescence physical development has evolved historically, with evidence indicating that this stage is lengthening as individuals start puberty earlier and transition to adulthood later than in the past. Puberty today begins, on average, at age 10-11 years for girls (with a range across cultures of 9 to 14 years), and 11-12 years for boys (with a range of 10 to 17 years). This average age of onset has decreased gradually over time since the 19th century by 3-4 months per decade, which has been attributed to a range of factors including better nutrition, obesity, increased father absence, and other environmental factors (Steinberg, 2013; Marshall & Tanner, 1986). Completion of formal education, financial independence from parents, marriage, and parenthood have all been markers of the end of adolescence and beginning of adulthood, and all of these transitions happen, on average, later now than in the past."

For both boys and girls, these changes include a growth spurt in height, growth of pubic and underarm hair, and skin changes (e.g., oiler skin, and pimples). Hormones drive these pubescent changes, particularly the increase in testosterone for boys and estrogen for girls. 518\n518 Adolescent Development by Jennifer Lansford is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\nThe adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in an individual's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and androgens. Males experience their growth spurt about two years later than females. The accelerated growth in various body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents, it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities (head, hands, and feet), followed by the arms and legs, and later the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion. During puberty, bones become harder and more brittle.\nBefore puberty, there are nearly no differences between males and females in the distribution of fat and muscle. During puberty, males grow muscle much faster than females, and females experience a higher increase in body fat. An adolescent's heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity during puberty; these changes contribute to increased strength and tolerance for exercise.\nFigure 14.1 - An adolescent boy 519\nFigure 14.2 - An adolescent girl 520"

    "context_enriched_content": "Brain Growth\nBrain Growth continues into the early 20s. The development of the frontal lobe, in particular, is important during this stage. Adolescents often engage in increased risk-taking behaviors and experience heightened emotions during puberty; this may be because the frontal lobes of their brains-which are responsible for judgment, impulse control, and planning-are still maturing until early adulthood (Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005)\n519\nImage on Pixabay\n520\nImage on Pixabay\nFigure 14.3 - The brain continues developing into early adulthood. 521\nThe brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it matures by becoming more interconnected and specialized (Giedd, 2015). The myelination and development of connections between neurons continues. This increases the white matter of the brain and allows the adolescent to make significant improvements in their thinking and processing skills. Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For example, the brain's language areas undergo myelination during the first 13 years. Completed insulation of the axons consolidates these language skills but makes it more difficult to learn a second language. With greater myelination, however, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin coating inhibits the growth of new connections (Dobbs, 2012).\nEven as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more than during childhood as the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning causes the gray matter of the brain, or the cortex, to become thinner but more efficient (Dobbs, 2012). The corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres, continues to thicken, allowing for stronger connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes more strongly connected to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and experiences into our decision-making. 522\n521 Image by Sebastian023 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n522 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nFigure 14.4 - During adolescence, the brain becomes more interconnected and specialized. 523\nThe limbic system , which regulates emotion and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes that occur at puberty. The limbic system is also related to novelty seeking and a shift toward interacting with peers. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in the control of impulses, organization, planning, and making good decisions, does not fully develop until the mid-20s. According to Giedd (2015), the significant aspect of the later developing prefrontal cortex and early development of the limbic system is the 'mismatch' in timing between the two. The approximately ten years that separates the development of these two brain areas can result in risky behavior, poor decision-making, and weak emotional control for the adolescent. When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch extends even further.\nTeens often take more risks than adults and, according to research, it is because they weigh risks and rewards differently than adults do (Dobbs, 2012). For adolescents, the brain's sensitivity to the neurotransmitter dopamine peaks, and dopamine is involved in reward circuits so the possible rewards outweigh the risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to social rewards during activities, and they prefer the company of others their same age. In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by oxytocin, which facilitates bonding and makes social connections more rewarding. With both dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is no wonder that adolescents seek peers and excitement in their lives that could end up harming them.\nBecause of all the changes that occur in the adolescent brain, the chances for abnormal development can occur, including mental illness. In fact, 50% of mental illness occurs by the age of 14 and 75% occurs by age 24 (Giedd, 2015). Additionally, during this period of development, the adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to damage from drug exposure. For example, repeated exposure to marijuana can affect cellular activity in the endocannabinoid system. Consequently, adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of repeated marijuana exposure (Weir, 2015).\n523 Image by BruceBlaus is licensed under CC BY 3.0\nHowever, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent brain, which allow the adolescent to move away from the family towards the outside world (Dobbs, 2012; Giedd, 2015). Novelty seeking and risk-taking can generate positive outcomes including meeting new people and seeking out new situations. Separating from the family and moving into new relationships and different experiences are actually quite adaptive for society. 524"

This period of physical development of the adolescent age 9-13 is divided into two phases. 525\nFigure 14.5 - Puberty brings dramatic changes in the body, including the development of primary and secondary sex characteristics. 526\nThe first phase of puberty begins when the pituitary gland begins to stimulate the production of the male sex hormone testosterone in boys and the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone in girls. The release of these sex hormones triggers the development of the primary sex characteristics , the sex organs concerned with reproduction.  It also involves height increases from 20 to 25 percent. Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of\n524 An Introduction to Nutrition- Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Pregnancy to the Toddler Years by\nMaureen Zimmerman and Beth Snow is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n525 Adolescence: Developing Independence and Identity by Charles Stangor is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 526 Image by the Open University of Hong Kong is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\nrapid growth as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2-8 inches (5-20 centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4-12 inches (10-30 centimeters) taller.\nSecondary sexual characteristics are visible physical changes not directly linked to reproduction but signal sexual maturity. The growth spurt for girls usually occurs earlier than that for boys, with some boys continuing to grow into their 20s. For males, this includes broader shoulders, an enlarged Adam's apple, and a lower voice as the larynx grows. Boys typically begin to grow facial hair between ages 14 and 16, which becomes coarser and darker, and hair growth occurs in the pubic area, under the arms, as well as the face.\nFor females, the enlargement of breasts is usually the first sign of puberty and, on average, occurs between ages 10 and 12 (Marshall & Tanner, 1986). Girl's hips broaden and pubic and underarm hair develops and becomes darker and coarser. Both boys and girls experience a rapid growth spurt during this stage. Males and females may begin shaving during this time as well as showing signs of acne on their faces and bodies.\nFigure 14.6 - Males often start shaving during puberty. 527\nAcne is an unpleasant consequence of the hormonal changes in puberty. Acne is defined as pimples on the skin due to overactive sebaceous (oil-producing) glands (Dolgin, 2011). These glands develop at a greater speed than the skin ducts that discharge the oil. Consequently, the ducts can become blocked with dead skin and acne will develop. According to the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center (2000), approximately 85% of adolescents develop acne, and boys develop acne more than girls because of greater levels of testosterone in their systems (Dolgin, 2011). Hormones that are also responsible for sexual development can also wreak havoc on the teenage skin. 528\nA major milestone in puberty for girls is menarche , the first menstrual period, typically experienced at around 12 or 13 years of age (Anderson, Dannal, & Must, 2003). The age of\n527 Image by Antiporda Productions is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n528 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nmenarche varies substantially and is determined by genetics, as well as by diet and lifestyle, since a certain amount of body fat is needed to attain menarche. Girls who are very slim, who engage in strenuous athletic activities, or who are malnourished may begin to menstruate later. Even after menstruation begins, girls whose level of body fat drops below the critical level may stop having their periods. The sequence of events for puberty is more predictable than the age at which they occur. Some girls may begin to grow pubic hair at age 10 but not attain menarche until age 15. 529"

A century ago the average age of a girl's first period in the United States and Europe was 16, while today it is around 13. Because there is no clear marker of puberty for boys, it is harder to determine if boys are maturing earlier, too. In addition to better nutrition, less positive reasons associated with early puberty for girls include increased stress, obesity, and endocrine-disrupting.\nBecause rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a source of pride or embarrassment. Girls and boys who develop more slowly than their peers may feel self-conscious about their lack of physical development; some research has found that negative feelings are particularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more likely to be bullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).  Additionally, problems are more likely to occur when the child is among the first in his or her peer group to develop. Because the preadolescent time is one of not wanting to appear different, early developing children stand out among their peer group and gravitate toward those who are older (Weir, 2016).\nEarly maturing boys tend to be physically stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturing peers; this can contribute to differences in popularity among peers, which can in turn influence the teenager's confidence. Some studies show that boys who mature earlier tend to be more popular and independent but are also at a greater risk for substance abuse and early sexual activity (Flannery, Rowe, & Gulley, 1993; Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpela, Rissanen, & Rantanen, 2001).\n531 Image by BruceBlaus is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\nEarly maturing girls may face increased teasing and sexual harassment related to their developing bodies, which can contribute to self-consciousness and place them at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Graber, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore & Cachelin, 1999). 532"

It controls the nerves and muscles used during sexual behavior. The brain regulates the release of hormones, which are believed to be the physiological origin of sexual desire. The cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that allows for thinking and reasoning, is believed to be the origin of sexual thoughts and fantasies. Beneath the cortex is the limbic system, which consists of the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and septal area. These structures are where emotions and feelings are believed to originate and are important for sexual behavior.\nThe hypothalamus is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is the small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve-cell bodies that receives input from the limbic system. Studies with lab animals have shown that destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes complete elimination of sexual behavior. One of the reasons for the importance of the hypothalamus is that it controls the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control the other glands of the body.\nFigure 14.9 - Hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland. 533\n532 Adolescence Physical Growth by Boundless.com is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0; Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 533 Image is in the public domain"

Oxytocin , also known as the hormone of love, is released during sexual intercourse when an orgasm is achieved. Oxytocin is also released in females when they give birth or are breastfeeding; it is believed that oxytocin is involved with maintaining close relationships. Both prolactin and oxytocin stimulate milk production in females. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for ovulation in females by triggering egg maturity; it also stimulates sperm production in males. Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of a mature egg in females during the process of ovulation.\nIn males, testosterone appears to be a major contributing factor to sexual motivation. Vasopressin is involved in the male arousal phase, and the increase of vasopressin during erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual behavior.\nThe relationship between hormones and female sexual motivation is not as well understood, largely due to the overemphasis on male sexuality in Western research. Estrogen and progesterone typically regulate motivation to engage in sexual behavior for females, with estrogen increasing motivation and progesterone decreasing it. The levels of these hormones rise and fall throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. Research suggests that testosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin are also implicated in female sexual motivation in similar ways as they are in males, but more research is needed to understand these relationships.\nFigure 14.10 - By the end of high school, more than half of boys and girls report engaging in sexual behaviors. 534\nSexuality will be discussed in Chapter 15, Adolescence Social-Emotional Development.

For older adolescents, only about one in ten (9%) get an optimal amount of sleep, and they are more likely to experience negative consequences the following day. These include feeling too tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school, having a depressed mood, and drinking caffeinated beverages (NSF, 2016).

    "context_enriched_content": "Substance Abuse\nMany drugs create tolerance : an increase in the dose required to produce the same effect, which makes it necessary for the user to increase the dosage or the number of times per day that the drug is taken. As the use of the drug increases, the user may develop a dependence , defined as a need to use a drug or other substance regularly. Dependence can be psychological, in which the drug is desired and has become part of the everyday life of the user, but no serious physical effects result if the drug is not obtained; or physical, in which serious physical and mental effects appear when the drug is withdrawn. Cigarette smokers who try to quit, for example, experience physical withdrawal symptoms, such as becoming tired and irritable, as well as extreme psychological cravings to enjoy a cigarette in particular situations, such as after a meal or when they are with friends.  Users may wish to stop using the drug, but when they reduce their dosage they experience withdrawal -negative experiences that accompany reducing or stopping drug use, including physical pain and other symptoms. When the user powerfully craves the drug and is driven to seek it out, over and over again, no matter what the physical, social, financial, and legal cost, we say that he or she has developed an addiction to the drug.\nIt is a common belief that addiction is an overwhelming, irresistibly powerful force, and that withdrawal from drugs is always an unbearably painful experience. But the reality is more complicated and in many cases less extreme. For one, even drugs that we do not generally think of as being addictive, such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, can be very difficult to quit using, at least for some people. On the other hand, drugs that are normally associated with addiction, including amphetamines, cocaine, and heroin, do not immediately create addiction in their users. Even for a highly addictive drug like cocaine, only about 15% of users become addicted (Robinson & Berridge, 2003; Wagner & Anthony, 2002). Furthermore, the rate of addiction is lower for those who are taking drugs for medical reasons than for those who are using drugs recreationally. Patients who have become physically dependent on morphine administered during medical treatment for a painful injury or disease can be rapidly weaned off the drug afterward, without becoming addicts. 564\n564 Altering Consciousness With Psychoactive Drugs by The Open University of Hong Kong is licensed under CC BY-\nPeople have used, and often abused, psychoactive drugs for thousands of years. Perhaps this should not be surprising, because many people find using drugs to be enjoyable.

They are more likely to drop out of school and are less likely to be fully functional members of society when they reach adulthood.\nDepressive disorders in young people confer a higher risk for illness and interpersonal and psychosocial difficulties that persist after the depressive episode is over. About 11 percent of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18 according to the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). Teens with depression were often dismissed as being moody or difficult. With medication, psychotherapy, or combined treatment, most youth with depression can be effectively treated. Youth are more likely to respond to treatment if they receive it early in the course of their illness.\nFurthermore, many adults who suffer from mental disorders have problems that originated in childhood. Depression in youth may predict more severe illness in adult life. Appropriate treatment at the time of onset can prevent many problems in the future."

Teen thinking is also characterized by the ability to consider multiple points of view, imagine hypothetical situations, debate ideas and opinions (e.g., politics, religion, and justice), and form new ideas. In addition, it's not uncommon for adolescents to question authority or challenge established societal norms.\nCognitive empathy , or theory-of-mind, (the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others) begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of social problem solving and conflict avoidance (Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, & Aharon-Peretz, 2005). According to one longitudinal study, levels of cognitive empathy begin rising in girls around 13 years of age, and around 15 years in boys (Van der Graaff et al., 2013). 571"

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Changes in the Brain\nEarly in adolescence, changes in the brain elevate the desire to increase the amount of Dopamine , one of the brain's many chemicals that serves as a neurotransmitter. The brain has several dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in motivating reward-motivated behavior. Anticipating most kinds of rewards increases dopamine levels as do many addictive\n571 Psychology - 9.3 Stages of Development by CNX Psychology is licensed under CC BY 4.0\ndrugs, producing feelings of pleasure. During adolescence, people tend to do whatever activities produce the most dopamine without fully considering the consequences of such actions.\nLater in adolescence, the prefrontal cortex , the area of the brain responsible for outcomes, forming judgments, controlling impulses and emotions, becomes more developed (Goldberg, 2001). The difference in timing of the development of these different regions of the brain contributes to more risk-taking during middle adolescence because adolescents are motivated to seek thrills without the prefrontal cortex's ability to appropriately control. One of the world's leading experts on adolescent development, Laurence Steinberg (2008), likens this to engaging a powerful engine before the braking system is in place. The result is that adolescents are prone to risky behaviors more often than children or adults.\nFigure 15.1 - A simulation of the risky behavior of drinking and driving. 572\nAlthough the most rapid cognitive changes occur during childhood, the brain continues to develop throughout adolescence, and even into the 20s (Weinberger, Elvevåg, & Giedd, 2005). The brain continues to form new neural connections and becomes faster and more efficient because it prunes , or casts off unused neurons and connections (Blakemore, 2008), and produces myelin , the fatty tissue that forms around axons and neurons, which helps speed transmissions between different regions of the brain (Rapoport et al., 1999). During this time of rapid cognitive growth for teens, they become more aware of their potential and capabilities, causes a great amount of disequilibrium for them. Theorists have researched cognitive changes and functions and have formed theories based on this developmental period. 573\n572 Image by the Scott Air Force Base is in the public domain\n573\nContent by Dawn Rymond is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Adolescent Development by Jennifer Lansford is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Theorists: Piaget, Elkind, Kohlberg, and Gilligan Jean Piaget: Formal Operational Stage of Cognitive Development\nCognition refers to thinking and memory processes, and cognitive development refers to longterm changes in these processes. One of the most widely known perspectives about cognitive development is the cognitive stage theory of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget . Piaget studied and created a theory about how children and youth gradually become able to think logically and scientifically. Because his theory is especially popular among educators, we focus on it in this chapter.\nPiaget was a psychological constructivist : in his view, learning was proceeded by the interplay of assimilation (adjusting new experiences to fit prior concepts) and accommodation (adjusting concepts to fit new experiences). The to-and-fro of these two processes leads not only to shortterm learning, but also to long-term developmental change . The long-term developments are really the main focus of Piaget's cognitive theory.\nPiaget proposed that cognition developed through distinct stages from birth through the end of adolescence. By stages he meant a sequence of thinking patterns with four key features:\n1. They always happen in the same order.\n2. No stage is ever skipped.\n3. Each stage is a significant transformation of the stage before it.\n4. Each later stage incorporated the earlier stages into itself.\nThis is a clear example of the 'staircase' model of development. Piaget proposed four major stages of cognitive development, and called them (1) sensorimotor intelligence, (2) preoperational thinking, (3) concrete operational thinking, and (4) formal operational thinking. Each stage is correlated with an age period of childhood, but only approximately. Formal operational thinking appears in adolescence. 574\nDuring the formal operational stage, adolescents are able to understand abstract principles . They are no longer limited by what can be directly seen or heard, and are able to contemplate such constructs as beauty, love, freedom, and morality. Additionally, while younger children solve problems through trial and error, adolescents demonstrate hypothetical-deductive reasoning , which is developing hypotheses based on what might logically occur. They are able to think about all the possibilities in a situation beforehand, and then test them systematically, (Crain, 2005). They are able to engage in true scientific thinking.\n574 Educational Psychology - Cognitive Development: The Theory of Jean Piaget by Kelvin Seifert and Rosemary Sutton is licensed under CC BY\nFigure 15.2 - Teenage thinking is characterized by the ability to reason logically and solve hypothetical problems such as how to design, plan, and build a structure. 575"

    "context_enriched_content": "Does everyone reach formal operations?\nAccording to Piaget, most people attain some degree of formal operational thinking, but use formal operations primarily in the areas of their strongest interest (Crain, 2005). In fact, most adults do not regularly demonstrate formal operational thought. A possible explanation is that an individual's thinking has not been sufficiently challenged to demonstrate formal operational thought in all areas."

The egocentricity comes from attributing unlimited power to their own thoughts (Crain, 2005). Piaget believed it was not until adolescents took on adult roles that they would be able to learn the limits to their own thoughts."

    "context_enriched_content": "David Elkind: On Piaget's Theory\nDavid Elkind (1967) expanded on the concept of Piaget's adolescent egocentricity. Elkind theorized that the physiological changes that occur during adolescence result in adolescents being primarily concerned with themselves. Additionally, since adolescents fail to differentiate between what others are thinking and their own thoughts, they believe that others are just as fascinated with their behavior and appearance. This belief results in the adolescent anticipating the reactions of others, and consequently constructing an imaginary audience. The imaginary audience is the adolescent's belief that those around them are as concerned and focused on their appearance as they are themselves (Schwartz, Maynard, & Uzelac, 2008, p. 441). Elkind thought that the imaginary audience contributed to the self-consciousness that occurs during early adolescence. The desire for privacy and the reluctance to share personal information may be a further reaction to feeling under constant observation by others.\n575 Image by the U.S. Army CCDC is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nFigure 15.3 - This teen is likely thinking, 'they must be whispering about me.' 576\nAnother important consequence of adolescent egocentrism is the personal fable or belief that one is unique, special, and invulnerable to harm. Elkind (1967) explains that because adolescents feel so important to others (imaginary audience) they regard themselves and their feelings as being special and unique. Adolescents believe that only they have experienced strong and diverse emotions, and therefore others could never understand how they feel. This belief in the uniqueness of one's emotional experiences reinforces the adolescent's belief of invulnerability, especially to death. Adolescents will engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex, and feel they will not suffer any negative consequences. Elkind believed that adolescent egocentricity emerged in early adolescence and declined in middle adolescence, however, recent research has also identified egocentricity in late adolescence (Schwartz, et al., 2008)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Consequences of Formal Operational Thought\nAs adolescents are now able to think abstractly and hypothetically, they exhibit many new ways of reflecting on information (Dolgin, 2011). For example, they demonstrate greater introspection or thinking about one's thoughts and feelings. They begin to imagine how the world could be, which leads them to become idealistic or insisting upon high standards of behavior. Because of their idealism, they may become critical of others, especially adults in their life. Additionally, adolescents can demonstrate hypocrisy , or pretend to be what they are not. Since they are able to recognize what others expect of them, they will conform to those expectations for their emotions and behavior seemingly hypocritical to themselves. Lastly, adolescents can exhibit pseudostupidity, which is when they approach problems at a level that is too complex and they fail because the tasks are too simple. Their new ability to consider alternatives is not completely under control and they appear 'stupid' when they are in fact bright, just inexperienced. 577\n576 Image by Twentyfour Students is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n577 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

He wanted to find out how people decide what is right and what is wrong (moral justice). Kohlberg argued that we learn our moral values through active thinking and reasoning, and that moral development follows a series of stages. Kohlberg's six stages are generally organized into three levels of moral reasons. To study moral development, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to children, teenagers, and adults. He used the Heinz dilemma:\nA woman was on her deathbed. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: 'No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.' So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not? 578\nBased on their reasoning behind their responses (not whether they thought Heinz made the right choice or not), Kohlberg placed each person in one of the  6 stages:"

    "context_enriched_content": "Carol Gilligan: Morality of Care\nCarol Gilligan has argued that, because of differences in their socialization, males tend to value principles of justice and rights, whereas females value caring for and helping others. Although there is little evidence that boys and girls score differently on Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Turiel, 1998), it is true that girls and women tend to focus more on issues of caring, helping, and connecting with others than do boys and men (Jaffee & Hyde, 2000). 580 Gilligan, whose ideas center on a morality of care, or system of beliefs about human responsibilities, care, and consideration for others, proposed three moral positions that represent different extents or breadth of ethical care. Unlike Kohlberg, or Piaget, she does not claim that the positions form a strictly developmental sequence, but only that they can be ranked hierarchically according to their depth or subtlety. In this respect her theory is 'semidevelopmental' in a way similar to Maslow's theory of motivation (Brown & Gilligan, 1992; Taylor, Gilligan, & Sullivan, 1995). The following table summarizes the three moral positions from Gilligan's theory:\nTable 15.1 - Positions of Moral Development According to Gilligan\n\nPosition 1: Survival Orientation, Definition of What is Morally Good = Action that considers one's personal needs only. One is concerned with their own welfare.. Position 2: Conventional Care, Definition of What is Morally Good = Action that considers others' needs or preferences but not one's own. Position 3: Integrated Care, Definition of What is Morally Good = Action that attempts to coordinate one's own personal needs with those of others\nWe've learned that major changes in the structure and functioning of the brain occur during adolescence.  These changes include improvements in cognitive functions in areas such as memory, encoding, and storage as well as the ability to think about thinking , therefore becoming better at information processing functions. 581"

Frequently, they might take a job, travel, or find other ways to experience another culture.

However, almost 9% of all drivers involved in fatal crashes that year were young drivers (NCSA, 2016), and according to the National Center for Health Statistics (2014), motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for 15 to 20 year-olds.

Wisdom , or the capacity for insight and judgment that is developed through experience, increases between the ages of 14 and 25, and increases with maturity, life experiences, and cognitive development. Wisdom increases gradually and is not the same as intelligence, and adolescents do not improve substantially on IQ tests since their scores are relative to others in their age group, as everyone matures at approximately the same rate. Adolescents must be monitored because they are more likely to take dangerous risks than adults. The behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.

In adolescence, children (ages 12-18) face the task of identity vs. role confusion. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of fidelity . Fidelity involves being able to commit one's self to others on the basis of accepting others, even when there may be ideological differences . According to Erikson, an adolescent's main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as 'Who am I?' and 'What do I want to do with my life?' Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see which ones fit; they explore various roles and ideas, set goals, and attempt to discover their 'adult' selves. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people's perspectives. When adolescents are apathetic, do not make a conscious search for identity, or are pressured to conform to their parents' ideas for the future, they may develop a weak sense of self and experience role confusion. They will be unsure of their identity and confused about the future. Teenagers who struggle to adopt a positive role will likely struggle to 'find' themselves as adults. 599\nErikson saw this as a period of confusion and experimentation regarding identity and how one navigates along life's path. During adolescence, we experience psychological moratorium , where teens put their current identity on hold while they explore their options for identity. The culmination of this exploration is a more coherent view of oneself. Those who are unsuccessful at resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social isolation or become lost in the crowd. However, more recent research suggests, that few leave this age period with identity achievement and that most identity formation occurs during young adulthood (Côtè, 2006). 600\n598 Introduction to Psychology by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 599 Education, Society, & the K-12 Learner - Part II: Educational Psychology references Modification of Erickson's Stages of Psychosocial Development by Boundless, which is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n600 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

During high school and college years, teens and young adults move from identity diffusion and foreclosure toward moratorium and achievement. The biggest gains in the development of identity are in college, as college students are exposed to a greater variety of career choices, lifestyles, and beliefs. This is likely to spur on questions regarding identity. A great deal of the identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals, as we strive to articulate a personal vision or dream for what we hope to accomplish in the future (McAdams, 2013). 603\nTo help them work through the process of developing an identity, teenagers may try out different identities in different social situations. They may maintain one identity at home and a different type of persona when they are with their peers. Eventually, most teenagers do integrate the different possibilities into a single self-concept and a comfortable sense of identity (identity-achievement status). For teenagers, the peer group provides valuable information about the self-concept. For instance, in response to the question 'What were you like as a teenager? (e.g., cool, nerdy, awkward?),' posed on the website Answerbag, one teenager replied in this way:\nI'm still a teenager now, but from 8 th -9th grade, I didn't really know what I wanted at all. I was smart, so I hung out with the nerdy kids. I still do; my friends mean the world to me. But in the middle of 8th grade, I started hanging out with which you may call the 'cool' kids…and I also hung out with some stoners, just for variety. I pierced various parts of my body and kept my grades up. Now, I'm just trying to find who I am. I'm even doing my sophomore year in China so I can get a better view of what I want. (Answerbag, 2007). What were you like as a teenager? (e.g., cool, nerdy, awkward?). (Quoted from dojokills on http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/171753)\nA big part of what the adolescent is learning is social identity , the part of the self-concept that is derived from one's group memberships. Adolescents define their social identities according to how they are similar to and different from others, finding meaning in the sports, religious, school, gender, and ethnic categories they belong to. 604\n603 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; Table adapted from Marcia, J.

Their ability to think of the possibilities and to reason more abstractly may explain the further differentiation of the self during adolescence. However, the teen's understanding of self is often full of contradictions. Young teens may see themselves as outgoing but also withdrawn, happy yet often moody, and both smart and completely clueless (Harter, 2012). These contradictions, along with the teen's growing recognition that their personality and behavior seem to change depending on who they are with or where they are, can lead the young teen to feel like a fraud. With their parents, they may seem angrier and sullen, with their friends they are more outgoing and goofy, and at work, they are quiet and cautious. 'Which one is really me?' may be the refrain of the young teenager. Harter (2012) found that adolescents emphasize traits such as being friendly and considerate more than do children, highlighting their increasing concern about how others may see them. Harter also found that older teens add values and moral standards to their selfdescriptions.\nAs self-concept develops, so does self-esteem. In addition to the academic, social, appearance, and physical/athletic dimensions of self-esteem in middle and late childhood, teens also add perceptions of their competency in romantic relationships, on the job, and in close friendships (Harter, 2006). Self-esteem often decreases when children transition from one school setting to another, such as shifting from elementary to middle school, or junior high to high school (Ryan, Shim, & Makara, 2013). These decreases are usually temporary, unless there are additional stressors such as parental conflict, or other family disruptions (De Wit, Karioja, Rye, & Shain, 2011). Self-esteem rises from mid to late adolescence for most teenagers, especially if they feel confident in their peer relationships, their appearance, and athletic abilities (Birkeland, Melkivik, Holsen, & Wold, 2012).\n613 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nFigure 16.9 - An adolescent's understanding of their self is often full of contradictions. 614\nFigure 16.10 - Adolescents are more likely to emphasize values in their self-descriptions. 615"

From birth, children are socialized to conform to certain gender roles based on their biological sex and the gender to which they are assigned. 616 A person's subjective experience of their own gender and how it develops, or gender identity, is a topic of much debate . It is the extent to which one identifies with a particular gender; it is a person's individual sense and subjective experience of being a man, a woman, or other gender. It is often shaped early in life and consists primarily of the acceptance (or non-acceptance) of one's membership into a gender category. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females.

Biological factors that may influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels and genetic makeup. Social factors include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life. According to social-learning theory, children develop their gender identity through observing and imitating the gender-linked behaviors of others; they are then 'rewarded' for imitating the behaviors of people of the same gender and 'punished' for imitating the behaviors of another gender. For example, male children will often be rewarded for imitating their father's love of baseball but punished or redirected in some way if they imitate their older sister's love of dolls. Children are shaped and molded by the people surrounding them, who they try to imitate and follow."

We engage in gender stereotyping when we do things like making the assumption that a teenage babysitter is female.\nWhile it is somewhat acceptable for women to take on a narrow range of masculine characteristics without repercussions (such as dressing in traditionally male clothing), men are rarely able to take on more feminine characteristics (such as wearing skirts) without the risk of harassment or violence. This threat of punishment for stepping outside of gender norms is especially true for those who do not identify as male or female.\nFigure 16.13 - Would girls likely pose this way for an image? What does this say about gender stereotypes? 620\nGender stereotypes form the basis of sexism, or the prejudiced beliefs that value males over females. Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender-role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes people's expectations of how members of a gender group should behave. For example, girls and women are expected to be friendly, passive, and nurturing; when she behaves in an unfriendly or\nImage on Pixabay\nassertive manner, she may be disliked or perceived as aggressive because she has violated a gender role (Rudman, 1998).

This decrease in the time spent with families may be a reflection of a teenager's greater desire for independence or autonomy. It can be difficult for many parents to deal with this desire for autonomy. However, it is normal for teenagers to increasingly distance themselves and establish relationships outside of their families in preparation for adulthood.\nChildren in middle and late childhood are increasingly given greater freedom regarding basic decision making. This continues in adolescence, as teens demand more and more control over the decisions that affect their daily lives. Teens believe they should manage the areas that parents previously had considerable control over, which can increase tension between parents and their teenagers. Their arguments often center on issues of a power struggle or conflict in areas such as chores, homework, curfew, dating, personal appearance, and the right to privacy.\nFigure 16.14 - Teenagers report more conflicts with their mothers. 622\nAs teens grow older, more compromise is reached between parents and teenagers (Smetana, 2011). Teens report more conflict with their mothers, as many mothers believe they should still have some control over many of these areas, yet often report their mothers to be more encouraging and supportive (Costigan, Cauce, & Etchison, 2007). Parents are more controlling of daughters, especially early-maturing girls, than they are sons (Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, & Silva,\n621 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n622 Image by Wikivisual is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n1993). In addition, culture and ethnicity also play a role in how restrictive parents are with the daily lives of their children (Chen, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, Soensens, & Van Petegem, 2013). 623\nHaving a supportive, less conflict-ridden relationships with parents also benefits teenagers. Research on attachment in adolescence finds that teens who are still securely attached to their parents have less emotional problems (Rawatlal, Kliewer & Pillay, 2015), are less likely to engage in drug abuse and other criminal behaviors (Meeus, Branje & Overbeek, 2004), and have more positive peer relationships (Shomaker & Furman, 2009). This means that both parents and teenagers need to strike a balance between autonomy, while still maintaining close and caring familial relationships. 624"

Communicating family rules and a positive parental style has been inversely associated with substance, alcohol, and tobacco consumption during adolescence. This influence is essential for adolescents' development up to adulthood. Communication between parents and adolescents emerges as a protective factor for alcohol, tobacco, and substance use (Newman, Harrison & Dashiff, 2008).\nSen (2010) observed that family meals could lead to creating a closer relationship between parents and adolescents. Although girls may attribute greater importance to family activities, boys are indifferent to them. While there are some gender differences in behaviors that are mitigated by close relationships with parents, Huebner and Howell (2003) verified that parental communication and monitoring protected adolescents of both genders from being involved in risk behaviors.\nFigure 16.15 - if this father monitors and communicates with his son, he can reduce the teen's risky behaviors. 625\n623 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n624 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n625\nImage by moodboard is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nParental monitoring can be defined as parents' knowledge about their children's activities, who they hang out with, and what they do. It has been associated with protection from various risk behaviors throughout adolescence, such as substance use or sexual behaviors.

    "context_enriched_content": "Peer Relationships\nPeers serve as an important source of social support and companionship during adolescence. As children become adolescents, they usually begin spending more time with their peers and less time with their families, and these peer interactions are increasingly unsupervised by adults. The level of influence that peers can have over an adolescent makes these relationships particularly important in their personal development. Adolescents with positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than those who are socially isolated or have conflictual peer relationships.\nAdolescents' notions of friendship increasingly focus on intimate exchanges of thoughts and feelings, which are important to forming friendships; these high-quality friendships may enhance a child's development regardless of the particular characteristics of those friends. In addition, peers also serve as an important source of social support and companionship during adolescence.\nPeers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Relationships with peers are valuable opportunities for adolescents to practice their social and conflict resolution skills. But negative peer pressure can lead adolescents to make riskier decisions or engage in more problematic behavior than they would alone or in the presence of their family. One of the most widely studied aspects of adolescent peer influence is known as deviant peer contagion (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which peers reinforce problem behavior by laughing or showing other signs of approval that then increase the likelihood of future problem behavior. 627\nPeers may strongly determine preference in the way of dressing, speaking, using illicit substances, sexual behavior, adopting and accepting violence, adopting criminal and anti-social behaviors, and in many other areas of the adolescent's life (Padilla, Walker & Bean, 2009; Tomé, Matos & Diniz, 2008). An example of this is that the main motives for alcohol consumption given by adolescents are related to social events, which usually take place in the company of friends, namely: drinking makes holidays more fun, it facilitates approaching others, it helps relaxing or facilitates sharing experiences and feelings (Kuntsche, Knibbe, Gmel\n626 How Can Peer Group Influence the Behavior of Adolescents: Explanatory Model by Gina Tomé, Margarida Matos, Celeste Simões, José Diniz, and Inês Camacho is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n627 Boundless Psychology - Adolescence references Curation and Revision by Boundless Psychology, which is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n& Engels, 2005). Also, mimicking risk behaviors may be greater when consumption begins in the context of a social event (Larsen, Engels, Souren, Granic & Overbeek, 2010).\nFigure 16.16 - Adolescent boys drinking at a party. 628\nOn the other hand, having friends allows individuals to share experiences and feelings and to learn how to solve conflicts. Not having friends, on the other hand, leads to social isolation and limited social contacts, with fewer opportunities to develop new relations and social interactional skills.\nFriendship is also positively associated with psychological well-being (Ueno, 2004). Stronger friendships may provide adolescents with an appropriate environment to develop in a healthy way and to achieve good academic results. Adolescents with reciprocal friendships mention high levels of feelings of belonging in school; at the same time, reciprocity and feelings of belonging have positive effects in academic results (Vaquera & Kao, 2008).\nSchool is a setting where interpersonal relations are promoted, which are important for youngsters' personal and social development (Ruini et al., 2009); it is responsible for the transmission of behavioral norms and standards and it represents an essential role in the adolescent's socialization process. The school is able to gather different peer communities and to promote self-esteem and a harmonious development between adolescents, which makes it a privileged space for meetings and interactions (Baptista, Tomé, Matos, Gaspar & Cruz, 2008). Adolescents spend a great part of their time at school, which also makes it a privileged context for involvement in or protection from risk behaviors (Piko & Kovács, 2010). Camacho, Tomé, Matos, Gamito and Diniz (2010) confirmed that adolescents who like school were those that more often were part of a peer group without involvement in risk behaviors; while those that mentioned they did not have any friends reported that they liked school less and those in conflict with their peers had more negative health outcomes.\n628 Image by theopie is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nFigure 16.17 - These teens are at a concert together. 629"

    "context_enriched_content": "Peers in Groups\nDuring adolescence, it is common to have friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood, peer groups evolve from primarily single-sex to mixed-sex. Teens within a peer group tend to be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes. Adolescents who spend time together also shape each other's behavior.\nPeer groups can have both positive and negative effects on adolescents.  The group may serve as a model and influence behaviors and attitudes and also provide easy access, encouragement, and an appropriate social setting for the consumption of illegal substances (Glaser, Shelton & Bree, 2010). Social Learning Theory suggests that it is not necessary for adolescents to observe a given behavior and adopt it; it is sufficient to perceive that the peer group accepts it, to be able to opt for similar behaviors (Petraitis, Flay & Miller, 1995). 630\nA factor that may be found in the influence of the peer group is the type of friendship, which adolescents maintain with their peer group; if friends are close they have a greater influence on the other's behaviors (Glaser, Shelton & Bree, 2010). When the friendship is perceived as reciprocal and of quality, it exerts greater influence (Mercken, Snijders, Steglich, Vartiainen & Vries, 2010). Another factor, which has been identified as a possible way of decreasing peer influence, is assertive refusal. Adolescents who can maintain an assertive refusal are less susceptible to the group's influence (Glaser, Shelton & Bree, 2010). These are only some variables identified as possible factors decreasing peer influence. 631\nDespite the positive influence of the peer group during adolescence, the higher the adolescent's autonomy from the peer group, the higher their resilience against its influence. This resilience seems to increase with age, which may mean that it is associated with youngsters' maturity; girls emerge in several studies as more resilient than boys (Sumter, Bokhorst, Steinberg & Westenberg, 2009).\n629 Image by Eva Rinaldi is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n630 How Can Peer Group Influence the Behavior of Adolescents: Explanatory Model by Gina Tomé, Margarida Matos, Celeste Simões, José Diniz, and Inês Camacho is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n631 How Can Peer Group Influence the Behavior of Adolescents: Explanatory Model by Gina Tomé, Margarida Matos, Celeste Simões, José Diniz, and Inês Camacho is licensed under CC BY 4.0"

Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all likely to vary based on culture. Furthermore, many distinguishing characteristics of an individual (such as dress, employment, recreation, and language) are all products of culture.\nFigure 16.18 - Culture is learned and socially shared. 632\nMany factors that shape adolescent development vary by culture. For instance, the degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous, or independent beings varies widely in different cultures, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. The lifestyle of an adolescent in a given culture is also profoundly shaped by the roles and responsibilities he or she is expected to assume. The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family responsibilities, for example, is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior. Adolescents in certain cultures are expected to contribute significantly to household chores and responsibilities, while others are given more freedom or come from families with more privilege where responsibilities are fewer. Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various socioeconomic backgrounds, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values.\nAdolescents begin to develop unique belief systems through their interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments. These belief systems encompass everything from religion and spirituality to gender, sexuality, work ethics, and politics. The range of attitudes that a culture embraces on a particular topic affects the beliefs, lifestyles, and perceptions of its adolescents, and can have both positive and negative impacts on their development.\n632 Image by Sgt.

Certain features of adolescence, particularly with respect to biological changes associated with puberty and cognitive changes associated with brain development, are relatively universal. But other features of adolescence depend largely on circumstances that are more environmentally variable. For example, adolescents growing up in one country might have different opportunities for risk-taking than adolescents in a different country, and supports and sanctions for different behaviors in adolescence depend on laws and values that might be specific to where adolescents live.\nFigure 16.19 - These values of these adolescent girls' families and communities will influence their development. 633\nDifferent cultural norms regarding family and peer relationships shape adolescents' experiences in these domains. For example, in some countries, adolescents' parents are expected to remain in control over major decisions, whereas in other countries, adolescents are expected to begin sharing in or taking control of decision making. Even within the same country, adolescents' gender, ethnicity, immigrant status, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and personality can shape both how adolescents behave and how others respond to them, creating diverse developmental contexts for different adolescents. 634\nEthnic Identity refers to how people come to terms with who they are based on their ethnic or racial ancestry. 'The task of ethnic identity formation involves sorting out and resolving positive and negative feelings and attitudes about one's own ethnic group and about other groups and identifying one's place in relation to both' (Phinney, 2006, p. 119). When groups differ in status in a culture-those from the non-dominant group have to be cognizant of the customs and values of those from the dominant culture. The reverse is rarely the case. This makes ethnic identity far less important for members of the dominant culture.\n633 Image is licensed under CC0\n634 Adolescent Development by Jennifer Lansford is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\nIn the United States, those of European ancestry engage in less exploration of ethnic identity, than do those of non-European ancestry (Phinney, 1989). However, according to the U.S. Census (2012), more than 40% of Americans under the age of 18 are from ethnic minorities. For many ethnic minority teens, discovering one's ethnic identity is an important part of identity formation. Phinney's model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson and Marcia's model of identity formation (Phinney, 1990; Syed & Juang, 2014). Through the process of exploration and commitment, individual's come to understand and create an ethnic identity.\nThe development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25% of tenth graders from ethnic minority backgrounds having explored and resolved the issues (Phinney, 1989). Ethnic minorities must also wrestle with the question of how, and to what extent, they will identify with the culture of their surroundings, thus society and with the culture of their family. Phinney (2006) suggests that people may handle it in different ways. Some may keep the identities separate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject some of them.\nBicultural identity means individuals see themselves as part of both the ethnic minority group and the larger society. Those who are multiracial , that is whose parents come from two or more ethnic or racial groups , have a more challenging task. In some cases, their appearance may be ambiguous. This can lead to others constantly asking them to categorize themselves. Phinney (2006) notes that the process of identity formation may start earlier and take longer to accomplish in those who are not monoracial or a single ethnicity. 635\nThe amount of identity exploration and achievement varies in different settings. The more ethnically homogeneous the high school, the less identity exploration and achievement (Umana-Taylor, 2003). Moreover, even in more ethnically diverse high schools, teens tend to spend more time with their own group, reducing exposure to other ethnicities. This may explain why, for many, college becomes the time of ethnic identity exploration. '[The] transition to college may serve as a consciousness-raising experience that triggers exploration' (Syed & Azmitia, 2009, p. 618).\nIt is also important to note that those who do achieve ethnic identity may periodically reexamine the issues of ethnicity. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common not only for ethnic identity formation, but in other aspects of identity development (Grotevant, 1987) and is referred to (from Marcia's Theory: Stages of Identity) as MAMA cycling or moving back and forth between moratorium and achievement. 636\n635 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\n636 Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective by Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0"

In an ongoing controversy, the media is often blamed for youth violence and many other of society's ills. The average child sees hundreds of thousands of acts of violence on television and in the movies before reaching young adulthood. Rap lyrics often seemingly extol ugly violence, including violence against women. Commercials can greatly influence our choice of soda, shoes, and countless other products. The mass media also reinforces racial and gender stereotypes, including the belief that women are sex objects and suitable targets of male violence. In the General Social Survey (GSS), about 28% of respondents said that they watch four or more hours of television every day, while another 46% watch 2-3 hours daily (see \"Average Number of Hours of Television Watched Daily\"). The media certainly are an important source of socialization that was unimaginable a half-century ago."

Studies consistently uncover a strong correlation between watching violent television shows and movies and committing violence. However, this does not necessarily mean that watching the violence actually causes violent behavior. Scholars continue to debate the effect of media violence on youth violence. In a free society, this question is especially important, as the belief in this effect has prompted calls for monitoring the media and the banning of certain acts of violence. Civil libertarians argue that such calls smack of censorship that violates the First Amendment to the Constitution, while others argue that they fall within the First Amendment and would make for a safer society. Certainly, the concern and debate over mass media violence will continue for years to come. 639"

    "context_enriched_content": "Dating and Romantic Relationships\nAdolescence is the developmental period during which romantic relationships typically first emerge. By the end of adolescence, most American teens have dated others and have had at least one romantic relationship (Dolgin, 2011). However, culture does play a role as Asian Americans and Latinas are less likely to date than other ethnic groups (Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, & Pepler, 2004). Dating serves many purposes for teens, including having fun, companionship, status, socialization, intimacy, sexual experimentation, and partner selection for those in late adolescence (Dolgin, 2011). There are several stages in the dating process, beginning with engaging in mixed-sex group activities in early adolescence (Dolgin, 2011).\nTable 16.2 - Romantic Relationships in Adolescence\n\nEarly Adolescence, Relationship = Romantic relationships often form in the context of these mixed-sex peer groups (Connolly, Furman, & Konarski, 2000). Interacting in mixed-sex groups is easier for teens as they are among a supportive group of friends, can observe others interacting, and are kept safe from becoming intimate too soon.. Middle Adolescence, Relationship = By middle adolescence, teens are engaging in brief, casual dating, or in group dating with other couples (Dolgin, 2011).. Late Adolescence, Relationship = In late adolescence, dating involves exclusive, intense relationships that are short-lived or are long-term committed partnerships, either way, their importance should not be minimized. Adolescents spend a great deal of time focused on romantic relationships or lack thereof. Their positive and negative emotions are tied to this intense interest more than they are to friendships, family relationships, or school (Furman & Shaffer, 2003).\n639 Sociology: Brief Edition - Agents of Socialization by Steven E. Barkan is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0\nFurthermore, romantic relationships are centrally connected to adolescents' emerging sexuality. Parents, policymakers, and researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to adolescents' sexuality, in large part because of concerns related to sexual intercourse, contraception, and preventing teen pregnancies. However, sexuality involves more than this narrow focus, for example, adolescence is often when individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender come to understand and define what their sexual identity is (Russell, Clarke, & Clary, 2009). Thus, romantic relationships are a domain in which adolescents experiment with new behaviors and identities. 640\nFigure 16.22 - Romantic relationships emerge in adolescence. 641"

Research has examined possible biological, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that links sexual orientation to one factor (APA, 2016). Biological explanations, that include genetics, hormones, and birth order, will be explored further. Excess or deficient exposure to hormones during prenatal development has also been theorized as an explanation for sexual orientation. Onethird of females exposed to abnormal amounts of prenatal androgens, a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), identify as bisexual or lesbian (Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, & Berenbaum, 2005). In contrast, too little exposure to prenatal androgens may affect male sexual orientation (Carlson, 2011)."

Research has shown that gay, lesbian, and bisexual teenagers are at a higher risk of depression and suicide due to exclusion from social groups, rejection from peers and family, and negative media portrayals of homosexuals (Bauermeister et al., 2010). Discrimination can occur in the workplace, in housing, at schools, and in numerous public settings. Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation.

These may manifest themselves in biological, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual aspects. The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle and the basic biological drive that exists in all species. Emotional aspects of sexuality include bonds between individuals that are expressed through profound feelings or physical manifestations of love, trust, and care. Social aspects deal with the effects of human society on one's sexuality, while spirituality concerns an individual's spiritual connection with others through sexuality. Sexuality also impacts, and is impacted by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.\nSocietal Views on Sexuality: Society's views on sexuality are influenced by everything from religion to philosophy, and they have changed throughout history and are continuously evolving. Historically, religion has been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in the United States; however, in more recent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the strongest influences, particularly among American teens (Potard, Courtois, & Rusch, 2008).\nMedia Influences on Sexuality: Media in the form of television, magazines, movies, music, online, etc., continues to shape what is deemed appropriate or normal sexuality, targeting everything from body image to products meant to enhance sex appeal. Media serves to perpetuate a number of social scripts about sexual relationships and the sexual roles of men and women, many of which have been shown to have both empowering and problematic effects on people's (especially women's) developing sexual identities and sexual attitudes.\nCultural Differences with Sexuality: In the West, premarital sex is normative by the late teens, more than a decade before most people enter marriage. In the United States and Canada, and in Northern and Eastern Europe, cohabitation is also normative; most people have at least one cohabiting partnership before marriage. In southern Europe, cohabiting is still taboo, but premarital sex is tolerated in emerging adulthood. In contrast, both premarital sex and cohabitation remain rare and forbidden throughout Asia. Even dating is discouraged until the late twenties, when it would be a prelude to a serious relationship leading to marriage. In crosscultural comparisons, about three-fourths of emerging adults in the United States and Europe report having had premarital sexual relations by age 20, versus less than one fifth in Japan and South Korea (Hatfield & Rapson, 2006). 649"

Researchers Latané and Darley (1968) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect. The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress. Instead, they just watch what is happening. Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social situation, not our own personality variables. Why do you think bystanders don't get help? What are the benefits of helping? What are the risks? It is very likely you listed more costs than benefits to helping. In many situations, bystanders likely feared for their own lives-if they went to help, the attacker might harm them. However, how difficult would it be to make a phone call to the police? Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation. Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group (Bandura, 1999). Have you ever passed an accident on the\n650 Image by Vivianlee2005 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\nfreeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident?

Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), however, involve much more severe and longerlasting behaviors than typical, short-lived episodes. These disorders include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, and pyromania. These disorders can cause people to behave angrily or aggressively toward people or property. Those diagnosed may have difficulty controlling their emotions and behavior and may break rules or laws. An estimated 6 percent of children are affected by oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. 652\nOppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD): There is a recurrent pattern of negative, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures. It is important to remember that this is toward authority figures and not their peers. This occurs outside of normal developmental levels and leads to impairment in functioning (Lack, 2010). 653\nConduct Disorder (CD): Individuals with Conduct Disorder (CD) show acts of aggression towards others and animals. They usually show little to no compassion or concern for others or their feelings. Concern for the well-being of others is at a minimum. Those with CD also perceive the actions and intentions of others as more harmful and threatening than they actually are and respond with what they feel is reasonable and justified aggression. They may lack feelings of guilt or remorse. Since these individuals learn that expressing guilt or remorse may help in avoiding or lessening punishment, it may be difficult to evaluate when their guilt or remorse is genuine. Individuals will also try and place blame on others for the wrongdoings that they had committed.\nIndividuals with conduct disorders (CD) tend to have lower levels of self-esteem.

There are many ways to answer this question. In the United States, you are legally considered an adult at 18 years old, but other definitions of adulthood vary widely; in sociology, for example, a person may be considered an adult when they become self-supporting, choose a career, get married, or start a family. The age at which we achieve this milestone varies from person to person as well as from culture to culture. For example, 50 years ago, a young adult with a high school diploma could immediately enter the workforce and climb the corporate ladder. That is no longer the case, a Bachelor's and even graduate degrees are required more and more often-even for entry-level jobs (Arnett, 2000). Also, many students are taking longer (five or six years) to complete a college degree as a result of working and going to school at the same time. After graduation, many young adults return to the family home because they have difficulty finding a job.\nFigure 16.27 - Emerging adulthood. 655\nThis is a relatively newly defined period of lifespan development. Jeffrey Arnett (2000) explains that emerging adulthood is neither adolescence nor is it young adulthood. Individuals in this age period have left behind the relative dependency of childhood and adolescence, but have not yet taken on the responsibilities of adulthood. 'Emerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible, when little about the future is decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life's possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course' (Arnett, 2000, p. 469). 656"
