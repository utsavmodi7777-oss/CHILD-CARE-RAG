Nature The National Early childhood care and education (ECCE) Policy reaffirms the Commitment of the Govt. of India to provide integrated services for holistic development of all children along the contiuam, from the prenatal period to six years of age. The policy lays down the way  forward  for  a  comprehensive  approach  towards  ensuring  a  sound  foundation  with focus on early learning for every Indian child.\n1.1.5 Objectives of Pre-school Education.\n1.1.6 Characteristics of Pre-school Education.\nThe 11 th five year plan has acknowledged the importance of Early Childhood Care Education as the stage that lays the foundation for lifelong development and the realisation of  a  child's  full  potential  and  directs  that  'all  children  be  provided  at  least  one  year preschool Education in the age group of 3-6 years'.\nUnder  Article  21A  through  86 th Amendment  of  the  constitution,  free  and  compulsory education to children in the age group of 6-14 has become a fundamental right, In addition to  this,  in  Article  45  of  the  directive  principles,  early  childhood  care  and  Education  for children up to the age of 6 years has been recommended.\nNational  Policy  in  Education  (NPE)  1986  has  given  a  great  deal  of  importance  to ECCE. Emphasizing the holistic nature of early childhood programme, it has extended ECCE to  include  the  component  of  'Care'  i.e.  Early  Childhood  care  and  Education  (ECCE).  The main elements of care are health and nutrition. ECCE requires that young children to be provided  care  opportunities  and  experiences  that  lead  to  their  all  round  developmentphysical, mental, social and emotional and school readiness.\nEarly childhood care and education is necessary as readiness for formal education. Today there is universal demand for early childhood education in the whole world.\nNPE  has  viewed  ECCE  as  an  important  input  in  the  strategy  of  human  resource development.  it has highlighted the need of community involvement in ECCE as well as the need  to  establish  a  linkage  between  integrated  Child  Development  Scheme  (ICDS)  and (ECCE) programme at all level.\nNational plan of action for children (2005) included universalisation of ECCE as one of the goals.  It  specified  care,  protection  and  development  oppertunities  for  children  below  3 years and integrated care and development and preschool learning opportunities for 3-6 years old.\nIn  the  public  sector  integrated  Child  Development  Services  (ICDS)  is  the  world's largest programme  imparting  ECCE.  Prior  to  the Universalisation of ICDS  and  its subsequent  expansion  uncovered  areas  were  attempted  to  be  covered  by  pre-primary system within the ambit of the primary school system. 1.1. Aims and objectives of Pre School Education National  curriculum  framework  (2005)  emphasized  two  years  of  pre-schooling  and considered ECCE as significant for holistic development of the child, as a preparation for schooling  and  as  a  support  service  for  woman  and  girls.  It  advocated play  based developmentally appropriate curriculum."

Brain  Development  is  highest  during  the  first  four  years  of  life .  The  brain  is forming  important  neural  path  to  help  develop  the  child's  ability  to  perform  and function and learn well. Children are able to learn at a rapid rate and want and need to learn new information.\nThey like repetition.\n2. Going hand in hand with brain development is structure. Structure is vital for the young preschooler and the child thrives in a loving, structured environment with stimulating colours, sounds, textures, classroom layout, varying activities and books.\n4. Academic are now being emphasized more than in past years because there is more research  substantiality  that  a  child  is  able  to  learn  and  perform  more  than what we used to expect. Also, there are more academic in the preschool curriculum now because the schools expect a child entering kindergarten to know what once used to be taught in kindergarten.\n3. Social  skills  are  next  on  the  list  and  they  are  important  to  learn  at  this  age rather  than  waiting  until  kinder garden age  or  later  social  skills  such  as  learning how  to  listen,  nice  talks,  brave  talks,  taking  turns,  acceptance  of  multi-cultural differences,  apologies  when  to  say  pleas  and  thank  you,  how  to  speak  in  a  group helping each other, learning compassion and empathy.There are so  many opportunities for a child to develop social skills.\n5. Pre-school  is important  the needed space it gives as a parent to work or have time to pursue interests, hobbies friends as an adult in the adult world. As a parent one still needs to grow and learn and give the community if that is something you enjoy  doing.  The  child  needs  this  time  away  from  his  parents  and  home  to  learn about the world, about people, about accepting others, making new friends. Children learn  trust  and  independence  when  given  opportunities  to  do  things  on  his  /her own  or  with  a  group,  the  child  is  learning  important  work  attributes  that  are necessary in his future.\n- According to Miss Grace Owen , the aims of pre-primary schools are:1. To provide healthy external conditions for the children like light, sun shine, space and fresh air.\n5. To give experiences of community life on a small scale where children of similar as well as varying ages work and play with one another. 6. To achieve a real unit with home life. Self Evaluation\n2. To organize a happy healthy and regular life for the children as well as continuous medical supervision. 3. To assist each child to form for himself wholesome personal habits.\n4. To give opportunity for imagination and for the development of many interests as well as skills of various kinds."

The play way method.\n1,2.1. ROUSSEAU (1712-1778A.D) Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) was born in Geneva (June 28) but become famous as a  'French'  political  philosopher  and  educationist.  His  philosophy  of  education  has  been called naturalism. His novel Emile was the most significant book on education after Plato's Republic, and his other work had a profound impact on political theory and practice, he contends that all the ills and miseries of civilization are due to departure from 'Nature.' 'Return  to  Nature'  was  his  slogan  to  cure  the world  of  ills  and  miseries.  According  to Rousseau 'God  makes  all  things  good,  man  meddles  with  them  and  they  become  evil.' According  to  him  education  means,  'Natural  development  of  organs  and  powers  of  the child'. Without understanding the natural needs of the child useful education for the child cannot be provided. Rousseau has outlined his scheme of education in his book Emile. Pre-school Education: Rousseau  expressed  his  views  on  education  including  pre-school  education  in  his  book Emile. The text is divided in to five books; the first three are dedicated to the child Emile. The fourth to an exploration of the adolescent, and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart, as well as to Emile's domestic and civic life. 1. Part one Book deals with the education of infants.\n5.\nPart five with education of girls.\n2.\nPart two with childhood.\n3.\nPart three with preadolescent.\n4.\nPart four with adolescence.\nEducation at Infancy according to Rousseau: The Child is active in nature, and never seen inactive. He should not force to do any work. It is not good to form any habits in children. Child begins to play with whatever he gets; he throws it  and  sometimes puts in his mouth. So his environment should be such that his natural activity is not obstructed toys should be natural. Tiny branches, leaves and fruits should be his toys. In the beginning, it is necessary to give knowledge of words suitable for natural  ideas.  Teaching  of  speaking  or  stress  on  speaking  before  the  proper  time  is  not useful. Child should be given full freedom and proper environment for his natural activities."

Aims  of Education ,  to  establish  harmony  in  'nature',  'man'  and  'objects'  to  leave  a complete  life.  Children  should  be  given  only  one  knowledge  and  that  knowledge  is knowledge of duty. 4 . Education through doing - Education should be practical rather than oral. 5.  Self  Education -The  mind  can  comprehend  a  thing  according  to  its  own  capacity. Learning anything by understanding, it becomes our own.\n'God makes all things good'\n, 'Plants are fashioned by cultivation, man by education'.\n6. Teaching  through  objects ,  Never  substitute  symbols  for  the  object  unless  it  is impossible to show the things itself.\n2. 8 . Play-way in Education ,  work or plays are all one to him, his, games are his work, he knows no differences.\n3. 7 . Child Centred Education , John Adams used the phrase 'Child Centre' and later on it was accepted as a chief characteristics  of  Naturalism.  According  to  it  the  child  should  be  the centre of education and education should develop his undeveloped natural instincts.\n4. 9 . Naturalism and Curriculum ,  Naturalism is indifferent towards subject teaching. It is concerned with nature only.\n- b. it  favours  utilitarian  education.  It  includes  only  utilitarian  subjects  and  subjects related with life.\n- a. It  does  not  give  any importance  to  subject  teaching.  It  considers  natural  and harmonious development of child's innate powers important.\n- c. it  is  opposed  to  bookish  knowledge.  It  gives  special  importance  to  educational activities and arts and crafts.\n10. Teaching Method ,  Accordingly to him children should be educated through activities only. The basis of method of teaching in naturalism is psychological in a way and according to the principles of child psychology. 11. Heuristic Method let him not taught science but let him discover it.\n12.  Role  of  the  Teacher ,  place  of  the  teacher  is  secondary.  Presence  of  the  teacher  has been considered necessary but his interference should be minimum. To maintain suitability of environment from time to time is also the responsibility of the teacher. Teacher should possess individual, social, psychological and human virtues so that he is able to know the abilities and aptitudes of children.\n14. Naturalism and school organization . There should be flexible organization based on liberal  and  free  atmosphere  and  natural  laws.  Nature itself is  a  school.  Rosseau  has recommended  organizing  Schools  according  to  the  nature  of  children.  Different  schools curriculum and teaching methods should be provided for the 4 stages.\n13. Discipline. ' Leave child alone' children,  too,  will  have  to  bear  the  consequences,  if they will commit mistakes in their actions. No need to impose any discipline on children.\n15.  Bookish  knowledge .  Negative  education  is  against  bookish knowledge; knowledge imparted through books is not real but artificial and imaginary. Children should be given so much freedom and facilities that they discover real knowledge themselves through direct contact with nature.\n17. Physical Education . 'All wickedness comes from weakness. The child is only naughty, because he is weak; make him strong and will be good'.\n16.  Progressiveness ,  Rousseau  has  classified  education  in  three  groups  of  teaching -individual teaching, behavior teaching and natural teaching .\n18. Vocational Education , 'It is clear (The art of Carpenter) and useful, it may be carried on at home it gives enough exercises, it calls for skill and industry, and while fashioning articles for everyday use, there is scope for elegance and taste. ' 19. Women Education , Woman's education, must be planned in relation to man. 20.  Education through Rural  and  National  Environment ,  'Cities  are  the  graves  of human species.'"

Shortly after Froebel's birth his mother's health began to fail, she died when he was nine months old; profoundly influencing his life in 1792, Froebel went to live in the small  town  of stadt-llm with  his  uncle,  a  gentle  and  affectionate  man.  At  the  age  of  15, Froebel who loved nature, become the apprenticeship and study mathematics and botany in Jena. From 1802 to 1805, he worked as a land surveyor. 1.2.5.

He  later  worked  with Pestalozzi's in Switzerland where his ideas further developed; from 1806 Froebel was the live-in teacher for a Frankfurt noble family's three sons. He lived with the three children from 1808 to 1810 at Pestalozzi's institute in Yverdon-Les-Bains in Switzerland.\nFroebel's Carrier in Education In 1811, Froebel once again went back to school in Gottingen and Berlin, eventually leaving without earning a certificate. He became a teacher at the Plamannsche schule(school) in Berlin, a boarding school for boys, and  at the time also a pedagogical and patriotic centre.\nIn  1816,  Froebel  established  a  small  school  at  Griesheim  which  later  on  was  shifted  to klilhav.  In  this  school,  Froebel  developed  his  own  principles  and  methods  of  instruction. After passing through several vicissitudes, this school became a successful institution in a period of ten years. 'Play' and 'art work' were the chief features of the school.\nContribution of Froebel In 1826 he published his main literacy work, 'The Education of Man' (Die Menschenerziehung).  In  this he says, ' the  true  method  of  education  consists  in considering the mind of the child as a whole in which all the parts work together to produce harmonious unity'."

Froebel's great insight was to recognize the  importance  of  the  activity  of  the  child  in  learning.  He  introduced  the concept of 'Free work' into pedagogy and established the 'Game' as the typical from that life took in childhood, and also game's educational worth. Activities in the first kindergarten included singing, dancing, gardening and self directed play with the Froebel gifts. A songbook that he published- 'Mutter-Und Koselie Der' to introduce the young child in the adult world. Last part of his Life. Froebel died on 21 June 1852 in Marienthal, now a constituent community of Schwerin. His views  were  not  accepted  by  German  Government  it  forbade  him  from  establishing  any school. This was a great shock and he could not long survive. Froebel's Educational Philosophy and Principles GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Froebel believed that humans are essentially productive and creative and fulfillment comes through developing these in harmony with God and the world. As a result, Froebel sought to encourage the creation of educational environments that involved practical work and the direct use of materials.\nFrom  1831  to  1836,  Froebel  once  again  lived  in  Switzerland.  In  1831  he  founded  an educational institute in war tense: further from 1835 to 1836 he headed the orphanage in Burgdorf where he published the magazine ' Features of Human Education '. After this he started many schools in Germany. Froebel's Work He dedicated himself almost exclusively to preschool child education and  began manufacturing playing materials in Bad Blankenburg. In 1837 he founded a care, playing and activity institute for small children in Bad Blankenburg. In 1840 he coined the word Kindergarten for the play and activity Institute he had founded for young children, together with Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> He wanted to develop the qualities of cooperation, tolerance and understanding in children  through  teaching.  He  wanted  that  the  education  of  the  child  should  be planned according to his natural aptitudes interests and activities.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Play is Engine of Real learning. He includes that play  is  not  idle behavior but  a  biological  imperative  to  discover how things work. It is pleasurable activity, but biologically purposeful.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Kindergarten was the first organized early childhood educational method. As a keen observer of nature and humanity, Froebel approached human education from both a biological and a spiritual perspective. His innovations includes multiple intelligences (different  learning  styles),  play  based  child  centered,  holistic  education,  parent involvement/ training, educational paper folding, use of music,  games  and movement activities for education.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Principles  of  Development Froebel  asserts,  'Each  individual  must  develop  from within, self active and free, in accordance with the internal law'.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> According  to  Froebel  'The  True method  of  Education  Consists in  considering  the mind of the child as a living whole in which all the parts work together to produce harmonious unity'.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Play and Activity, play is the purest, most important activity of man at his stage, it gives, therefore, Joy, Freedom, Contentment, inner rest and peace with the world, it holds the source of all that is good'.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Creativeness  of  Childhood,  Froebel  proposed  a  new  concept  of  childhood.  He stressed  that  childhood  is  not  merely  a  preparation  for  adulthood.  Childhood  is  a value in itself and possesses it own creation.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Importance of song he advised songs, gestures and construction as the chief means of stimulating the imagination of the child."

The educators by his efforts assist the educand who is developing according to the law of his nature. Froebel's KindergartenIn 1837 Froebel founded his own school and called it 'Kindergarten' or 'Children's Garden' kindergarten  was  a  new  word created  by him  to  express  his  vision  for  early  childhood. 'Children are like tiny flowers; they are varied and need care, but each is beautiful alone and glorious when seen in the community of peers'.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Freedom  to  the  child the  child  should  be  educated  in  free  atmosphere,  freedom means obedience to self imposed law.\nFrobel 's  labeled his approach to education as 'self activity'. This idea allows the child to lead by his or her own interests and to freely explore them. The teacher's role, therefore, was to be a guide rather than lecture. Froebel's Kindergarten is designed:\nTo meet each child's need for \n- \n- \nPhysical activity\n- \nThe development of sensory awareness and physical dexterity.\n- \nCreative expression\n- \nExploration of ideas and concepts\n Froebel's  school  featured  games,  play,  songs,  stories  and  crafts  to  stimulate  imagination and develop physical and motor skills. The materials were divided into two categories:\nThe pleasure of singing\nThe experience living among others\nSatisfaction of the soul.\nGifts: were objects that were fixed in form such as blocks. The purpose was that in playing with the object the child would learn the concept represented by the object.\nOccupations: allowed more freedom and consisted of things that children could shape and manipulate such as clay, sand, beads and string. He gave children:\n- \n- \n Objective of the Kindergarten : In the words of Froebel, 'The objective of a kindergarten is  to  give  the  children  employment  in  agreement  with  their  whole  nature,  to  strengthen their  bodies  to  exercise  their  senses,  to  engage  their  awakening  mind  and  through  their senses to make them acquainted with nature and their fellow creatures.\nrespect for their intellectual and emotional abilities and development.\nin the classroom (symbolically viewed as an extension of a flourishing garden.)\nand that which he needed most as a child.\n18 | P a g e Environment  of  the  Kindergarten:It  is  to  be  that  of  freedom,  play  and  joyan environment which fosters self expression. There are to be no books or fixed intellectual tasks  for  children,  but  training  in  expression  is  to  be  given  in  three  ways:-songs, movements and construction. These three are to go together. When a story is told or read, it is  expressed in song, dramatized  in movement  and  gesture  and  illustrated  by construction from blocks, paper, clay or drawing. Thus the child's imagination and thought\nare encouraged and stimulated by concrete means. His hands and limbs his eyes and other senses are trained. Kindergarten and educational principles: 1. Self Activity as a process by which the individual realizes his own nature and builds up his own world and then unites and harmonizes the two. Some important points regarding activity: i). It should not be vague.\niv) . Self activity may take the form either of work or of play.\nii). It should be a sublimated activity.\nPlay. According to Froebel play is the purest, most spiritual activity of man at this stage. 'It gives, therefore, joy, freedom, contentment, inner rest and peace with the world. It holds the source of all that is good'.\niii). Social atmosphere is essential in order to secure meaningful activities.\nSongs,  gestures  and  construction according  to  him  there  is  a  organic  relationship between songs, gestures and construction. He regarded these as three coordinate forms of expression in the child.\nFirst Gift : it consists of a string of rainbow colored woolen balls, by the aid of which ideas of color,  from  size  and  motion  were  formed  by  the  children.  The occupation  consists  in rolling them about in play."

The child should be made to realize the discipline depends upon his love for orders, good will and mutual understanding. Curriculum: He expressed this in term of activities with some divisions of the curriculum:i) Manual Work ii) Religion and religious instruction. iii) Natural Science and Mathematics iv) Language v) Arts and objects of art. Froebel's Gift: Froebel prepared his Gifts, which form the basis of all modern kindergarten. All of these gifts  was  accompanied  and  cheered  by  appropriate  songs  and  music.  The  activities suggested by these gifts are called occupations. The gifts are given to the child in a certain order.  The  gradation  and  order  elements  of  gifts  are  determined  by  the  principle  of development. The gifts are 20 in number.\nSecond Gift :  It  is  a  solid cube; cylinder, wooden ball, stick and string are used to impart ideas of from, size, sound and movement. The child observes that the cylinder is both stable and movable and that it harmonies both the qualities in one.\nFourth Gift: it consists of the large cubes divided into eight oblong prisms in each of which the length is twice the breadth and the breadth is twice the thickness. This helps the child to construct different kinds of buildings and patterns when combined with the third gift.\nThird Gift :  it  contains  eight  cubes  of  equal  size,  forming,  when  properly  combined,  one perfect  cube.  Properly  applied,  the  combinations  of  these  supply  the  child  with  ideas  of division  into  halves,  quarters  and  eights.  This  gives  way  to  a  limited  extent,  be  used incidentally to teach these letters of the alphabets which do not involve the use of curves. It may teach the whole by careful arrangements, but the real rounding of the alphabetical letters is a later development.\nFifth Gift: It is very much like the third gift. It consists of a large cube divided into twentyseven small cubes, three of when are again divided diagonally into haves and three into quarters. Child can construct many beautiful forms and patterns by combining the third , fourth and fifth gifts.\nSeventh Gift: It  is  also  a set  of  square  and  triangular  tablets  made  of  fine  wood  in  two colors. It provides material for several exercises in geometrical forms and mosaic work.\nSixth Gifts: this is also similar to gift four. There is a large cube divided into eighteen whole and nine small oblong blocks. Still further designs in forms and construction may be made by the child. It is also useful in teaching numbers.\nOther gifts consists of materials, such as performing paper cuttings, threading of beds, mat making embroidery, basket making, wire work, drawing and modeling.\nContribution of Frobel to Education: Froebel was the first to recognize that significant brain development occurs between birth and age 3. His method combines an awareness of human physiology and the recognition that we, at our essence are creative beings. Once early childhood educations become widely adopted, it was the natural starting point for innovations that followed.\nFrobel  applied  spherical  philosophy  to  education  and  it,  rather  than  empirical observation, guided his work, Mind and matter. Although opposites are both subject to the same law of nature in which god, the third element is imminent."

His statement is that 'Play is the self-active representation of the inner from inner necessity'.\n4. Women Education: Froebel's observations of mother are singing to their children. He wanted to help women educate their infants more effectively as a prerequisite for a better society. According to Froebel, entrust the education at pre-primary or pre-basic stage to women teachers who are considered to be more suited for this task of instruction at this stage.\n3. Education  through  Play:  he  introduced  play-way  in  the  activities  of  the  school. Teach children through songs, movements, gestures, dramatization, handwork, etc. In 1843, he published a book entitled Mother's songs, Games and stories. This was his  most popular book; as the title suggests, it described action songs and finger plays (together with their musical notion) wood cut illustrations, and guidance on how to present the songs as well as the meanings that could be derived from them.\n5.

Maria Montessori (1870-1952) The most admired educator Maria Montessori was a doctor by qualification and profession at the start of her Carrier. When she was in the University of Rome's psychiatric clinic saw large  number  children  with  learning  disabilities,  placed  there  for  lack  of other  options. Treatment of these children touched her, and she began to read everything she could find on the education of the children with such disabilities. She disagreed with Rousseau's idea of  unstructured  education  in  the  wilds  of  nature,  she  liked his  ideas  of  developing  the senses before abstract learning taken place. She also studied the work of Pestalozzi and Froebel and adapted them to her own use.\nEducational Interest She was convinced that it was neither education nor medicine that would improve their lives.  She  was  speaking  at  conferences  about  the  need  to  educate  children  with  learning disabilities, and proposed a school along with Froebel's line. She found herself appointed director of a teacher training institute that was a pioneer in the field of special education in Italy.\nMontessori worked as a professor of Anthropology in the University of Rome from 1900 to 1917. She supervised the word of mentally different children and took a keen interest in their  education  also.  Montessori  developed  the  principle  that  was  also  to  inform  her general  educational  programme:  first the  education  of  the  senses,  then  the education  of intellect.  Maria  Montessori  developed  a  teaching  programme  that  enabled  'defective' Children to read and write she thought to teach skills not by having children repeatedly try it, but by developing exercises that prepare them. These exercises would then be repeated: looking becomes reading; touching becomes writing.\nPulling her ideas from Froebel and others, Montessori experimented with teaching materials  and  activities,  succeeding  so  well  that  her  8  year-old  so-called 'defectives' eventually did as well as or better than those labeled 'normal ' in state examinations for reading and writing."

This  house  and  that  followed  are  designed  to  provide  a  good  environment  for children  to  live  and  learn.  An  emphasis  was  placed  on  self  determination  and  self realization. Self realization through independent activity, the concern with attitude and the focus on the educator as the keeper of the environment.\n22 | P a g e Montessori began to conceptualize her own method of applying their educational theories,  which  she  tested  through  hands  on  scientific  observation  of  students  at  the Orthopedic School. Montessori found the resulting improvement in student's development remarkable.

Montessori teaching methods continue the 'Follow the Child' all over the world now.\nThere are 3 stages of learning:\nMontessori Education : 'Montessori is a method of education that is based on self directed activity, hands on learning and collaborative play. In Montessori classrooms Children make creative choices in their learning, while  the classroom  and the teacher offer  age appropriate  activities  to  guide  the  process.  Children  work  in  groups  and  individually  to discover and explore knowledge of the world and develop their maximum potential'. The learning process according to Montessori :\n3. 'Knowing',  processing  the  information  demonstrated  by  the  ability  to  teach  or explain to others, or to express easily. Some important educational views:\n1. Introduction to a concept (by a lesson, a reading, a lecture). 2. Processing  the  information  and  developing  an understanding  of  the  meaning through work, experimentation, creation, this gives the child a real ability to learn and remember what he/she has learned.

In addition, Gandhiji had also realized the vital  importance  of  educating  children  below  7  years  of  age,  which  in  opinion  is  an important  stage  in  the  growth  and  development  of  the  individual.  Gandhiji  focus  on education for children of 7 years which is called pre basic education. Pre basic education: Pre  basic  education  is  the  'education  of  children  under  7  for  a  development  of  all  their faculties  conducted  by  the  school  teachers  in  cooperation  with  the  parents  and  the community in schools and at homes'.

Children need to be given full freedom to act, to move about and to choose their own activities teacher must supervise and guide the child.\nIn  first  two  stages  education  involves  both  mother  and  child.  Opportunities  are provided to the mothers to learn more about new trends and scientific methods of child  rearing  health  and  hygiene  and  mother  craft.  Children  were  given  custodial care and medical attention.\nThe children after 4 years can participate in definite purposeful activities such as cleaning the class room, watering plants, washing vessels, measuring and weighing tins, bringing  water,  drawing  and  painting  and  other  similar  activities.

Rabindranath Tagore was a philosopher, poet, dramatist, teacher essayist and painter of outstanding repute. His philosophy of life was based on the ideals of dedication, patriotism and  naturalism.  Although  he was  an  ideal  philosopher,  but  the  thoughts  of  naturalism, pragmatism and individualism are also reflected in his philosophy.\nValue of Dignity of labor Manual work will have to be the very centre of the whole thing. Useful manual labor, intelligently performed is the means par intelligence for developing the intellect. 1.2.8. Rabindra Nath Tagore (1961-1941) Rabindranath Tagore was a poet and a saint who had through his imagination and in sight, realized the universal soul in himself and in nature. He believed that this realization was the goal of education. He believed that every human being is one who has potentialities of progressing  towards  the  super  human  being,  the  universal  soul.  His  conception  of  the Universal soul before clear imprint of the Gita and Upanishadic philosophies.\nRabindranath Tagore believed that the aim of education is self realization . Principles of self  education : Self  education based  on self  realization  is  as  permanent  as  that  of education. What is most important in this is that the students must have faith in him and in the universal self underlying his own individual self.\nAs  an  Educationist Tagore  visiting  Santa  Barbara  in 1917,  conceived  a  new  type  of university,  he  sought  to  make  'Santiniketan'  the  connecting thread  between  India  and world. Aims of Education according to Tagore: 1. Self  Realization:  Spiritualism  is  the  essence  of  humanism.  Manifestation  of  personality depends upon the self realization and spiritual knowledge of individuals.\nRabindranath Tagore became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for literature for 'Gitanjali', his book of poem. As a humanist, Universalist, Internationalist and strident antinationalist he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.\n2. Intellectual  Development:  He  emphasized  greatly  the  Intellectual  Development  of  the children.

The Ideal school according to Rabindranath Tagore located at a distance of about 100  miles  from  Calcutta.  Later,  this  school  become  'Santiniketan'  and  grew  into  'Visva Bharati'.\nTagore pointed out the great significance of the school environment in the life of children whose  mind,  like  the  tree,  has  the  power  to  gather  food  and  nourishment  from  its surroundings.  The  cultural  atmosphere  in  Santiniketan  keeps  the  mind  sensitive  to  rich racial inheritance, glorious traditions and concentrated wisdom of ages.\nChildren minds are sensitive to the influences of the world. The subconscious minds are active always imbibing some lessons, and realizing the joy of knowing. On December 22, 1901 Rabindranath Tagore started a school at Santiniketan  named  'Brahma Charyasrama' modified on the lines of the ancient Gurukul system. Later it was renamed Visva Bharati, it's symbolic meaning being defined by Tagore as 'where the world makes a\n- home in a nest'.

He maintains that the kind of education, we need in our country, is an education 'proper to the Indian soul and need and temperament and culture that we are in quest of, not indeed something faithful merely to the past, but to the developing soul of India, to her future need to the greatness of her coming self creation, to her eternal spirit'.\nSri Aurobindo wrote a series of articles on education in the 'Karma Yogin during 1909-10 under the title'.

The  idea  of hammering the child into the shape desired by the parent or teacher is a barbarous and ignorant superstition. The mind has to be consulted in its growth. Sri Aurobindo wrote, 'It is wrong and not be ignored and mutilated'.\n3. The Third Principle of Teaching is to work from the near to the far, from the known to the unknown. Man's nature is molded by his soul's past, his heredity and his environment. The past is the foundation, the present is the material and future is the aim and each must find its due and natural place in any national system of education."

Development, by contrast, refers to qualitative and quantitative changes. It may be defined as a progressive series of orderly, coherent changes.

This period is labeled by parents the toy age, problem or troublesome age, as the pre-school age: and by the psychologists as the pre-gang age, the explorative or initiative age. 2.4.

Physical growth is at a slow rate. 2. The  average  annual  height  is  three  inches,  by  the  age  of  six, the  average  child measured 46.6 inches.\n6. The baby teeth begin to be replaced by permanent teeth. 7. The child in pre-school stage develops a variety of motor skills like walking, running, jumping, hopping and climbing. B. Social development:\n3. The average annual increase in weight is 3 to 5 pounds. At the age of six, children weight approximately seven times as much as they did at birth. 4. The arms and legs lengthen and the hands and feet grow bigger.\n5.\nThe muscles become larger, stronger and heavier.\n1.

Some general Implication\nHuman development is a lifelong process of physical behavioral, cognitive and emotional growth and change. It describes the growth of the human throughout the life span from conception  to  death.  A  lot  of  charges take place  at  various  stages  of  life.  Childhood adolescence  and  adulthood.  Throughout  the  stages,  each  individual  develops  attitudes, values and guide choices relationships and understanding.\n2.6.2. Principle of Development and their educational implication\nAll aspects of human growth and development include physical, emotional, social, intellectual perceptual and personality development.\n2.6.1.Differences between Growth and Development:\n'Growth' and 'Development' are often used inter changeably in terminologies. But both are different from each other.\n1. Growth is physical changes in organism. 2. Growth is cellular, Development = 1. Development is over all and progressive changes in the organism. 2. Development is organizational.. 3. Growth is change in shape, form, structure and size of the body 4.Growth stops at maturation, Development = 3. Development is structural and functional changes in body. 4. Development continues till death. , Development = 5. development includes growth. 5. Growth is a part of development, Development = \n6.Growth is quantitative in nature\n6. development is qualitative in nature\nMaturation This means simply changes, which take place as a result of physical growth of Biological change, rather than those, which takes place through experience. Major development in early childhood is the result of maturation learning to walk, talk etc are the example of maturation. It provides the base for the future development.\nKinds of behavior\nThere are two kinds of behavior.\nPhylogenetic\nOntogenetic\nPhylogenetic Behaviors: It refers to those behaviors which are common to human species like walking, talking etc. later more development results from experience.\nOntogenetic Behaviors: It refers to those behaviors which are individually learned on an individual time table.\nPhysical skills can be taught much more quickly and easily to a child, who is at appropriate development level. 2.6.2Principles of Development and their Educational Implications:\nA child who is not taught to walk will nevertheless begin to do so when strength and ability permit, it is a natural consequence of human maturation. But a child, who is capable of the physical skill necessary to swing a racket or write a word will not be able to do so unless shown how.\n- Development is governed by certain principles:1) Development is the product of heredity and environment :  Research studies and investigations have revealed the fact that development is a product of heredity and environment. An individual  inherits  many  physical,  mental  and  personal  qualities from his ancestors but those qualities are greatly influenced by the environment. As presents or teachers are unable to control and change the heredity, they should provide suitable environment for the child, so that there will be proper development.\nTeachers must be very particular about the fact that development is gradual and continuous. They should not accept a child to achieve something suddenly, rather they should encourage the gradual achievement and success of the child.\n2. Development is a continuous Process : Development is a continuous process that takes place at a slow and regular pace. Though for convenience the entire life span is  divided into certain stages, one cannot notice any clear-cut distinction between two consecutive stages. Nothing happens all on a sudden. For example we cannot say exactly when a child has developed the power of speech.\n3. Development of various traits are correlates :  it  is  clear from research findings that various traits are correlated. If a child is having a high IQ, he will generally, have good physique; and  the backward  children  generally, have various physical handicaps.\n3. As  the development  of  various  traits  is correlated,  the  school  should  provide different curricular and co curricular activities so that there will be development in all aspects of the children.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nDevelopment proceeds from general to specific: Development occurs from mass activity to differentiation. The newly born baby, at first moves his body as a whole. The gradually he/she make finer movements. The baby also produces some general babbling sounds first; and then gradually learns to speak  specific  words.  Teacher  should  take  into  consideration  this  principle  of development while teaching. Developments Follow a pattern: Development  takes  place  in  a  sequential  order;  it  is  a  step-by-step  process.  The physical development follows two sequences:"
  },
  {
    "id": "21. Paper_19_37",
    "context_enriched_content": "Structure:\n- (ii). Proximo-distal  sequence -the  growth  process  from  the  central  part  of  the peripheral parts of the body, i.e. the spinal cord develops first and then the outward development takes place.\n- (i) Cephalo-Caudal Sequence - The body grows from head region downwards. That means the distant part of the body from the head, the late is its growth.\nIf the teacher finds any abnormality in the pattern of development in any child, the case should immediately be referred to the specialist. Rates of development of different aspects are different: Different parts of the body and different mental aspects develop at different rates. For example, the brain attains its maximum size around the age of six to eight years; the  hands  and  legs  attain  their  maximum  size  and  strength  by  sixteen  to  twenty years; general intelligence reaches the peak between sixteen to eighteen years and so on.\nIf the teacher has the knowledge of the rate of development of a particular child he can easily control the behaviour of the child.\nThe school should provide learning materials and activities that will facilitate the development of different aspects at the proper time. Development can be predicated: The rate of development of each child is approximately constant throughout.  So it is possible  to  predict  the  development  of  any  particular  aspect  of  any  child  at  any particular time.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\nRate of Development is not even throughout: During infancy and early years both the physical and mental growth are more rapid than during the later years of life. The school should realize the importance of the early  years  of  the  child's  life.  The  preschool  and  early  school years  should  be provided  with  enjoyable  and  productive  experiences,  which  will  facilitate  the learning as well as the development of the child. Individual difference in development: Each  child  has  his  own  rate  of  development.  There is  wide  range of  differences among the individuals in the development of various physical and mental aspects. The  teacher should take into consideration the individual differences  while preparing instructional materials and providing other activities in school. Revision is a feature of development: When a child passes from one stage to the next, he sometimes reverts back to the earlier behavior. This happens due to the lack of mastery over the new behaviors. Such simple deviations from the normal behaviour should be considered as usual and should not be seriously in the school. Spiral and non linear development: This  principle  implies  that  the  development  of  the  child  is  not  in  a  straight  line (linear) but is in the form of a cork-screw (spiral). He advances in his development in one period but takes rest in the following period. This enables him to consolidate his development.\nSpiral Development of Child\n12.\n15.\n2. Physical growth and maturation prepares the stage on which learning occurs: The  materials  an  individual's  learns,  the  speed  with  which  he  learns  it;  and  the ability to retain it, all depend on physical growth and maturation.\nPrinciple of struggle: While  the  child  is  developing  up  towards  maturity  there  are  conflicting  impulses and demands. The child struggles against these in his striving for maturity. 13. Indigenous Motivation is the principle of Development: Child matures in his capacities of doing, thinking and feeling. He has an impulse to put them to use and he does it whole heartedly. This has been described by Jersild as ' Indigenous Motivation '. 14. Anticipation is the principle of Development: The child in his/her process of development also uses his capacity of self repair. He modifies his behavior and even habits keeping in view what is going 'to become' in future. Thus he consciously anticipates his future direction of development. Interrelation is the principle of development: It  is  observed  that  the  growth  and  development  in  various  aspects  like  physical, mental, social etc are inter related and independent. Growth and development of the child in one aspect leads to the development in other aspects as well. 2.6.3. Some General Educational Implications: The  educational implication  of  each of  the  principles  of  development  has been mentioned above. The general educational implications can be summarized below. 1. Development and learning are closely related: Development determines how learning should proceed. If the child is forced to learn a material when he has not developed to the stage to learn the particular material, the learning becomes superficial."

Emphasis on Doing: 'Doing' helps in the development of mental, physical and social skills.\n10. Aspects  of  satisfaction  of curiosity :  Children  are  curious  to  learn  and  respond with interest to new things.\n9. Due recognition :    For  proper development, all children need adequate praise and recognition for their work.\n8.

Hence it is to be accepted to your child unconditionally.\nFriendship\n3. Respect :  A  child needs to have self respect and to be self-respected. Praise your child whenever he does something right to boost his self confidence.\n5. Love : the emotional support and the love of his parents stimulate the child's mental and physical growth-shower him/her with love and tender care.\n4.  Belonging: Everyone  hopes  to  be  part  of  a  group.  It  is  the  same  with  your  child.  He wants  to  have  a  place  in  a  group.  If  he  is  rejected  or  bypassed  it  will  affect  his  healthy development.\n6. Achievement: it is the motive of your child to learn something and to achieve success. Provide positive reinforcement in his quest for knowledge.\n7. Friendship: it is natural for a child to make friends. Encourage your child to socialize so that he learns to get along with others in a normal and healthy situation. All the above psychological needs promote a positive impact on the growth of the child. 2.9. Physiological needs of a child: According to Maslow , a child's first need is physiological.

Principles of development According to Piaget: Jean Piaget (1952-1980) was a Swiss developmental psychologist. He developed one of the most comprehensive theories of cognitive development. He developed genetic epistemology a concept which refers to study of developmental changes in the process of knowing and in the organization of knowledge. According to him cognitive development means how knowledge is acquired and developed through successive stages and at various age levels.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Assimilation means  the  fitting  of  new  information  into  previously  established cognitive structure (schemes)\nMental Process: in Piaget's theory all cognition takes place due to three processes. They are:\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Equilibrium means  optimal  level  of  intellectual  functioning  taking  place  when there  is  a  balance  between  assimilation  and  accommodation.  The  cognitive structure  changes  from  one  stage  to  another  by  the  process  of  equilibration, maintaining balance between the child and his changing environment. These 3 processes together facilitate adaptation is an ongoing process:\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Accommodation means the alteration of existing cognitive structures (schemes) in response to new information.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Adaptation is an inborn tendency to adjust to the demands of environment through assimilation and accommodation.\nGLYPH<UNKNOWN> Organization the  process  by  which  children  combine  existing  schemes  into  new and more complex intellectual structure. 2.13.1.Stages of Cognitive Development Piaget (1970) suggested that children throughout the world proceed through a series of four stages in a fixed order.

Pre operational stages (2-7years) According to Piaget, the pre operational stage is a period from 2 to 7 years of age which is characterized by language development. During this stage the child requires the ability to form mental images of objects and events; and thus begin to think symbolically. This stage is further subdivided into two: (a) Pre conceptual Phase (2 to 4 years) (b) The Intuitive Phase (4 to 7 years) (a) Pre conceptual Phase (2 to 4 years): During this period the child develops the ability to identify and classify objects.  Semiotic functionability to use symbols \nImitation.\n- \n- \nOne way logic\nDiffered Imitation\nSymbolic Play\nTransductive Reasoning:  Child reasons from the particular to the particular.\n(b) Intuitive Phase (4-7 years): the child in the intuitive sub stage lacks understanding of relational terms and ability to sterilize objects. 3. Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 12 years): According to Piaget , the concrete operational period from 7 to 12 years is characterized by logical  thinking  and  loss  of  egocentrism.

Moral and Aesthetic Development\n2.13.3. Physical & Motor Development Children begin developing at birth and continue to adulthood. The successful completion of developmental milestones helps the child reach full potential.\nA  child  develops  rapidly  in  this  stage.  This  period  brings  dramatic  changes  in  body  and brain  of  the  child.  It  supports  the  motor,  perceptual  and  intellectual  capacities.  The\nlanguage begins with the first intimate ties with others. Infancy spans the first year of the child and todler hood, the second year. The period of childhood takes place between 2 to 11 year.\nDuring  Early  childhood,  the  growth  is  even.  Through  it  is  rapid,  it  is  not  as remarkable  as  in  infancy.  From  age  2  to  6  year,  the  body  becomes  longer  and  learner. During this period the child grow in average, 3 or 4 inches in height per year. Motor skills start  refining  and  children  become more self- controlled and self sufficient. Thought and language increases and sense of morality becomes evident. The arms and legs lengthen out, the  lower  part  of  the  face  grow  rapidly.  During  this  time  there  is  sufficient  motor development.  The  child  is  able  to  perform  motor  activities  as  balancing,  climbing  and throwing a ball. This is the best period when child can be trained in different motor skills. The young child is happy to repeat a n activity involving his muscles. During Middle Childhood (6-11 years) During  this  period  children  learn  about  wider  world  and  experience  new  responses. Improved  athletic  abilities,  participation  in  organized  games  with  rules,  more  logical thought process mastery of basic literacy skills and advances in self understanding.\nDuring Infancy the physical growth is most rapid. There is noticeable change in the size and shape of the child. At birth the average weight of an infant is 6.3 pounds and height is  18  inches.  At  the  end  of  the  second  year,  he  is  about  32  to  34  inches  high  and  of  a considerable weight. During this period the child learns to crawl, stand and walk. He can have  the  feelings  of  pain,  temperature  and  pressure  due  to  the  development  of  sense organs.\nDuring this period the child appears more like an adult. The arms and legs grow faster than the trunk and the child appears tall and thin. Child loses milk teeth and permanent teeth begin to appear. Muscular coordination is further refined. During Adolescence (11-18 years) The second stage in which child  develops very rapidly after infancy  is adolescence. This period initiates the transition to adulthood. Puberty leads to an adult sized body and sexual maturation.\nMotor Development :  defined as the development of strength speed and accuracy in the use  if  muscular  parts  of  the  body  such  as  arms  eyes,  legs  and  neck  muscles.  Motor development is closely related with emotional, mental physical and social development.\nDevelopment of Large Gross Muscle Coordination: It  implies  developing  control  over  the  movement  of  large  muscles  of  the  body  such  as thighs,  legs,  arms  etc. This  helps  later  in  life,  particular  in  activities  like  sports,  dancing, gymnastics, dramatics etc."

Emotional development The world 'emotion' is derived from a Latin word 'emovere' which means the stirred up or the excited state of body and mind. P.T. young defined emotion as 'an acute stimulation of the individual as a whole, psychological in origin, involving behavior, conscious experience and  visceral  functioning'.  The  definition  makes  it  quite  clear  that  emotion  is  an  intense experience which moves individual to action. It causes psychological and bodily changes and provokes behavior. There are two types of emotions; the pleasant emotions, such as joy, happiness, affection etc; and the unpleasant emotions such as fear, anger and jealousy etc. An emotion always is aroused by a certain stimuli which may be any event, object or people and continues so long as the stimulus continues.\nGarrison is  of  the  opinion  that  the  ' Infant  is  poorly  endowed  emotionally.  But  the  infant sometimes  shows behaviors that  they  seem  to  have  an  emotional  quality'. According  to\nWatson emotion  of  fear,  anger  and  love  can  be  identified  even  in  very  young  infants. However, the emotions of infants are uncoordinated, undifferentiated, diffused and gross'. As the infant advances in years various emotions begin to differentiate.\nThe atmosphere in both school and home should be as free as possible, so that the child could freely manifest and express his/her emotions. Repression of emotions leads to control in expression of emotions and it is dangerous for the development of the child. Milestones of Emotional Development:\nThe emotional element is present in infants it can be seen from crying and vigorous movements   of the child's body parts. As the child develops and passes to higher stage of life, the emotional pattern can be determined with increasing precision and accuracy. In the process of emotional, development, the child gradually evolves definite patterns of reaction to stimuli that cause emotional reaction. Emotional Development in Childhood: This  development  in  childhood  is  influenced  by  family,  peers,  school  and  community.  A specific  pattern  of behavior is  formed  regarding  adults  and  peers  with  whom  the  child comes into contact.

Social Intellectual Development: 'it can be defined as the progressive improvement through directed activity, of the individual  in  the  comprehension  of  social  heritage  and  the  formation  of  flexible  conduct patterns of reasonable conformity with this heritage 'FF powers adopt to socially accepted behavior patterns. Family, friends, society and culture directly or indirectly pass this learning to the children. Children build a sense about themselves and their social roles, through their relationships with others.\nSocial  development  is  the  progressive  development  by  means  of  which,  the  child maintains  order  and  system  in  his/her  relation  with  others  in  the  community.  During different stages of development, social circumstances, relations with others and expectations undergo constant change.

He is unable to distinguish between what is  good  and  what  is  bad;  because  he  has  no  conscience  and  no  scale  of  values.  He performs  some  wrong  acts  unintentionally  due  to  his  ignorance,  and  inability  to distinguish between good and bad acts. Hurlock is of the view that since the child has no conscience it is of no value to teach him moral behavior and moral concepts.\n4.

The  word 'Moral'  has  been  derived  from  a  Latin  word  'Mores'  which  means  manners,  customs, and folkways. So moral behavior refers to behavior in conformity with moral code of the society."

Kohlberg believed that young children behave morally because they fear authority and try to avoid punishment'.\nPre Conventional Level :  The  child  of  first  and  basic  level,  the  conventional  level,  in concerned with avoiding punishment and getting needs met. This level has two stages; and applies the children up to 10 year of age.\nHe  felt  that  moral  development  was  a  slow  process  and  evolved  overtime,  he  has explained six stages of development.\n- (1). Punishment Obedience Stage: Children obey rules because they are told to do so, by an authority figure (Parent or Teacher) and they fear punishment if they do not follow rules.\nConventional  Level :  This  level  broadens  the  scope  of  human  wants  and  needs. Children  in  this  level  are  concerned  about  being  accepted  by  others  and  living  up  to their expectations. This stage begins around age 10 but lasts well into adulthood.\n- (2). Individual, instrumentation and Exchange Stage: Child follows the rules if there is a known benefit to him or her. Children at this stage are very concerned with what is fair.\n- (3). 'Good  boy  &  Good  Girl', Interpersonal  Conformity Stage- Children  do  the  right things because it is good for the family, peer group, team, school or institutions. They understand the concepts of trust, loyalty and gratitude, morality is acting in accordance to what the social group says is right and moral.\nPost  Conventional  Level :  some  teenagers  and  adults  move  beyond  conventional morality  and  enter  morality  based  on  reason,  examining  the  relative  values  and opinions of the groups with which they interact.\n- (4). Law and order or Social System and Conscience stage: Children and adults at this stage abide by the rules of the society in which they live. These laws and rules become the back bone for all right and wrong actions. Children and adults feel compelled to do their duty and show respect for authority.\n- (5). Social Contact and individual Rights stage: individual in this stage understand that codes of conduct are relative to their social group.\n- (6). The  principled  conscience  or  the  universal  ethical  principles stage: Individuals examine the validity of society's laws and govern themselves by what they consider to be universal moral principles. Usually involving equal rights and respect. They obeys rules that fall in line with these universal principles.\nDuring Childhood Period: The moral concepts are specific in the beginning and are related to particular situations. The child is able to distinguish between right and wrong in simple situations. But when the  child  is  about  8  or  9  years  old  he  develops  more  generalized  moral  concepts towards the 11 or 12 year the moral concept of the child oriented towards authority, law,  duty  and  maintaining  the  status  quo.  But  the  moral  values  of  the  child  go  on changing as he encounters with more and more people. School Programme for developing Moral Values of Various Kinds:\n2. Social service programmes. 3.

Out of these 3 direct teaching and identification are not only the best methods but also the most widely used. Trial and Error Learning:\nThe teachers and educators, the supervisors and administrators and above all the parents must try their best to promote value oriented education. Phases of Moral Development: Moral development takes place in two distinct phases:\nChildren learn to behave in a socially approved way by trial and error, they do so by trying out  one  pattern  of behavior to see  of  it  conforms  to  social  standards  and  wins  social approval for them. Direct Teaching: Children  must  first  learn  to  make  correct  specific  response  in  specific  situations.  If  the objective  aspects  of  different  situations  are  similar  children  transfer  the  patterns  of behavior they have learned in one situation to other similar situations. On the other hand, when these objective aspects are different, children will fail to see how, what they learned in one situation applies to another situation.\n(2) Development of Moral Concepts: The second phase of moral concepts consists of the learning of moral concepts or the principles of right and wrong in an abstract verbal form.\nIdentification: when children identify with people they admire they imitate the patterns of behavior they observe in these people. Identification as a source of learning moral behavior becomes increasingly important as children grow older and rebel against discipline in the home and school.\nPreschool children are in capable of abstract thinking; they define 'good behaviour' of specific acts such as 'obeying mother' or 'helping others' and 'bad behavior' in terms of not doing these things. At the age of 8 or 9 year, the concepts of the children become more generalized. They realize for example that 'Stealing is Wrong' rather than that is 'wrong to steal a ball'. Moral concepts reflect social values are known as 'moral values'. The moral values of children are not static, they tend to change as they associate with more people and with people whose values differ from those they have learned at home. 2.13.7. Aesthetic Development: Aesthetic is the awareness and appreciation of pleasant sensory experiences including the ability to perceive, respond and sensitive to one's natural environment. The way children learn  in  their  early  years  is  important  and  will  indirectly  influence  on  their  later development and learning and to bring children's potential to the maximum, they must be given the opportunities to explore and experiment in the different areas of learning and aesthetic learning is one of them.\nStimulating environment created for such activities will enhance children's learning and  thinking.  Providing opportunities to  the  children,  express  their thoughts,  ideas  and feelings  freely  through  art,  music,  drama  not  only  enable  the  children  to  express  things\nAesthetic  is  connected  with  beauty and  the  study  of  beauty.

Learning to understand, use and enjoy language is the critical first step in Literacy and the basis for learning to write.\n2.13.11 Language development Chart\nLanguage is an important skill that allows a person to communicate. A child begins to develop language even before she can use words, as seen by a baby who cries to get her needs meet. Language development is important to a child in order to adequately exchange information with others in a meaningful way. 2.13.9. Language development in Children It is the best way to encourage the child's speech and language development is to talk together frequently and naturally.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Talking  with  the  babyWhen  the  baby  starts  babbling  babble  back  with  similar sounds.

Broadly speaking language performs the following functions:1. Language helps to communicate ideas to others.\n2.\nLanguage helps in the formation of concepts.\n(2) Helpful in the development of oral expression\n(3) Helpful in the development of reading skills.\n3. Language helps in the analysis of complex wholes. 4.

Even more importantly, they could understand that addition increases the numerosity of the set of items or objects, while subtraction does the opposite'.\n- Math and number  awareness involves a variety of skills, including (1)  Numeral identification (recognizing all 10 numerals from 0 through 9 and knowing each numeral's name),  (2)  Counting,  (3)  one  to  one  correspondence,  (4)  counting  on  (5)  patterning recognition and creation: and sorting and classifying. Importance of Strong Math and Number skills: GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Basic  mathematics  and  number  concepts  utilized  on  a  preschool  or  kindergarten classroom  set  the  foundation  for  learning  more  advanced  math  concepts.  Early exposure  to  math  and  number  activities  will  promote  child's  comfort  with  these skills.  Also  additional opportunities to  practice  these  skills  will  increase  child's confidence  when  working  with  math  and  number  concepts  and  will  lead  him  to believe he is 'Good at Math'. If a child does not become comfortable with math and number concepts at a young age, child will lack confidence in his abilities and may become  hesitant  as  more  advanced  math  concepts  are  introduced.  When  this happens,  he  may  default  to  believing  he  is  'Bad  at  Math'.  As  children  grow  they learn abstract concepts like goodness, honesty and kindness etc, GLYPH<UNKNOWN> The process of concepts consists of the following elements:\n- (1) Experience (exploration) (2) Abstraction.

Exploration from Birth: When babies first  interact,  they  don't  have  words  to  describe  what  they  encounter.  But they do absorb information through their senses. A new born also begins to to hear sounds in the womb and can distinguish her/his mother's voice from other voices at birth.

Aesthetic  experience  is  also  closely  related  to Maslow's concept of peak experience (Maslow 1968). In this experience, attention is fully engaged and focused on a particular object, while the object is seen as detached from its every day purpose and usefulness.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Become an object - Help children identify with and see the wonder in objects by pretending to that objects.

Aesthetics refers to the love of beauty, criteria for judging beauty and to individual tasted (Stephanie Feeney and Eva Moravcik). Aesthetic experiences with visual arts, poetry and storytelling as integral to language and literacy learning are presented. Some Ideas of Aesthetic Experiences GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Think  nature -For  example  study  a  leaf,  look  at  the  veins,  the  colour,  the  colour inside, those colours, shape within the shape, microspic line, textures, and look for pattern.\nfeel,  look,  possibly  smell  or  even  taste  like  on  every  day  object.

Importance and Requirements. Good  Nutrition  In  the  early  years  is  vital.  Children's  early  experiences  of  food  play  an important  part  in  shaping  later  eating  habits  and  good  eating  habits  support  healthy growth and development. Nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food and its utilization in the body. A preschool child must be provided with nourishing food so as to develop his body and strength. Food components which provide nourishments to the body are called nutrients. A verity of food stuff according to their nutritive values is required in definite quantities for a particular person for his or her proper growth. In case the person is not provided with this diet, there will be malnutrition in the body.\n3.1.3.\nBalanced diet for children.\nProblems caused by not eating balanced diet.\nOur  body  normally  requires  6  types  of  food  materials  for  its  normal  growth  and maintenance.  These  are Carbohydrates,  fats,  proteins,  minerals,  vitamins and water . These food materials are required in different quantities for discharging different functions of  the  body.  As  per  the  statement  given  by Sir  Stanly  Davidson  and  others ,  a  normal human body is composed of different materials:-\nCarbohydrates\n- 1.5%\nProtein\n-17.0%\nMinerals\nFats\n-13.8%\nWater\n-61.6%\n-6.1%\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Constructive  foods -These  are  rich in nutrients out of  which  the  body  is constructed. The predominant materials composing the soft parts of the body- the muscles,  brain,  liver,  intestines  etc  is  protein  a  substance  of  a  complex  structure whose essential element is nitrogen.\nA major portion of body is water. In  order  to  maintain  proper  state  of  nutrition  the  diets  must  contain  sufficient  of  all  the nutritive factors (nutrients) which the body requires. There are 3 classes of these, namely energy giving, constructive and protective. 3.1. Importance of nutrition & requirement GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Energy giving foods - Supply the body with the materials which it needs to produce heat, muscular work and to keep going the basic activities of the life such as heart beat and respiration.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Protective  foodsArouse  from  the  fact  that  disorganized  growth  and  bodily function and actual disease where found to result from deficiencies of the protective factors in the diet. These are so far as is known at present the mineral elements and the vitamins & all foods which contain relatively large amounts of these nutrients are known as protective.\n- Why Nutrition is Important? GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Nutrition  is  a  process  which  includes  taking  food  into  stomach,  its  digestion  and assimilation. GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Nutrition varies with age, sex and types of occupation. GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Adequate nutritional diet is called balanced diet. GLYPH<UNKNOWN> GLYPH<UNKNOWN>\n- With few exceptions, all foods are in some measures energy-giving, constructive and protective. Example:- milk is not only the best of constructive but also, it is best in the protective class and a good source of energy.\nSome diseases are caused by nutritionally poor diet.\nPoverty and ignorance are the major causes of under nutrition or malnutrition."

This  imbalance  in  nutrients can  weaken  the  person's immune system and body and make them more susceptible to illness. Malnutrition can also cause delays in a child's physical and mental development.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> This  occurs  when  people  are  not  eating  enough  food,  or  when  the  food  they  are eating  does  not  contain  well  balanced  nutrients.  WHO estimates  that  one  out  of every three people is suffering from a deficiency in one or more essential nutrients.\nMalnutrition is often divided into two different types, under malnutrition and over nutrition. These  two  different  types  vary  by  what  the  person  is  consuming,  how  it  is influencing their bodies. 3.2 Under Nutrition & it's result 1. Under Nutrition occurs when a person consumes a diet that does not meet the necessary requirements for the amount of essential nutrients or calories a person needs to remain healthy.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> There are 3 common deficiencies that people suffer from, Lack of Vitamin A in diet is a large problem which results in many cases of blindness in children early year.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Deficiency  in  iron  cause a  person  to  become  anemic  which  can  result  in  fatigue increased risk of infection and increased risk of hemorrhaging during childbirth.\n- GLYPH<UNKNOWN> Iodine  deficiency  is  also  very  common,  with  one-third  of  the  human  population suffering from a lack of Iodine. It is important for proper function of thyroid gland which  is  responsible  for  producing  hormones  that  manage  the  body's  metabolic\nrate. A lack of iodine can cause stunted growth, mental delays and the creation of goiters, which the base of the neck become swollen.\nIn most cases, people who suffer from over nutrition gain excess weight and this can cause many serious problems to the human body. It can also lead to increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, type2 diabetes and even some cancers. Specific Deficiency: Specific deficiency is a type of malnutrition that results from a diet that contains negligible or none at all of a specific nutrient and leads to specific deficiency symptoms.\nOver Nutrition Over  nutrition  occurs  when  a  person  consumes  a  diet  that  exceeds  the  necessary requirements for the amount of essential nutrients."

Child  care  programme,  child  education,  Day  care centers crèches, Anganwadi,  etc  are  organized  with  giving  emphasis  on  the  health  and  nutrition  of  the preschool child. These pre-schools also look after the material care. Pre primary schools are basically concerned with the education of children of the age group of 2½ or 3 to 5 or 6.\nFor  example  KLAY  schools  are  a  chain  of  high  ended  preparatory  schools  catering  to preschools and providing day- care and after school services. KLAY schools are set up by founding years- A multi platform education services organization. It is the best play school in India caters to an age group of 1-10 years. It is believed that children's minds in their formative years are like clay (name is inspired by this) and need to be provided the right environment to flourish.\nPre-primary schools have been opened under different names.  Among  the important names are:\nDay care for children is now available at safe and secure schools that offer care and also academics of for children. Day care is also about having the best lessons for  kids via an interactive syllabus.

All  teachers  must\nhave an  early  childhood  undergraduate  or  graduate  degree  and  Montessori certification.

The  approach  encourages exploration and focuses on the importance of community and self expression. Open ended and child-led, students learn through Art projects and activities that reflect their  ideas  and  interests.  There  is  no  formal  curriculum  teacher  training  or credentialing because Reggio Emilia is not a set method, but an educational theory and practice.\n2. Waldrof -This  approach  is  based  on  the  teaching  of  Austrian  writer  of  Rudolf Steiner. Waldrof preschools strive to nurture a child's spirit soul and body and to focus  on  the  child's  interests.  It  involves  creative  hands  on  group  learning  with  a focus on rhythmic repetition in a supportive environment. This approach strives to generate  a  strong  inner  enthusiasm  for  learning  and  develop  children's  innate abilities  and  talents.  Instruction  is  teacher-directed  and  every  teacher  must  be Waldrof certified.\n4. High Scope :  the  high  scope  curriculum  uses  a  carefully  designed  approach  called active participatory learning. Children learn actively by having hands on experiences with their surroundings, and learning is supported through consistent daily  routines  and  well  organized  classrooms.  It  takes  an  academic  start  with planned experiences in the basic subjects of math, reading and science. It is based on past and current child development research.\n6. Parent Co-Ops : This is the approach where parents are to be directly involved with their  children's  school  experience,  consider  a  cooperative  pre-school. Parents  are actively involved with their little one's education on a daily basis and work closely with the classroom teachers. This hands on approach allows  parents and children to  learn  together  in  a  nurturing  environment  with  a  focus  on  teaching  preschools how to corporate and resolve conflicts.(copyright @ 2013 meredith corporation)\n5. Bank Street :  this development approach is based on the educational philosophy of John Deway -the focus is on a child's mental, social, emotional and physical growth in this  programme the  child  is  an  active  learner  and  gains  knowledge  about  the world through experience. Students set the learning pace, and the teacher serves as a guide. Comparable to play based learning, this approach teaches lessons through hands on activities, such as building blocks, puzzles, clay and dramatic play.\nDifferent play school centers offer different things for the children: There are different types of preschool centers to choose from which deciding where to send your child. There are centers that focus mostly on childcare, where others are more focused on getting your child ready for school. Other centers allow the children to grow through play based learning. 5.1.1. Something we should look for in the best preschool Play  based  learningpreschoolers  are  too  young  to  learn  by  the  traditional  method  of teaching.  Instead  you  should  find  a  pre-school  center  that  teaches  children  through  play based learning.\nSome pre-school centers implement this way of teaching is by setting up specific learning sections in a classroom that will help a child explore, discover, and learn in different areas. These  learning centers set  up  will  allow  children  to  learn  independence,  encourage involvement and help develop social skills. 5.1.2.

Entry access to the center is limited to only those who are supposed to be there. Whether parents must use a swipe card to get in, buzz a desk for entrance, or use a touch screen and finger printing, in order to access entry to the day care."

A Brief Description of important Techniques and Tools Based in Evaluation in ECCE Programme . Anecdotal Record An anecdotal Record is the observed behavior of a child. It has been defined by Randall as 'a  record  of  some  significant  item  of  conduct,  a  record  of  an  episode  in  the  life  of  the student; a word picture of the student in action, something which may be significant about his personality'.\nNote: In ECCE, more stress should be laid in the areas of co-scholastic development of the learners, several pre-primary schools tend to ignore this aspect and they lay more emphasis on scholastic areas.\nAn anecdotal record is a running description of actual example of behavior of the learner as observed by the teacher.\nA Specimen of an Anecdotal Record\nObserver\nName of the school\nDate and Place\nName of the learner observed\nClass_________________\nObjective Description Comments of the Observer Place: Play-field\nObjective description : Place: Library Corner\nI have often found Shyam in the play-field sitting idle.\nPrecautions  in  the  Use  of  Anecdotal  Record:  we  cannot  set  any  limit  on  the  number  of anecdotes to be recorded. It depends upon the time at the disposal  of the teachers. The flowing points should be considered in condition with these records:\nObjective  Description:  I  have  been  finding  Shyam  day  after day  in  the  library  reading magazines,  yet  he  never  has  time  to  correct  error  or  to  work  carefully  on  English assignments.\n1. Anecdotal  records  supplement  other  records  and  should  not  be  considered  as substitutes.\n4. Behavior, whether it is favorable, unfavorable or neither favourable nor unfavorable to the learner, should be recorded .\n2. The  objective  description  of  the  behavior  should  not  be mixed  up  with  the subjective comments.\n5. The facts presented in all the anecdotes must be sifted and arranged so that they may be studied in relation to one another.\n3. Any significant behavior, be it in the classroom, in the school or outside the school, should be recorded.\n6. The record should be regarded as confidential. It should not fall into irresponsible hands.\n- Values and Uses of Anecdotal Records: 1. They provide specific and exact descriptions of personality and minimize generalizations. 2. They are very helpful in understanding the learner's behavior in diverse situations.\n6. The new members of the staff may use these records and acquaint themselves with the learner's assets and limitations. 7. These records aid in clinical services.\n4. They provide data for the learner to use in self-appraisal. 5. A summary of these records is valuable for forwarding with a learner when he is transferred from one school to another.\n3.\nThey provide a continuous record.\n8.\nThey stimulate teachers to use the records\nQuestionnaire: It consists of a set of written questions to be responded by the learners. The focus is on obtaining information about the attitude and interests of the learners. At the ECCE  stage,  the learner may  be  asked  to  write  'yes'  or 'no' for each question/statement."

    "context_enriched_content": "An Outline of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation ECCE\nInterview:  an  interview  is  face  to  face  conversation  between  the  learner  and  the teacher. This tool enables the teacher to secure some evidence concerning the growth of interests and change in attitudes, etc. of the learner. Observation: Taken up separately.\nRating Scale: By rating is meant the judgment of the teacher about the learner. In rating, the expression of opinion relating to the trait of a child is systematized.\nLearner Products. The actual products made by the learners provide useful evidence of their attitudes, interests and skills.\nAt the ECCE stage, a learner is usually rated on a 5 point scale: very Good/Excellent/Average/Good /Needs improvement It is usually denoted by putting 'stars'.\nPsychological Tests: Several types of psychological tests are used to measure learner's aptitudes and interests, etc.\nSociometry is a method of discovering, describing and evaluating the social status. i.e. acceptance or rejection of the learner in the group.\nCheck list: a check list in evaluation consists of a series of sequential statements used for recording whether a characteristic   is present or absent in the learner. It is used by the teacher usually in recording observational results. Observational as a tool of Evaluation:\nThe  physicians  and  the  psychologists depend  heavily  on  what  they  observe. Rousseau's  advice  to  the  educator  is  'Watch  nature  long  and  observe  your  pupil carefully before you say a word to him'. Meaning of Observation:\nIntroduction:  Observation is  one  of  the  oldest  tools  that  man  has  made  use  of  in  his daily life  to  meet several situations. Even now it is our common experience to notice that farmers feel the breeze, watch the sky, moon and stars all to determine what the weather  is  like  to  be  and  what  season  is  approaching  so  that  they  undertake agricultural operation like sowing, etc. accordingly.\nFollowing definitions of observation help to understand the meaning of observation. In the words  of  good, 'observation deals with the overt behavior  of  persons  in appropriate situations'.\n'observation  has  been  defined  as  'measurement  without  instruments'.  In  education, observation  is  the  most  commonly  employed  of  all  measurement  techniques.  In  the present  as  well  as  in  the  past,  students  have  been  labeled  as  good,  fair  or  poor  in achievement and lazy or diligent in study, etc. on the basis of observation. Similarly, teachers have listened to speeches and ranked students 1,2,3 and so on. Notes:  'What', 'Why', 'Whom', 'How' and 'When' of observation. 1. What to Observe? Specific activities or units of behavior to observed must be clearly defined.\nGoode and Hate State. 'Observation includes the most casual uncontrolled experiences as well as most exact film records of laboratory experimentation '.\n2. Why to Observe?  The aim of observation should be very clear. 3. Whom to Observe? An appropriate group of learners should be selected in case it is a research work not related to classroom. In the case of normal teaching, the teacher observes the learners to have the necessary knowledge about them.\n4. Who  is  to  Observe?  The  teacher  of  the  counsellor  must  prepare  himself  for  the observation to be conducted effectively. He must free himself from any bias.\n5. How  to  Observe?  Instruments  and  forms  of  observations  should  be  prepared carefully and kept handy.\n6. When  to  Observe?  Specific  conditions  under  which  observations  are  to  be  made should be determined scientifically. 5.4.2. Requisite of Good Observation :\nBehavior is a reflection of personality: it must be observed very carefully, intelligently and scientifically as observation of behavior has been recognized as basic to other techniques.\nThe subjective element  is very prominent  in observation. To eliminate  the subjective  element,  reliance  should  be  placed  or  a  large  number  of  individual observations or on the observations made by a large number of observers.\nCharacteristics of Good Observation As a tool good observation is based on:\nA. Proper Planning of Observation: Specific activities or units of behavior to be observed must be clearly defined.\nI.\nProper planning\nIII. Proper recording\n2.\nII.\nProper execution\nIV. Proper interpretation\n1.\nAn appropriate group of subjects should be selected for observation.\n6."

Moreover,  this  is  likely  to  distract  the subjects.\nD.\nFacts may be recorded soon after the observation is over. This is helpful as this does not distract the mind of the subjects.

The observer plays a dual role, i.e. observer as well as participant.\n3.\nHe many assume the role of an attentive listener or a fully fledged participant.\n4.\nIt is a flexible type of observation.\n5.\nIt gives more reliable results.\n2. It is very helpful in recordings and studying the behavior of the members of the group in detail.\n6. It is economical and helps in findings out delicate hidden and minute facts. B. Non Participant Observation 1. The observer takes a position so that his presence does not disturb the movements/ activities of the group.\n3. This method can be used with children of all ages; of course, the younger the child, the  easier  it  is  to  observe  him.  This  method  has  been  found  very  useful  with  shy children.\n4. It  can  be  used  with  a  little  training  and  almost  all  teachers  can  use  it.  It  does  not require any special tool or equipment. 5. It can be used in every situation.\n3. Non-participant observation is used in the case of abnormal individuals, infants and children. Merits or Director or Non-Participant Observation 1. Being a record of the actual behavior of the child. It is more reliable and objective. 2. It is a study of an individual in a natural situation and is therefore more useful than the restricted study in a test situation.\n6.\nIt is adaptable both to individuals and groups.\n- Limitations and demerits 1. Records may not be written with hundred percent accuracy as the observation is recorded after the actions of the observed. There is some time-lag.\nA  Cumulative  record  is  that  card  or  folder  which  contains  the results  of  different assessments held from time to time during the course of study of a learner.\n2. The observer may get only a small sample of student behavior. It is very difficult to observe  everything  that  a  student  does  or  says.  As  far  as  possible,  observations should be collected from several teachers. 3. It reveals the overt behavior only-behaviour that is expressed and not that is within. 5.4.4.Cumulative Record Card Meaning of a Cumulative Record Card\nNormally a cumulative record card contains information about the growth and development of a learner over a period of 3 to 4 years.  It provides a comprehensive picture of the many-sided development of the learners. On basis of this record, a progress report of the learner may be prepared.

House-based Programme in Child Development. As a part of the effort to evolve an alternative approach to early child hood stimulation, a home-based programme in child development was tried out in 1989 and 1990 in tribal and urban slum areas in Orissa.  The  programme  involved  developing  the  required  confidence  in  the  older family members like the mother, father, grandmother, etc. to take up the role of an educator  to  enhance  the  child's  learning.  The  study  covered  65  homes  of  the Bhagawatipur  tribal  area  and  100  homes  in  the  urban  slums  of  Bhubaneswar  in Orissa.

An ability to interact and communicate meaningfully by being able to\ncome  down  to  the  level  of  children  is  a  necessary  prerequisite.  Skills  in  creative  and performing arts are additional assets which stand the ECE teacher in good stead.\nThe helper should not only be able to help bring children to school and assist the teacher/worker in the day to day implementation of the programme, but also be able to conduct some of the activities with children, as and when the need arises. Particularly in view of this expectation it is necessary that the helper be also adequately trained. These trainings can also be provided on the job itself.\nThese  characteristics and  skills  can  and  should  be  further  reinforced  by  a  well planned and systematic trainings.  This  training  should  be  periodic  in  nature  and  should focus on developing in the teacher/worker an understanding of child development and the skills  to  conduct  activities  to  foster  different  aspects  of  development  in  children.  If  we consider  realities  of  most  ECE  Programmes  in  our  country  we  find  that  an  average  ECE group comprises 30 to 40 children.

About 5600 Balwadis are being run by these organisations. The Children in the age group of three-five years  (about  2.30  lakh)  are  covered  under  the  programme.  Supplementary  nutrition consists of 300 calories and 12-15 grams of proteins per child per day for 270 days in a year.\nWorld Food Programme World  food  programme  (WFP)  extends  food  aid  for  supplementary  nutrition  to  the children below six years, present women and nursing mothers under the 'Project 2206'. A total of 21.20 lakh beneficiaries (19.08 lakh pre-school children and 2.12 lakh mothers) in the states of Assam, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are covered. The plan of operation for WFP Expansion phase V between the Government of India and the World Food Programme was signed on Ninth November, 1989, for two years (for the same number of beneficiaries), beginning from First October, 1990. Special Nutrition Programme (SNP) This programme was launched in 1970-71 to provide supplementary nutrition to children below  six  years  of  age  and  to  expectant  mothers living  in  rural  slums,  tribal  areas  and backward rural areas. Under this programme, supplementary feeding in given for 300 days in a year to provide about 300 calories and 10 grams of protein per child per day and about 500 calories and 20 grams of protein to a mother. Creches and Day-Care Centres Day nurseries were established in Sweden in 1834, in Norway 1837 and; in U.K. in 1866. The first infant crèche for the children of working mothers was opened in Parish in 1844. The first American crèche was established in 1854 in New York.\nThis history of crèches or day-care services in India is about 50 years old. Creches were started by the management of various industries as a welfare measure under the 'Factory Act  of  1948.'  Later  on  subsequent  legislations  made  it  obligatory  for  the  employees  of certain industries employing fifty or more women to provide for crèches. The expenditure on crèche is a charge on the employees.\nDenmark  Czechoslovakia      have  developed  national  system  for  day-care  services.  This system ensures a minimum standard of care for each child in the system.\nBesides industrial establishments, some voluntary organisations and a few departments of Central  Government  and  Local  Bodies  have  also  taken  initiative  in  establishing  day-care centres of crèches in residential colonies. The New Delhi Social Service League aided by the New Delhi Municipal Committee started in 1948 a crèche for the benefit of the sweeper women  working  in  private  houses.  The  experiment  continued  for  two  years.  After  its closure, the NDMC directly organized a crèche for Harijan children at Balmiki Colony.\nThe department of personnel of the Central Government of India, made a beginning in 1968 and within three years 14 crèches were opened."

So is I the case  with  the  teachers.  Hence  their  harmonious  working  together  can  alone  bring  the results we want.\nAdvantages of Parent-Teacher Cooperation Parent-Teacher cooperation is helpful to the teachers in the following ways:\n4.\n1. The teachers acquire maximum understanding about the child by getting relevant information from the parents.\n5. The teachers motivate the parents to donate funds and gifts to the school. 6.

In the field of child education also, voluntary agencies play a significant role after getting government grant from the ministry of women and child development, Government of  India  and  Central  Social  Welfare  Board.  The  Voluntary  agencies  came  forward  to organize child welfare programmes much before the government initiated such programmes through its various Five-Year Plans. Important merits of the programmes of the voluntary agencies are: 1. Supplementary  effort: The  government  has  not  unable  to  fulfill  constitutional provisions regarding free and universal primary education. Primary on account of lack of funds. Voluntary agencies provides funds for pre-school education. 2. Flexibility: The organisation of voluntary agencies is flexible and adaptable. Demerits\n2. Exportation of Staff: The voluntary agencies do not pay adequate remuneration to the staff working in the field.\n3. Fake Organisations: Quite a large number of voluntary agencies in the field of child education and welfare exist on paper only.\n1. Profit Motive: of late if is observed that voluntary agencies tend to undertake child welfare work with profit motive.\n4.

In  1964  SOS.  Children's  village  association  was formed and in 1967, the first village Greenfields was founded near Faridabad, Kalyana, it has registered societies in 13 states. It is concerned with long term care and rehabilitation of orphan and destitute children. It is housed in children's village complexes in family type homes or single unit family homes. SOS has now constructed 21 children's villagers. The pilot  project  at  Greenfields  has  started  a  family  helper  programme  for  disadvantaged children in nearby villages. It has started Balwadis, medical service centre and education for 250 quarry workers children. The SOS also run a foundling home, Udayan, In New Delhi. The construction of the SOS children's village was started in March 1967. Twenty family cottages have been constructed at Greenfields.

GLYPH<UNKNOWN> To enable the students to organize activities for language development. GLYPH<UNKNOWN>\nMeaning of Curriculum In simple words, curriculum includes all the programmes and activities which the school undertakes for the all round development of the learners. As observed by the Secondary Education Commission  (1952-53),  'It  includes  the  totality  of  experience  that  a  pupil receives through the manifold activities that go on in the school-in the classroom, library, laboratory,  workshop,  playground  and  in  the  numerous  informal  contacts  between teachers and pupils. In this case the whole life of the school becomes the curriculum which can  touch  the  life  of  the  students  at  all  points  and  help  in  the  development  of  balanced personality'.\nCurriculum at the pre-Primary Stage: Curriculum in terms of Activities Curriculum  at  the  pre-school  stage  should  be  in  terms  of  activities  related  to  the development of the following basic skills: 1. Physical skills\n6. Moral skills The education commission 1964-66 observed, 'we can hardly talk about a curriculum of activities.  We  agree  with  the  suggestion  of  the  committee  on  Child  Care  (1961-62) appointed by the Central Social Welfare Board that the Programme should consist of the following activities' a. Play Activities:\n2.\nSocial skills\n3.\nSkills to use symbols such as language and numbers\n4.\nConstructive skills\n5.\nPlay skills\n- (i) Free play, including educational and constructional toys, indoor games and outdoor activities in association with children. (ii) Physical activities involving muscular and limb movement.\n- b. Physical training including simple exercises, dance and rhythmic c. Manual activities and play like gardening simple chores and participation in simple community efforts. d. Sensorial education, using natural objects and specially constructed apparatus.\n- (iii) Play involving contact and acquaintance with imitation and experience of physical, family and social environment. (iv) Organized play, group activities and directional play.\n(v)\nPlayground activities using playground apparatus.\n- e. Handwork and artistic activities involving the use of finger skills and tools; and activities like drawing, painting, singing, music and dancing.\n- f. Learning activities, including language; personal hygiene and health rules; elementary nature study involving contact with the physical , plant and animal world; counting etc.\nPlay Activities The impact of recent developments in Child developmental Psychology upon the nature of the  teaching-learning  process  has  been  quite  revolutionary.  In  recent  years,  advances  in information technology have opened several means of teaching-learning through play-way. As  a  matter  of  fact  play  activities  are  as  old  as  the  human  race  itself.  In  the  Harappan civilization, at Harappa and Mahonjodaro, terracotta toys have been unearthed.\n- g. Self -service in school, eliminating as far as possible the use of servants and adult helpers.\nNevertheless the recognition of play-way activities as educational media is one of recent origin. The modern pedagogy envisages a central place for the child.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 th November 1959, Proclaimed the 'Declaration of the  Rights of the  Child' for focusing the attention of the international community  on  happy  childhood.  The  declaration  states:  'The  child  shall  have  full opportunity  for  play  and  recreation  which  should  be  directed  to  the  same  purpose  as education. The society and the public authorities shall endeavor to promote the enjoyment of this right.'"

    "context_enriched_content": "Self Evaluation\nEducators like Froebel, Montessori and Pestalozzi have appreciated the role of play activities  in  the  al-round  growth  and  development  of  the  child  and  promoted  the  same through their  publications  and  teaching -learning  practices.    Other  psychologists  and thinkers  like  Gesell  and  Piaget  have  also  stresses  the  role  of  play  in  the  growth  and development  of  the  child.  In  India,  Giju  Bhai  has  played  a  significant  role  in  play-way movement.\nPlay is of great importance in the life of every child. It is the most effective learning situation for him. It is an intensely absorbing experience and even more important to the child than work to the adult. It has been observed that 'A child uses play also to make up for defeats, sufferings and frustrations'. Play is important as a means of contributing to a happy and creative childhood. The insatiable urge for play among children is an expression of the energy and vitality and muscular action. A child who plays is a very happy child. Play, along  with  the  basic  needs  of  nutrition,  health,  shelter  and  education  is  vital  to  the  full development of the child.\n1. There should be a variety of activities for the children in the age-group 3,4 and 5 even through the objectives and behavioural outcomes may be  the same. Repetition of  the  same  activity  or  imitation  of the  same  model,  time  and  again  should  be discouraged.\nPrinciples of Selecting and Guiding Play-way Activities The NCERT in its publication Pre-primary Institutions- Their Supervision has suggested the following board principles for selecting and organizing activities:\n2. The  requirements  of  the  children  even  of  the  same  age-group  should  also  be considered in relation to their physical development and social environment.\n3. The  play-way  activities  should  have  the  potentialities  to  provide  for  free  and intelligent expression.\n4. The experience of play  should  result  in  happiness  for  the  children  and  should  be satisfying to them. 5. There should be a free atmosphere for the children to move about.\n6. There should be a good number of group activities. The children should be allowed to  come  in  contact  with  a  number  of  companions  through  various  activities  and programmes.\n9. The  individually  of each  child  should  be  respected  to  the  utmost.  Any  difficulty encountered  on  account  of  child's  temperament  should  not  be  harshly  deal  with. The  pre-school  teacher  or  the  Balsevika  should  act  more  as  'a  nursing  mother,  a friend and a guide than as a preceptor'.\n7. The equipment which the children handle and play with, should as far as possible be drawn  from  the  local  environment.  This  will  help  the  children  to  have  a  better understanding, and make better utilization, of the environment around them.\n8. Some  of  the  equipment  and  activities  should  be  related  to  progressive  changes happening in the society around them.\n10. For the age group 4½ to 6 years, some of the activities should be directed to result in  learning  experiences  conductive  to  school  readiness  in  the  children.  Therefore, such activities should have relationship with the activities to be purchased by the children later on in Grades I and II. This is necessary so that the children from the pre-school  institutions  are  able  to  adjust  with  the  atmosphere  of  the  primary schools when they join them at the age of 6. Activity Based Approach: Child-Centred Education All educators and psychologists consider the child as the 'hero' in the drama of education and as such he should dominate it. He should receive the utmost attention. The call of the National Policy on Education, 1986, and the modified policy of 1992 is to develop a 'childcentred and activity based process of learning'.\n1. Child is the agent of his own learning. Out of the three components of a teachinglearning situation- the child, the teacher and the environment, prominent place of pride should be given to him. He must become the most important agent of learning. 2. Children learn best when they are active.\nFollowing  are  the  important  considerations  in  making  education  child-centered  and activity centred and not subject centred:"

Activity-centred approach is more psychological than logical at the pre-school stage. 5. Sri Aurobindo has observed, 'The first principle of true teaching is that nothing can be taught. The teacher is a helper and guide'. 6. Dewey has said, 'Where there is experience, there is living being'.\n7.\nDewey has also emphasized 'Action must proceed knowledge'.\n8. Rousseau has observed, 'The child is restless and then curious. Instead of making the child to stick to his books. I keep him busy in workshop, his hands will work to the profit of his mind.' 9. Each child is unique. He learns through activity and play.\n14. Activities are needed for promoting various types of practical skills of daily life. 5.7.1 Activities at the Pre School Stage: Art, Music and Clay Work\n12. A  stimulating  environment  is  needed  at  the  pre-school  stage  for  stimulating cognitive growth. 13. A climate for healthy emotional development is needed for creating self-confidence.\n10. Children are very creative. They need guidance to develop their creativity. 11. The early years need adequate nutrition and health care and this should be attended to carefully.\nFree play Activities\n2.\nIn  free  play  the  child  is  free  to  undertake  an  activity  without  any  external  restraint. He engages  himself  spontaneously.  It  provides  opportunities  to  the  child  to  explore  and express himself. It can take the form of active and passive activities and indoor and outdoor activities. Following are examples of free play activities: 1. Card-board games, etc\n6.\nCut-outs\n7.\n3.\nDancing\n8.\n4.\nDoll and doll house\n9.\n5.\nDramatics\n10. Painting\nDrawing\n11. Pictures and animals birds, etc.\nExcursions\n12.

Water-play\nGuided or Structured Activities Activities  which  are  undertaken  usually  under  the  guidance  of  teachers  and  parents  are known  as  guided  activities.  These  are  planned  activities.  Structured  activities  may  be undertaken  by  an  individual  child  or  in    groups.  The  'Gifts  of  Frobel'  and  'Montessori apparatus',  etc.  fall  under  this  category.  Free  activities  which  are  undertaken  under  the supervision    of  teacher  may  also  be  placed  in  this  category.  There  is  no  water  light compartment. However, balance may be struck in free activities and guided activities. Outdoor and Indoor Activities 1. Outdoor  activities  are  those  activities  which  are  undertaken  outside  the  home  or classroom.  These  include  running,  jumping,  galloping,  climbing,  hopping or  even rolling on the grass. They also include outdoor games. In fact outdoor play includes all types of play outside the home and the classroom.\n3. Indoor activities include all the activities which are done in the home itself. In fact  all  the  activities  mentioned  under  free-play  are  covered  in  the  category  of indoor activities. 5.7.1. Language Development Activities\n2. Through  outdoor  play,  the  child  learns  to  observe  and  experience  with  a variety  of  materials  such  as  leaves, flowers,  twigs,  seeds,  pebbles,  trees,  wooden boxes, etc. He also learns to cooperate with his peers. He learns the social value of organizing a group.\nSee in previous Chapters"

    "context_enriched_content": "Nature study and Science Experience through Environmental Activities\nImportance of Nature study and science Experience The importance of nature study and science experience through environment during the pre-primary stage is well recognized as a part of the pre-primary school programme. This leads to the development of structures, practices and ideas suitable for these children. It is observed that a child from infancy begins to discriminate and generalize about environmental  data.  If the children are provided  with  suitable  stimulating  science experiences, abstractions are likely to proceed more readily. Concepts seem to arise out of actual  experiences  with  the  objects  and  situations.  Most  children  attending  pre-schools recognize  the  various  sensations  received  by  sense  organs  and  organize  them  into  a framework. They think intuitively and focus their attention on specific objects within their environments.\nCharacteristics of the Child An understanding of the characteristics of the child enables us to develop programme of nature  study  and  science  suitable  to  the  children  at  the  pre-primary  level.  Some  of  the important research findings are:\n2. Children  love  to  explore.  The  words  'what',  'why'  and  'how'  are  common  in  their vocabulary.\n1. Children affected by all  kinds  of  environmental  phenomena.  They  try  to  interpret these phenomena with different stages of maturity. A good programme should take advantage of children's curiosity to initiate effective learning in the class-room.\n3. Children  are  very  energetic.  They  will  often  spend  lot  of  time  and  effort  to  solve problems that are important to them. Hence, programmes should be developed in the form of problems.\n4. A good environment programme should provide a wide variety of nature study and science experiences that involve doing learning activities.\n1. Building the child's knowledge about the properties of all objects In his environment.\n4. Children  like  to  work  together in  planning  and  carrying  out  their  activities. Therefore, a  good  environmental  programme  should  provide  suitable  group activities. Promoting Environmental Education The objectives of environmental education may be formulated as follows:\n5.\n2. Providing opportunities to explore the properties of unfamiliar things. 3. Developing the ability to group objects according to their qualitative  and quantitative aspects. 4. Comparing and arranging things according to a given dimension,\nFostering curiosity\n6.\nDeveloping in children creative abilities.\n7.\nDeveloping in children interactions with other children.\nActivities Related to Environment Education Following  types  of  activities  are  very  useful  In  providing  environmental  experience  to children. All these activities are related to daily life of the children:\n- i. Field  trips  for  observation  of  the  natural  phenomenon  such  as  the  sunset,  clouds, rainbow, bird nests, bird watching , etc.\n- ii. Observation and  participation  in  the  local  village  festivals,  folk  songs,  fold  dance, folk dress, etc. iii. Room decorations and arrangement of Balwadi equipment.\nviii.\niv.\nCreative activities like drawing, painting, music, dramatization, puppetry and crafts.\nv.\nVisits to fairs, markets, historical buildings in the neighbourhood.\nvi.\nAttending public functions and festivals, vii.\nListening to musical programmes\nDeveloping Scientific Concepts Scientific concepts include the following:\nVisiting art galleries etc.\n1.\nDevelopment of concept of time.\n2.\nDevelopment of concept of season.\n3.\nDevelopment of the concept of the human body.\n- Organising Activities for the Development of Concept of Time and Season. 1. Various  activities  should  be  organized  in  such  a  way  that the  child  is  able  to distinguish between play time, work time, snack time and rest time, stories time and song time etc. 2. A child should be made aware of maintaining a balance between the various things.\n4.\nDevelopment of living and non-living things.\n3. Older  children  say  about  4  or  more  may  be  encouraged to  arrange  their  daily programme by rising early, brushing their teeth before morning breakfast etc. 4. Similarly a child can be given the concept of time by cutting nails periodically.\n5. The  concept  of  seasons  can  be  given  to  children  by  associating  their  actual experiences of feeling warm or cold or wet."

It helps children create and express themselves. Children have a natural tendency to be creative and if they are not given any opportunity to create  anything  they  become  dull.  Therefore,  they  should  be  encourages  to  realize  their potential.\nChildren should be asked to prepare different designs both by hand and in moulds. These moulds can be prepared in the classes according to the designs children themselves have made. They can prepare designs of animals, birds, flowers, vegetables, etc. The following steps may be followed in this connection.\n4. Positive suggestions should be given to children. 5.
