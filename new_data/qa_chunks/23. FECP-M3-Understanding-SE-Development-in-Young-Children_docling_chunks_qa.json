    "context_enriched_content": "SOCIAL -EMOTIONAL WELLNESS\nDeveloping the ability to experience and control emotions, form secure positive relationships, and explore and learn in all areas of the child's environment (family, community and cultural background).\nRelationships are key in developing trust, empathy, compassion, generosity and conscience.\nSocial-emotional development is a child's ability to understand the feelings of others, control their own feelings and behaviors, and get along with peers.  In order for children to attain the basic skills that they need such as cooperation, following directions, demonstrating self-control and paying attention, they must have social-emotional skills.  Feelings of trust, confidence, pride, friendship, affection and humor are all a part of a child's social-emotional development. A child's positive relationship with trusting and caring adults is the key to successful emotional and social development.\nSocial and emotional development involves the acquisition of a set of skills.  Key among them are the ability to:\n- Identify and understand one's own feelings\n- Accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others\n- Manage strong emotions and their expression in a constructive manner\n- Regulate one's own behavior\n- Develop empathy for others\n- Establish and sustain relationships\nEach of these skills develop on their own timetable and build upon one another.  The foundation of social emotional development begins in infancy.  A two-month-old infant is soothed and smiles at the voice of a parent.  When the caregiver talks to the child, he/she will fixate on the face of the loved one.  Being able to read your child's cues and attending to them from the day they are born starts the creation of social-emotional development in your child. You are creating a secure trusting and loving relationship with your child.\nIn this ECDC Bulletin we will explain the importance of social-emotional development, and we will also talk about social-emotional development by a child's age range, as well as give activities that will help your child's development."

    "context_enriched_content": "Why is Social -Emotional Development Important?\nA child's social-emotional development is as important as their cognitive and physical development.  It is important to know that children are not born with social-emotional skills.  It is the role of the parents, caregivers, and teachers of children to teach and foster these abilities.\nA child's social-emotional development provides them with a sense of who they are in the world, how they learn, and helps them establish quality relationships with others.  It is what drives an individual to communicate, connect with others and more importantly helps resolve conflicts, gain confidence and reach goals.  Building a strong socialemotional foundation as a child will help the child thrive and obtain happiness in life. They will be better equipped to handle stress and persevere through difficult times in their lives as an adult.\nHow do we, as parents, support the socialemotional development in our child?  In the past educators have stressed academic skills to determine success in a child. Those archaic days are long gone and now we know the importance of social-emotional development. The approach to teaching social-emotional development is more vague than physical or cognitive development, but there is an increasing amount of research available to support it.  This being said, we as parents and educators must learn to read our child's emotional cues so that we can help them identify their emotions; model the behavior for our children; interact with our child affectionately; show consideration for their feelings, desires and needs; express interest in their daily activities; respect their viewpoints; express pride in their accomplishments; and provide encouragement and support during times of stress.\nSOURCE : Moore, 1992"

From the moment that a baby is born, parents create a bond with their child. The way that a parent reacts to their child's needs and cues help build social connections. Before their child is four months old parents must build trust and security for their newborn by attending to their basic needs (feeding, comforting, and changing diapers).\nIt is important for a parent to know the different types of cries of their child. Although a child is figuring out how to self-soothe through sucking their fist, they still need a parent to help calm them.  Babies are born with little self-control. They act and react naturally without the ability to stop themselves. Guidance from caregivers help them begin to manage their feelings and reactions. This can be done by talking to the baby in a soft voice, rocking the child, or swaddling the child when they are upset.  Attending to your baby's needs and helping to soothe them are creating a positive social-emotional bond with your child.\nStarting at four months your baby will be able to do more things.  They will start picking up their heads, holding objects, rolling over and learning to crawl. This is also about the time that your child will be forming their attachment. Attachment is the strong emotional tie felt between and infant and their primary caregiver-the child will form an attachment to people who take of them most often. When attachments are formed, young infants learn that they can depend on mothers, fathers, caregivers, or older siblings to make them feel better. The quality of attachment depends upon the caregivers.\nStarting about seven months, children at this age tend to have separation anxiety when their parent leaves. It is important that you prepare your child before leaving them. Talk to them and tell them you will be back soon. In the beginning, leave the child with someone they know and for just a short time. Greet the child when you return. You can continue to increase the time that you will be gone. This will ease your child into this transition.\nSOURCE:  Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006"

    "context_enriched_content": "Toddlers (12 to 36 Months)\nToddlers view themselves as the 'center of the world' and can be very possessive.  'No' becomes a favorite word and a way to assert their independence.  Your child is on the move at this age.  With this new found mobility they have gained more independence. They may become easily frustrated when they cannot do the things they want which can result in temper and emotions can be very intense but short lived.  This increased awareness of self and ownership (sharing and not sharing) is normal development.  It expresses a toddler's growing independence and self-sufficiency (self-control is just beginning at this age and really begins to develop in the second year.)  Toddlers enjoy playing by themselves or next to (not necessarily with) other children.  Although it is good to talk about sharing and other people's feelings, it is too early to expect your child to share or understand another person's feelings.  These are skills they will develop in the coming years.\nIt is important to help foster your child's independence, but you must also guide your child with set limits and discipline.  It will be natural for the child to test his/her limits. Many parents worry about spoiling the child because he/she has more independence.  'An independent one-year old is not a spoiled child. [A] spoiled child is one who doesn't know when to expect limits.'  Building a foundation where the child knows what to expect and their limits will make it possible for the child to learn social cues and build better relationships.\nRoutines are very important at this age because they make a child feel secure.  One of the greatest gift we can give our children/toddlers is consistency and structure.  Once toddlers become more secure in knowing what is and what is not expected, they can begin to learn how to resolve conflict, problem solve and communicate effectively with others as they move towards their preschool years.\nIn these first years of the child's life, parents should help the child build confidence in their independence by creating a safe environment for them to explore, be supportive of their independence by giving praise and explaining things that the child is exploring, and develop a constant routine.\nSOURCE:  Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006"

During early preschool years, children want to please others.  Preschoolers need frequent approval, reassurance, and attention.  They may become fearful when separated from parents or caregivers but are generally easily consoled and adjust to new environments within a few minutes.  Preschool age children are beginning to learn how to interact with their peers.  Children this age are more able to acquire socialemotional skills because of they have grown more mentally and physically.  They are more able to self-regulate and have been learning how to read other people's emotions.\nAt three years of age a child takes a huge leap into the world of socialization.  When children of this age are exposed to social opportunities, they will most naturally gravitate towards social play.  It is the role of the parent and caregivers to help 'coach' a child through social interactions when they need it.  Parents and adults need to give the child words to join into play and give them options on how to resolve conflicts.  Starting to learn these skills now will help foster self-confidence in your child and make them feel positive about playing with other children.\nAt this age the child's imagination is growing.  It is important to let the child be creative and encourage their imagination.  'With all this bubbling imagination, two new attributes appear. A sense of humor is likely to surface, and a child's ability to show empathy for others will become apparent.'\nBy four years of age preschoolers spend a lot of time playing fantasy games.  They will try to be 'like' all kinds of people from mom and dad, to the garbage man, to a policeman.  The purpose behind this type of play is to understand the role of adults in their life.  A child's personality and emotional control develops a lot during the preschool years.  Teaching and helping a child understand and recognize their feelings will help them as they get older.  The foundation for their life long social interactions is being created.  As preschoolers get older they become less dependent on others.  They are more confident and independent.  Children start to understand how to behave in social situations  by cooperating, sharing, and following rules. You will notice that your child will increasingly argue with you to justify their wants and ideas.  You will find that they can use your logic to justify why they should be able to do something that you previous did not agree to do.  It is our job to model the behavior we want in our children, help them identify and validate their feelings, and give them skills to interact with peers.\nRemember that children are different.  A child may be out-going, loving, and react to new situations with curiosity.  Some children may be shy, have trouble warming up to people, and cautious of new situations or they may be demanding or un-cooperative.  No single personality is 'better' or 'worse' than any other.  It may be more difficult for some children to join into play with their peers than other child and this is fine.  As parents and caregivers we can help our children with their emotions by providing them with structure, consistency and realistic expectations for their behavior.  This will help the child gain more confidence in building friendships and help them join into play with their peers.  Social-emotional skills will stay with the child for the span of their life.\nSOURCE:  Brazelton & Sparrow, 2006"

Places such as the park, birthday parties, amusement parks, museums, and school will prove to be much more stressful for some children.  The child may be calm and play well at home but become anxious when they are in public places with other children around.  This is natural.  It is good for children to be exposed to these places so that they will learn how to deal with an environment different from home.  Children are much more excited and it is sometimes hard for them to control their emotions.  As parents and caregivers we must be there to help support our children.  We are not born with social skills.  We learn them by watching people and by how we are taught.
