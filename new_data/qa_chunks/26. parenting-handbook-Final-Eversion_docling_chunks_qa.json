    "context_enriched_content": "FOREWORD\nThe history of the world would have been very different if people had a higher capacity to remain calm under stress.  How many wars would have been averted if leaders had not 'flown off the handle' and allowed their run-away emotions and reactions to drive their decisions! While we cannot change the pages of history we have already written, ahead of us are blank sheets of paper on which humanity can write a new story of joy, peace and abundance for all.\nWriting this new narrative will need major changes in the way we educate our children at school and at home. It is today's children who will be the leaders shaping the future we will all grow into. Education today lays the foundation for the kind of world we will live in tomorrow. At a time when the world is going through major changes, including the rapid emergence of new technologies, we see huge challenges and opportunities before educators and parents. Our children need to be groomed with wisdom and grace and our education too needs to be deeply anchored in a space of joy, peace and ease.\nThis Handbook is an important step in this direction, taken by parents and educators of the Kaveri Group of Schools. I express my deepest appreciation to Malati Kalmadi and her team for taking this initiative.  Having known and worked with the core team associated with this book  (Malati Kalmadi, Vijayam Kartha, Zarin Virji, Jyoti Kumta,  Sunder Iyer, and Arundhati Hattangadi)  for almost 25 years as part of the process of Education Today, Society Tomorrow (ETST), I can say that  deep compassion, practical care and  love for children are the driving forces behind this noble project. We have all shared many moments of joy and serendipity at the ETST Workshops at Asia Plateau, Panchgani. One of the key tenets we all share is the practice of being silent and listening to inner guidance.\nThis project, backed by the Greater Good Science Centre, University of California, Berkeley, is well grounded in research. The format of the book is simple, straightforward, and extremely well structured. For parents who are looking for a handy reference manual for parenting with mindfulness and compassion, this book is an excellent source of valuable information and tips. After nearly 35 years in the field of developing Leaders and Educators in Corporations, NGOs, Government and also in Educational Institutions, I have come to the conclusion that most problems arise from one fundamental root: we have forgotten the vast resources of Peace, Purity and Possibility  that lie latent within each of us in each moment. We let our minds hijack us away from the creative intelligence and grace which abounds in the Now. The antidote is to cultivate presence and mindfulness. ' A Guide to Mindfulness', Chapter 1 of this Handbook, tells you precisely how to do this. Several tested meditation techniques have been shared.\nI remember buying the book What do you really want for your children? by Dr Wayne W Dyer, when my two daughters Nitya and Pragnya were little. The first chapter of the book was about me; and so was the next … and the next… till the very end of the book! At first, I felt cheated. On hindsight, parenting is more about us as adults rather than it is about our children. What behaviours are we modelling?  What is the example we are setting? Values and character are caught, not taught. The Mindful Parenting Program (MPP) Handbook illustrates this beautifully in the section 'Ancient Wisdom for Today's Parents'.\nWhat makes this Handbook unique is that the practical wisdom shared in it comes from the tested experiences of parents and dedicated teachers who are also parents.  The contents therefore are not only practical, but also presented in an inspiring and simple format, with the added value of practices that can be readily applied.\nThis Handbook is a timely boon for parents and teachers. It will open up clear pathways and methods to be not only more peaceful themselves, but also to radiate more consciousness and compassion in their parenting and nurturing. Let us join hands with the growing community of mindful parents so that we can create a world which serves our children by enabling and empowering them to co-create a world of joy, peace and abundance.\nMay this Handbook be the harbinger of compassion for yourself, dear reader, and through your mindfulness and presence, for the children whom you will inspire and influence."

    "context_enriched_content": "INTRODUCTION\nMatthieu Ricard, also known as 'the world's happiest man', in his book, Altruism , provides an impressive 1,600 scientific references, to prove that genuine concern for the well-being of others can transform the world. Imagine a world where a majority of people are loving, compassionate, grateful and generous!\nAnd what can be a better place to kindle and nurture these qualities than school, where children spend their most impressionable age? Moreover, it is the only place where a cross section of society - right from the lowest strata to the elite converge with a common purpose:  educating their children.\nThe Mindful Parenting Program (MPP) is an initiative with this Vision: 'to help parents nurture mindfulness, generosity, gratitude, forgiveness, and related character strengths in themselves and their children and thereby foster a compassionate society.' The Handbook is an effort to fulfil this vision, by providing the modern-day parent, who is willing to go that extra mile, with time-tested tips and techniques to raise happy, caring and responsible children. https://mindfulparentingindia.com/\nMPP is an initiative of Kaveri Group of Institutions(KGI) https://kaveri.edu.in/ for its community of  parents, in collaboration with the Greater Good Science Centre, University of California , Berkeley https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/\nIt is a two-year project for the period from April 2018 to March 2020 , funded by the John Templeton Foundation . KGI has the proud privilege to be ONE of the only two international grantees (and the only one from India), out of over 200 applications received by GGSC.\nBeing a parent is a natural process and we often expect it to be stress-free and straight-forward. Perhaps it was, at one time, when a parent just had to follow prevalent and traditional child-rearing norms. The average parent had hardly any\naccess to the path-breaking ideas of early educationists and psychologists like Piaget, Bandura, Maria Montessori, Freud, Jung, and others.\nFast forward to the present, and today's parent is faced with a plethora of choices to tackle the innumerable challenges of parenting in a fast-changing world. Life is no longer as simple as it was in the past and it is a huge task to pick and choose from the limitless sources of parenting information! This Handbook, by the MPP group, provides a ready reckoner that parents can follow easily and use effectively, on a daily basis, more in the mode of preventive maintenance of the family fabric, rather than as a disaster management manual!\nWhat makes this handbook unique is the fact that it has been carefully curated BY Parents FOR Parents. So you can be rest assured that a sincere attempt has been made to make it as simple and as practical as possible.\nAll the tips and activities mentioned in this handbook have been curated from authentic and reputed web resources, collated from the pearls of wisdom shared by experts during workshops, and are based on the challenges and solutions shared by parents themselves.\nMay this handbook add to your unique experiences and experiments with the joy and responsibility of being a parent."

    "context_enriched_content": "HOW TO USE THIS HANDBOOK\nThe contents page will give you an overview of this Handbook. The chapters have been arranged in a manner that takes you step by step: from Self -awareness through meditation and other techniques, to Assimilation through understanding character strengths and problem areas, and on to Action through practical solutions and activities.\nIn this Handbook, we have provided Mindfulness and Meditation practices. Mindfulness and meditation go hand-in-hand: mindfulness supports and enriches meditation, while meditation nurtures and expands mindfulness. Where mindfulness can be applied to any situation throughout the day, meditation is usually practiced for a specific amount of time. (For more information, click here )\nWe have used the words 'character strengths' to denote pro-social skills like Gratitude, Generosity, Compassion, Forgiveness and others in sync with the terminology used by the Greater Good Science Centre.\nThroughout the Handbook, we encourage parents to lead by example. Once they themselves develop these strengths, skills, as well as the practices, their children can imbibe them better.\nPlease don't feel overwhelmed by the number of practices and parenting tips given in this Handbook. You may pick and choose the ones which you find appealing, easy and practical. The same practice or strategy may not suit every parent or every child.  Observe your child's temperament and pick what is best suited to him or her.\nAs you go through this Handbook, you will see that certain points/ideas/tips are repeated, like the following:\n- Be a role model. Set an example.\n- Meditate daily.\n- Practice gratitude intentionally. Have an attitude of gratitude always.\n- Love your child unconditionally.\n- Listen to your child with full attention.\n- Spend quality time with your child.\n- Have regular family time.\n- Limit gadget time/screen time for yourself and your family.\nThe Handbook keeps returning to and emphasizing these concepts and practices because they are the building blocks or cornerstones. Research points out that a happy and secure childhood with warm and supporting relationships helps the child to cope with life's challenges successfully.\n******"

    "context_enriched_content": "What is Mindfulness?\nThe earliest records of meditation can be found in the Vedas, the oldest texts of Hinduism, dating from 1700-1100 BCE. Later, different forms of meditation began developing in Buddhism and Taoism, mainly in India and China.\nIn 1979, Professor Emeritus Jon Kabat Zinn, Founder and former Director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, introduced Meditation as a secular practice, in his Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme. He helped to bring the practice of Mindfulness meditation into mainstream medicine and demonstrated that it can bring improvements in both physical and psychological symptoms as well as positive changes in attitudes and behaviour.\nAccording to him, Mindfulness is 'paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally and it does not matter what we are paying attention to, as it is the attending that is of importance.' Since then, numerous studies have reported and proven the health benefits, both physical and mental, of practicing Mindfulness, and the practice has gained popularity, the world over.\nParents can begin with doing these Mindfulness exercises provided here themselves, and feel the benefits. Later, they can draw their children to do them too."

    "context_enriched_content": "1.1 Anapana Meditation\nAnapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation. Anapana means observation of our natural, normal respiration, as it comes in and as it goes out. This form of meditation is an easy to learn, objective and scientific technique that helps develop concentration.\nObservation of our own breath is the ideal focus for meditation. Our own breath is everpresent and always available to us. Moreover,\n'This mind that wanders wherever it wishes, wherever it desires, wherever it sees pleasure, I will first make it steadfast. I will train it thoroughly like a mahout with a goad, trains a wild elephant.' Dhammapada 326\npracticing Anapana does not need any kind of special tools, and it is completely secular or non-sectarian, meaning it does not have anything to do with any religion. Because of its simplicity, the technique is easy to understand and practice on a daily basis, however busy our lives are."

Relax.\n•\nFocus attention at the entrance of your nostrils. Be aware of every breath coming\nin and going out; natural and normal\nbreath as it is. Just remain alert and\n- attentive, constantly aware of your incoming and outgoing breath. Like a gatekeeper, pay attention to  every breath entering and exiting your nostrils.\n- Practice this meditation for a minimum of 10 minutes daily; increase it steadily to half an hour if you can."

The aim is to use the raisin to bring all your attention to the present and focus it in the moment. It is a way to gently stop your senses from being distracted by all the inputs from the world around you, and focus inwards. Raisin meditation is a good next step after you have learnt to practice Anapana.\n'The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive,  you'll  see  it.' - Thich Nhat Hanh"

Notice its shape, size, color, texture.\n- Then pick it up between two fingers and notice the feeling. Bring it to your nose and smell it closely. How does it feel, smell?\n- Place the raisin on your tongue and roll it around without biting it. Be aware of the sensations.\n- Bite into it lightly and slowly chew it without swallowing it. Notice the sensations, flavours and textures and how these change from moment to moment.\n- Now swallow it and sense what's left of the raisin moving down through your gullet, and into the stomach.\nAn eight-week training programme that includes raisin meditation, developed by Jon Kabat Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School has concluded that the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Programme effectively reduces stress, anxiety and chronic illness in daily life."

    "context_enriched_content": "1.3 Loving Kindness Meditation\nLoving kindness, or ' metta' , as it is called in the Pali language, is unconditional love for everyone in the universe . This form of meditation is one of the most popular techniques and research suggests that practicing loving kindness meditation regularly increases one's capacity for forgiveness, connection to others, selfacceptance, and reduces stress. It focuses on sending loving energy to ourselves and others, even those we do not agree or vibe with, and results in better social interactions and closer relationships.\n'The most precious gift we can offer anyone is our attention. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.' -Thich Nhat Hanh"

    "context_enriched_content": "The Practice\n- Sit comfortably on a chair with your back straight and feet on the ground. Close your eyes, take a deep breath and relax.\n- Receiving loving kindness: Keep your eyes closed and think of a person\n- who loves you very much. Imagine him/her sending you love and warm wishes for good health and happiness. Bask in that person's warmth and love.\n- Sending loving kindness to loved ones: Now send your loving wishes to someone close to you and repeat the phrase silently : 'May you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain.'\n- Sending loving kindness to neutral people: Now think of someone towards whom you have no feelings and similarly send loving wishes for their health and welfare. Repeat the phrase silently: 'May you live with ease, happiness and good health'.\n- Sending loving kindness to all living beings: Now expand your awareness to the whole world and send loving wishes to all beings in the world. Repeat the phrase silently: 'May you all live with ease, happiness and good health.'\nStart with a 5-10 minute practice, which can be steadily increased to half an hour to an hour.\nResearch suggests that when people practice loving kindness meditation regularly, they automatically start reacting more positively to others. One particular study has shown that 'people who practiced loving-kindness meditation daily for seven weeks reported a steady increase in their daily experience of positive emotions, such as joy, gratitude, contentment, hope, and love. They also reported greater life satisfaction and lower depressive symptoms following the intervention, compared to when they started. People who were on a waitlist to learn the practice didn't report these benefits.'"

Tell him to feel his hands or the stuffed toy rise as his belly fills with air.\n- Ask him to exhale to a slow count to four. Tell him he might see his toy fall as he feels his belly shrinking slowly through the count to four. He can place it back on his belly for the next round.\n- Encourage him to do five to ten rounds of belly-breathing.\nOnce parents and children develop the habit of practicing these Mindfulness and Meditation techniques regularly or as often as they can, surprising and positive changes will be seen in your daily interactions within and outside the family.\n******"

    "context_enriched_content": "What are Character Strengths?\nPsychologists have identified two broad categories of strengths: talents and character. Talents are performance-based and observable, including abilities in sports, music, art, computers, problem solving, and other such areas. They are externally manifested or presented.\nCharacter strengths are personality-based and internal, and include traits like gratitude, compassion, courage, love, and kindness. In 2004, Martin Seligman and Chris Peterson proposed a new model for the study of character as a 'constellation of character strengths'.\nStudies show that actively helping children imbibe character strengths will help them to grow up as happy, caring, courageous, responsible and successful adults. Among all character strengths, the practice of Gratitude and Mindfulness is a remedy to many physical, mental and emotional problems, research across the world tells us. Mindfulness and Gratitude are also excellent practices to move on the spiritual path."

It is that much more natural for a child to absorb them, once he or she sees these practices becoming part of the parents' way of life."

Small gestures of appreciation, such as thank you notes, or a detailed gratitude letter is a great way to increase your own feelings of gratitude and happiness while also making the other person feel\n- appreciated and valued; it may also deepen your relationship with them.\n- Learn Prayers of Gratitude. In many spiritual traditions, prayers of gratitude are the most powerful form of prayer, because through them\npeople recognize the ultimate source of all they are and all they will ever be.

For instance, volunteering even a little time at an NGO with the old, or the underprivileged, or even spending quality time with an ageing or ill neighbour or relative, putting aside some of their many toys or books that they can spare, to give to an orphanage or to your domestic help's child… there are many avenues that you can lead them to, even in small ways.\n- Teach your kids to genuinely appreciate and acknowledge people whom we generally take for granted, like the driver, the maid, the security guard and others. This practice will also help them to develop gratitude,\n- generosity and humility, and to understand the pressures on people around them.\n- Give of yourself, your time. Your presence can be more powerful than you know. The action of physically being with someone when they are hurting can make all the difference in the world. Encourage children to spend even a little time with anyone who is ill, or incapacitated in some way, or to make them something, read to them - there are many ways of being present."

It is important to acknowledge mistakes, feel appropriate remorse, and learn from them so they don't happen again. But most people tend to be either overly self-critical or the opposite, which is being defensive and too afraid to accept that they made a mistake. Forgiving yourself serves to put your weaknesses and misdeeds in perspective, to highlight your many good qualities surrounding your lapses, to encourage you to keep getting back on the high road even if you've gone down the low one. Start by picking something relatively small that you're still being hard on yourself about and then go on to bigger issues, and visualize or hear yourself saying 'It is ok - now that you know better, you will do better'.\n- Forgiving others: Almost everyone has experienced being wronged by someone. It could be a former co-worker, friend, or family member. But hanging on to those negative feelings can do great harm to your health.\n- Forgiving a person who has wronged you is never easy but dwelling on those events and re-living them over and over can fill your mind with negative thoughts and suppressed anger. When you learn to forgive, you are no longer trapped by the past actions of others and can finally feel free. The relationship can then move forward - either becoming richer, or it can be ended but with no residual rancor that returns like acid reflux. You can either express your forgiveness in writing or\n- speaking to the person, or it can be an internal decision to let it go.\n- Asking for forgiveness : To build relationships and create communities (work, family, politics, neighbours), we need to acknowledge personal mistakes and genuinely apologize in writing or by saying it out loud when needed, so that we can let go and move forward."

Instead, spend quality time with your child and engage the child in other activities.\n- Fun time/diversions: Children resort to gadgets mostly because they are bored. Plan fun activities; engage your children in games; take them outdoors; exercise with them; provide them with books, board games, art supplies,\n- sporting equipment etc. Enroll them in hobbies of their choice like music, dance or art; arrange play dates for them. Carry scribbling/drawing materials, books, puzzles etc when you know that your child needs to be occupied.\n- Moderation: Allocate an appropriate amount of screen time for your child. Let her choose what time of the day she wants to use the gadgets and agree on a start by and end by time. This gives her a sense of freedom and responsibility.\n- Gadget Free Zone: Keep certain areas gadget-free such as the dining area, the prayer room and the child's bedroom.\n- Clear Rules: Make clear and strict rules with no re-negotiations or compromises allowed. Make tough decisions and put your foot down on limiting unhealthy habits. For example, make it a rule that children will be allowed to watch TV or play with gadgets, only after they complete their schoolwork. Don't give in to their tears and tantrums for a few days and children will learn to obey you.\n- Praise your child's efforts when he makes the effort to prioritize other activities over screen time, on his own accord.\n- Monitor the Content: Make sure the apps, videos and content are ageappropriate. Have conversations regarding the risks and dangers of the Web with them and how to be safe online. Children should be told equally about the boon and bane of screen time. Conversations such as these will help them to make wiser choices.\n- Online Protection Tools: Online tools let you control your kids' access to adult material and help protect them from Internet predators. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) provide parent-control options. You can also get software that helps block access to sites and restricts personal information from being sent online.\n- Pet Love: There is nothing like having a pet in the house. It keeps the whole family away from gadgets! If this is not possible, cultivate a small garden or a few pots or a dish garden, together as a family."

Audacity, insecurity, loneliness, psychological vulnerability, enormous mood swings and strong peer group need are some of the characteristics of this stage. Attraction to the opposite sex begins during this time. The transitional period can raise questions of independence and identity.

Spend quality time with your child, talking to him and playing with him. Hug him often, talk to him lovingly and reinforce his good behaviour by praising him.\n- Mind the basics: Is your child thirsty, hungry, overtired, or over-stimulated? These are common preconditions for tantrums. Carry snacks and water on outings, and avoid potential tantrum triggers - a shopping trip, for example - when you know your child is tired.\n•\nRoutines rule:\nDevelop family routines - for example, regular meal and bedtimes - and\nstick to it. Young children's lives are full of\n- change and constant stimulation. Plus, they're growing fast. Therefore, anything you can do to add stability will help them feel more secure.\n- Use feeling words: Encourage your child to label and describe his feelings. You can help your child develop vocabulary to express himself by saying things like, 'I can see that you are feeling upset because you really wanted a treat,' or 'Did it make you angry when Som yelled at you?'\n- Give (limited) choices: Don't give your child free rein to state any whim. Instead, offer two or three viable options - whether it's a snack, an activity, or what to wear. For example, you can say, 'You need to wear shoes to school because that is the rule. Would you rather wear your tennis shoes or your boots?'\n- Pediatrician Laurel Schultz emphasizes that matters of safety should never be negotiated: a child must always use a seat belt, for example, whether he wants it or not, hold hands while crossing the street, etc.\n- Change the channel: At this age, distraction works like a charm. If you see trouble ahead over an off-limits item, your best bet is to offer up something else. And if your child is becoming upset or overstimulated, suggest another activity or remove her from the situation.\n- Use the 5-minute warning: No one likes to see a good thing end. Give your child a warning before you leave the playground or a friend's home, so it won't be a surprise. Setting expectations for yourself and communicating them clearly to your child can make a world of difference. 'We're leaving in 10 minutes. In 5 minutes, I expect you to get your shoes and socks on and say good-byes.'"

Be calm and composed and treat the child the way you want him to treat you-with love and respect.\n- Keep your cool. This might mean taking a couple of deep breaths and doing some positive self-talk. Of all the tips here, this can be the hardest. But the calmer we are, the calmer our children will be. Studies show that matchin g yelling and aggression do more harm than good.\n- Treat your child's feelings with respect : Acknowledge the child's emotions whether you feel they are justified or not. Whatever your children are experiencing is ' real ' to them, and they need kindness and understanding.\n- Listen. Really listen . Use eye contact and show empathy; really listening goes beyond just hearing what your child is saying. Try to make sense of their issue and show them that you care.\n- Let them know that anger is natural and should be expressed appropriately. Talk to the child once she cools down and discuss various ways she can express her anger.\n- Teach your children different ways of calming and soothing themselves like meditation and prayers, right from childhood.\n- There should be consequences for aggression or violence, but not when it is appropriately expressed anger - if a child is able to say that something is angering her, and not just lash out, this should be encouraged.\n- Teach children practical problem-solving skills, so that they can do something concrete about how they are feeling, instead of acting out their anger and frustration.\n- Don't isolate. Some children need space to calm down, others need a big\nbear hug. Some trial and error method will help you figure out what your child needs. However, if your child needs space, find a way to provide this without isolating him. This can be achieved by using a calm down area or sitting with the child with some activity or even quietly together.\n- Praise calm behaviour whenever you notice that your child has opted not to have a melt-down, but to deal with the issue constructively."

They also have someone to turn to at home when things are not going well at school, which helps them cope."

Therefore, nourish your child with unconditional love and positive attention right from childhood so that he grows up to be confident, with a healthy self-esteem.\n- When children return from school, right from their toddler years, make it a habit to ask them daily about what happened in school. Listen to them attentively and make sure you hear what the child has to say and guide her gently. This will help the child to confide in you.\n- If she is bullied, tell the child to separate herself from the bully as far as possible.\n- Stop letting her play the victim; even if the child does not feel fully confident, help her find ways to show that she is unafraid. Help the child take a stand.\n- If necessary, ask her to report the matter to her teacher/Principal, if the bully belongs to the same school.\n- If required, speak to the teacher/ Principal or the bully's parents yourself in an amicable manner to solve the issue.\n- If necessary, take help from the School Counsellor."

Ask for some time to talk to him or her, from the person who has complained about being bullied by your child. In case of any specific incident, talk to your child in a calm and firm voice to find out the details. Be a good listener and avoid blame. Kids need to\n- understand that it's okay to admit they made a mistake.\n- Ask questions to help him understand how his behaviour affects others: 'Is what you did respectful? Did it hurt someone? Would you want someone to do that to you?' Emphasize fair treatment of all people by saying, 'We don't behave that way in this family because we respect other people, and we don't want other people to treat us that way,' suggests Walter Roberts, a professor of counselor education at Minnesota State University, and author of Working With Parents of Bullies and Victims .\n- Find out the root cause: Find out the root cause of his behaviour. Is it because he wants to be popular or is it due to peer pressure or some other reason? This information will help you to take necessary steps to deter him from his behaviour. Engage him in loving conversations to find out what is going on in his daily life.\n- Talk about the consequences: Make the child understand that he must accept responsibility for his actions and also bear the consequences. Depending on the circumstances, you can take away something your child is attached to, so the consequence will be significant, such as taking away your child's cell phone, reducing TV or video game time, or preventing participation in a social outing.\n- You can also ask your child to write an apology letter. Writing down the incident and detailing a positive way to handle future situations might also help the child.\n- Parent-school partnership: Support the school discipline plan. Let the child understand that the school and parents will always stand together in his interest.\n- Help him build social and emotional skills: Inspire him to be empathetic by involving him in volunteering work. Involve him in extra curricular activities of his interests to engage him positively. Help your child to make good friends."

For example, peer pressure could influence a young person to become involved in sports. This involvement could be positive, leading to exposure to healthy lifestyles and role models, and eventually leading the young person to become a positive role model himself. It can be negative if he becomes addicted to sports and competition, to the detriment of his future.\nAdolescents are more prone to be led astray by peer pressure.

Help him to develop a bond for the unborn child through your conversations.\n- Do not get involved, whenever possible: When children fight, step in only if there's a danger of physical harm. If you always intervene, you risk creating other problems. Let them learn to work out the problems on their own. There's also the\n- risk that you - inadvertently - make it appear to one child that another is always being 'protected,' which could foster even more resentment. By the same token, 'rescued' kids may feel that they can get away with more because they are always being 'saved' by a parent.\n- If you are concerned by the language used or name-calling, it is best to encourage kids to express their anger or frustration by using appropriate words. This will validate what they are feeling about the sibling, but will stop them from using hurtful and toxic language just to vent their emotions.\n- If you do step in, try to resolve problems with your kids, not for them. When getting involved, here are some steps to consider:\n- o Separate kids until they are calm\n- o Ask the most upset child to describe the incident first\n- o Pay equal attention to both the children and understand the feelings of both\n- o Treat your children as the unique individuals they are. Set aside your assumptions about each child and listen to the particular details of this fight.\n- o Come up with a list of basic rules for the siblings for conflict resolution\n- o Outside of specific fights, foster love between siblings by\nappreciating their strong points; encourage them to help each other with any weak areas rather than tease each other about them. Get each one to do something for the other and get them to talk about what they like doing together."

Effective discipline recognizes the reasons kids do what they do and works to change those beliefs, rather than merely attempting to change behaviour.\n- Respond to misbehaviour with empathy , not anger or an irritated lecture. Listen to the child's side of the story empathetically and try to reason with her; help her to see the impact her misbehaviour has on herself and others.\nSet limits and boundaries: Taking away privileges and imposing small 'penalties' can be considered, to discipline your child for things like forgetting to put that towel out to dry and dumping it damp on the bed, leaving things strewn around, or brushing teeth in a hurry, being rude or thoughtless, etc. Penalties can be in accordance with the misbehaviour/ undesirable behaviour committed. For example, taking away the mobile phone or taking away TV watching time for a certain period, if the child is glued to the screen or demands to watch it for long hours.\n******"

Ask her about it and listen to her with full attention and interest.Be aware of your child's curriculum, take a look at the text books through the year.\n- Do not miss any parent-teacher meetings so that you are aware of your child's progress and your child's teachers know you and your child personally. Show genuine respect and build a good rapport with them. In case of disagreements, sort it out respectfully.\n- Understand and accept your child's abilities and help her to strengthen and build on them.\n- Identify areas of weakness and underperformance, if any, in your child and find out the reasons. Talk to the child and her teachers to find ways to improve. Find ways to dismantle fear or dislike about any particular school subject.\n- Tell them that the best way to crack subjects is to grow to enjoy them.

One to two hours of study daily, depending on her class, is enough.\n- Ensure that she revises the day's textbook portion 3 to 5 times. This will help her to understand the lesson, learn spellings and grammar to a great\n- extent. Written homework should be done after this, preferably without referring to the textbook.\n- Tuitions should be avoided as the child may stop paying attention in the school. She will not get time to relax and she may become angry and frustrated. It is a drain on the parents' pocket too.\n- Ensure that your child gets enough time for free play.\n- Help her develop at least one hobby, which she enjoys.\n- Do not compare your child with others; do not burden her with your ambitions; instead encourage her to exceed her own performance.\n- Don't worry too much if your child is not getting very good marks.

When you talk with your child (and others) in a respectful way, this gives them a powerful message about positive communication.\n- Set aside time for talking and listening to each other . Family meals can be a great time for this.\n- Keep an open mind, be non-judgmental - this facilitates conversation.\n- Talk about everyday things as you go through your day. If you and your child are used to having lots of conversations, it can make it easier for both of you to talk when big or tricky issues come up.\n- Try not to jump in, cut your child off, or put words in his mouth - even when he says something that sounds ridiculous or wrong or is having trouble finding the words.\n- Be open to talking about all kinds of feelings, including anger, joy, frustration, fear and anxiety. This helps your child develop a 'feelings vocabulary'. Talking about feeling angry is different from getting angry. Learning the difference is an important step for a child learning to communicate.\n- Watch facial expressions and body language and try to respond to\nnon-verbal messages too. For example, 'You're very quiet this afternoon. Did something happen at school?'\n- Cross check and confirm that you have understood what your child is saying by rephrasing when necessary - this demonstrates to the child that you care, and are trying to understand him or her fully.\n- Build on what your child is telling you and show your interest by saying things like 'Tell me more about ...', 'Really!' and 'Go on ...' This sends your child the message that what he has to say is important to you.\n- Emphasize the importance of honesty by encouraging and supporting your child to tell the truth - and praising him when he does. And by being honest yourself!\n- Speak to your child not down at him - this is a confidence booster and encourages more open communication.\n- Keep comparisons to nil - if a child feels that he is not measuring up to some standard in your head, he will shut down communication.\n- Maintain eye contact when you are having a conversation with your child, no matter how brief.

Teach them to be kind and considerate to people around.\n- Physical activities: Encourage your child to stay physically active by letting them choose the activities they enjoy. This could be swimming, biking or just running outdoors. Staying physically active as a child will eventually become a part of their routine as they grow older.\n- Set strong ground rules: As a parent, it is extremely important for you to set down rules for your children right from an early age, particularly about what is simply not going to be tolerated, for example, yelling or throwing things, or littering, or any of the behaviours that are a no-no in the house or in public. It is important to set some kind of routine when it comes to personal habits. Make a flexible routine with slots for play, homework and screen time. Keep adequate time for free play as it helps in both physical and mental development.\n•\nEncourage reading books\n:\nReading out stories to your child makes a significant difference. Good literature has an effective way of inspiring\n- children to behave in a correct manner, to follow a code of discipline, and to maintain a positive outlook in life. A habit of reading will be great in the long run for your child's intellect as well.\n- Be realistic with your expectations : Encourage children to learn from their mistakes. Setting realistic goals and limits are key to adopting any new behaviour.\n- Be generous with your praise : Children do not like to hear what they cannot do, so tell them what they can do instead - focus on those good habits that they are managing to successfully acquire. Keep it fun and positive. Everyone likes to be praised for a job well done. Celebrate successes and help children and teens develop a positive self-image in the process."

It has a very significant effect on the academic performance of children regardless of their family backgrounds.\n'Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary.' - Jim Rohn\nReading is more than a mere hobby. Books fuel the reader's imagination, keep their brain active and make children  more creative. Books have the power to transport the reader into many different worlds.\nThere is no right age to pick up the first book, but the sooner we begin, the better it is. 'There are many little ways to enlarge your child's world. Love of books is the best of all.' - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis."

When kids see their parents reading books or the morning paper daily, they are more likely to develop the same habits.\n- All good habits should begin from an early age, reading is no different. The early years are crucial for a child's development and hence an ideal time to inculcate the reading habit in them. Children get to experience the world through the books and stories they read.\n- Start reading early to them. They will start looking forward to this daily routine. Read to them before bedtime. Dramatic and fun sound effects, hand motions, facial expressions, and changes in tone help sustain their attention. Your child will adore seeing your silly side.\n- Use books to trigger conversation: Books with rich illustrations are ideal as this kindles the child's curiosity. Use illustrations to point out colours, shapes, and counting. Relate the content to real life. Ask open-ended questions (who, what, where, and why) to children of age 3 and older. A word of caution: do not turn it into a 'lecture' and a 'quiz' too often, and keep the enjoyment element in mind.\n- It will be ideal if you could set apart a reading time for the whole family . Read together for 15 to 20 minutes every day.\n- Surround children with books. Encourage them to exchange books with their friends. Enroll in the local library and take them there regularly.\n- Taking kids to bookshops and allowing them to explore and pick-up books of their liking is another easy and fun way to develop kids into voracious readers.\n- Let your children see you enjoying a book or an article or the newspaper; if you have dropped the habit, pick it up again!"

Start the timer and ask the\nkids to sit still and be silent for as long as\n- possible. Whoever does it for the longest time is the winner.\n- Get creative: In situations where you need to wait for a while, in queues, or waiting rooms or at the train station or airport, get creative with the little ones by asking them to come up with a story, but one where they must take turns and say only one sentence at a time. It should be a fun game for all kids.\n- Work on a puzzle: Get a big enough puzzle to keep your child entertained for a while. Having to work on something for a while before getting to see the results really builds patience in a child.\n- Grow a plant: Even after it is planted, a seed will take some time to grow into a plant, and your child will experience her hard work bearing fruits slowly.\n- Bake: Measuring the ingredients and waiting for the baked goods to cook through and cool requires patience from your child; of course, it comes with some scrumptious rewards at the end of it.\n- Passing the parcel: Wrap a present in many layers and hand it over to the kids. Ask them to take turns opening the layers. This will teach them patience in a fun way.\n- Acknowledge their boredom: When your child complains that she would rather be playing or doing something other than waiting, first accept and acknowledge that the child is bored or impatient. Then work with your child to come up with some way to go through the time, creatively. This way, you help her accept that the wait is inevitable, but the time can be used well."

Sometimes it's big like the death of a loved one. Some of these can be quite difficult to navigate, let alone recover from.\nThanks to neuroplasticity-the brain's ability to grow and change in response to experience-we can rewire our brains for better resilience. By practicing more positive human connection, body-oriented therapies, and various types of relaxation training, among other techniques, we can change the wiring in our brains so that we become less reactive and more open to healthy processing of emotional stress.\nA child/adult can be trained or train himself to be resilient. The purpose of practicing a resilience skill is to increase emotional well-being in the face of events that can lead to physical and emotional upset.\nSince resilience is a sign of maturity, it has direct correlation to societies.

    "context_enriched_content": "How to Foster Resilience:\n- Practice Mindfulness : There is mounting evidence that Mindfulness breeds resilience.\n- Practice Self-Compassion: This practice helps one to accept one's fears and shortcomings while also learning to change. It has three steps\n- o Be mindful and self-aware. Without judging say to yourself - 'this hurts' 'this makes me unhappy'. In the case of a child, help him articulate and pinpoint the feeling.\n- o Remind the child he/she is not alone; help the child share his/her fears with you. Lend the child your ear, offer solutions or options without being judgmental.\n- o Teach the child to be kind to himself - after he has expressed himself about what is bothering him, you can encourage him with words like: 'these things happen to everyone. We just have to learn to accept them, learn from our mistakes and move on'.\n- o Help him look at the situation in a broader context and keep a longterm perspective. Although your child may be too young to consider a long-term look on his own, help him see that there is a future beyond the current situation and that the future can be good.\n- Nurture a positive self-view : Help your child remember ways that he or she has successfully handled hardships in the past and then help him understand that these past challenges help him build the strength to handle future challenges. Help him see how whatever he is facing can teach him 'what he is made of.'\n- Change the narrative: The practice of Expressive Writing can move us\nforward by helping us gain new insights on the challenges in our lives. It involves free writing continuously for 20 minutes about an issue, our feelings and thoughts around it. It is important to be sincere and factual in your writing. For a younger child it would be helpful if an adult does the writing as the child narrates.\n- Move toward your goals: Teach your child to set reasonable goals and then to move toward them one step at a time. Moving toward that goal - even if it's a tiny step - and receiving praise for doing so will focus your child on what he has accomplished rather than on what hasn't been accomplished, and can help build the resilience to move forward in the face of challenges.\n- Face your fear: We can help our children to face everyday fears that get in the way of life, such as the fear of animals, heights, or flying, by exposing them to it in small doses. The first step is to slowly, and repeatedly, expose yourself to the thing that scares you - in small doses. For example, children with a fear of animals can be gradually introduced to gentle pets of friends and taught to care and play with the pet, and in this way, slowly and steadily face and overcome the fear.\n- Make connections: Build a strong family network and encourage your child to build a network of friends to support through his inevitable disappointments and hurt.\n- Accept that change is part of living: Change can be scary for children and teens. Help your child see that change is part of life and new goals can replace goals that have become unattainable.\n******"

Here are some practices and tips which may help you to achieve this.\n- Lead by example : 'One of the most important things we adults can do for young children is to model the kind of person we would like them to be'- Carol Hillman, educationist and author. Parents themselves must be happy, compassionate and courageous, if they wish their children to be so. Practices like yoga, meditation, mindful breathing techniques like pranayam, chanting, walking, running, cycling, swimming etc. will assist us in this direction. These practices will help a parent to be not only physically fit but also mentally and spiritually strong.\n- Practice Mindfulness and Gratitude : Mindfulness and Gratitude practices have great health benefits - physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Make these a part of your daily life and become better role models for your children.\n- Reflect on your own childhood. How was it? How different are your child's attitudes and behaviour from yours? This reflection will help you to understand and empathize with your child. This way, you will build on the good things that you experienced as a child, and avoid some of the errors and oversights that the adults in your life made in your upbringing. A word of caution: do not be led purely by 'when I was young, my parents were very strict, so now I will be just the opposite with my child.' Understand your growing years, do not be defined by them as a parent yourself.\n- Identify and write down the character strengths which you wish your child to have. Reflect on whether you have those character strengths yourself and whether they are part of your everyday interactions. If you need to, make efforts to imbibe them and practice them first so that your children are inspired to follow your example. It is not easy; but do try, so that your children see your own genuine efforts in this direction; talk to them about how you are trying to become more patient or more compassionate or more forgiving - whichever character strengths you specifically think are important for your child to imbibe.\n- Importance of touch: Touch is essential for babies' physical, emotional and eventually social health . Studies show infants who experience more physical contact with caregivers demonstrate increased mental development in the first six months of life compared to young children who receive limited physical interaction. Infants who receive above-average levels of affection from their mothers are shown to be less likely to be hostile, anxious, or emotionally distressed as adults. The need for touch is there throughout our lives. So, hug your child more often, whether he is a child or a teenager. If adolescents and teenagers are at times awkward about one-on-one hugs, try a regular family group hug!\n- Listen to your child with full attention and empathy so that your child feels confident to share her greatest fears and problems with you. Also, let your kids talk about their dreams, what they want to do, what things they want, without squashing them to be 'realistic' all the time. From this kind of freedom to share their fears as well as their little victories\n- as well as their plans, however young they are, comes the ability to express and feel heard.\n- Love your child unconditionally. Your child should feel that you love him unconditionally; your love is not dependent on his achievements. You can get angry at his mistakes and not at him. This will make him emotionally secure and help him to have high self-esteem.\n- Give your child ample praise and appreciation. Ensure that you mention what aspect of her behaviour you're appreciating, as it will help to reinforce that behaviour. For example, instead of saying, 'You are the best' say, 'I loved the way you spoke to the maid. You were so kind and loving.' Or praise your son when he shares and enjoys sharing. Too often, parents fall into the old trap of only pointing out what a child did wrong, and taking good behaviour for granted. Make sure that you appreciate your child, genuinely, and not just as a 'strategy'."

This will help your child to be engaged and have some direction in life. This means that you would need to take or arrange to take a child to learn a hobby, an art, a craft, a sport, a musical pursuit, etc. Again, when a child sees his parents enjoying their own hobbies and interests, even in a small way, over and above work, this goes a long way.\n- Play with your child. Bring yourself to your child's level and partake in his wonders and joys - whether it is with a game that they are discovering, or a cartoon that they watch or a book that they like or a puzzle, etc. Children simply love to have their parents take part in their games. It is a win-win situation - your child will feel loved, and you, a little stress-free!\n- Involve your child in household chores: Involving children in ageappropriate chores at home will go a long way in developing a sense of responsibility in them. Inspire children to save water, paper, and electricity and keep their surroundings clean. Get them to help in the kitchen in small ways, lay the table, and other such work, even if you have domestic help.\n- Tell your child plenty of stories. The famous Nobel Laureate Physicist Albert Einstein once said, 'If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be very intelligent, read them more fairy tales.' Historically, tribal communities have used storytelling to share language, traditions, and beliefs from one generation to another. Tell your children a lot of stories from our scriptures and traditions, the classics, as well as modern-day favourites. Instead of asking them the moral of the story, ask them questions like:\n- -What did you like the most and the least about the story and why?\n- -Which character did you like the best and the least and why?\n- -Would you like to have a different ending to the story? If yes, how?\n- -What did you learn from the story?\nSuch questions will help children to enhance their creativity, thinking skills and help them to be empathetic. And you will get a good sense of how your children think, how they feel. It is refreshing for you too, to listen to their perspective, their way of looking at things.\n- Spend quality time with your child. Ensure that you spend some quality time with your child, by being with him fully, not getting distracted by your phone or work. Be in the moment with your child so that he knows that you respect and care about him. This will help your child to be emotionally secure and help you develop stronger bonds. A distracted half-listening parent, which is what many kids experience, is a lose-lose situation for both, parent and child, however long that time is.\n- Create family rituals: Family rituals help in better bonding, developing good habits in children, and creating good memories. Adopt one or more of these practices:\n- o Gratitude and Mindfulness practices every day for at least 5 to 10 minutes; dinner time is ideal for this\n- o Evening prayers/bedtime prayers for universal well-being and prosperity, in whatever form your family/ community prays\n- o Bedtime hugs\n- o Having at least one meal together\n- o Have a family hour (daily or weekly) where all the members sit together and chat and have fun. Play some board games, antakshari, dumb charades, etc.\n- o A good exercise is for everyone to share how their day went. Some talking points are:\n- What are you grateful for today?\n- What kind act did you perform today? How did you feel?\n- Was anyone kind to you today? How did you feel?\n- Did you commit any mistake today? How do you feel about it? What do you want to do about it?\nQuestions can be changed creatively, to suit whatever is currently going on in your and their lives."

When you make friends with your child's friends and their parents, you can support and groom your children together. Invite your child's friends, who can be a good influence, to your home, take them for outings, play games with them and chat with them part of the time that they are together. The famous adage 'It takes a village to raise a child' still stands good, especially in the context of today's nuclear families and safety issues.\n- Provide kids with real life experiences: Besides vacations and other enjoyable activities, find other enriching things to do. Get involved with local NGOs as part of 'giving back to the community'. Take your child with you and engage in different service projects. This will help your child see other lives from close quarters. It will also kindle gratitude in them for what they have and compassion for those who have to make do with very little.\n******"
