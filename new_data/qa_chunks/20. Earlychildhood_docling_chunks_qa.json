    "context_enriched_content": "Preface\nIt  has  been  established  by  researches  that  Early Childhood Education (ECE) of two to three years duration helps young children to do well in their school education and later life. It also helps to provide proper developmental opportunities  to  children  and  creates  among  them  a readiness to learn. It requires a stress free and interesting environment for children to progrerss. But various schools that are providing early childhood education have been found  exceeding  their  limits  and  putting  unnecessary pressure  and  academic  burden  on  pre-schoolers  by stressing  on  formal  teaching  of  reading,  writing  and number work. These practices appear to have encouraged parents to subject children in the age-group of 3-6 years to the pressure of formal education. It is very important for  both  parents  and  teachers  to  understand  that  they have  a  valuable  contribution  to  make  towards development of children at early years without burdening the young mind. It is for these reasons that parents and teachers need to have a clear understanding of the nature and quality of ECE appropriate for children at this stage.\nAccordingly guidance about education at ECE stage assumes paramount significance for both teachers and parents as to when and what kind of pre-school education is needed for their children. Imparting education to young children is not only the responsibility of the school but also of the parents wherein meaningful play is necessary for the child's proper development. It does not mean that the child should be burdened through the formal kind of teaching at home.\nThere  is  sufficient  research  evidence  available  to suggest  that  the  six  years  of  the  child's  life  are  very important  for  life  long  learning.  These  years  are  the foundation years when young children learn to become\nsocialbe  human  beings.  It  has,  therefore,  become  very necessary  to  sensitize  parents,  teachers,  teachereducators and also the policy makers about ECE. Keeping this in mind the present booklet follos a holistic approach on  the  crucial  related  to  ECE  and  provides  a  realistic view of ECE for teachers and parents to meet this premise.\nIt should help develop an understanding among them about should and what should not constitute ECE.\nIt  is  hoped that this manual will help create proper awareness about ECE among citizens of the Country in general  and  parents  and  teachers  in  particular. Suggestion of the readers for further enhancing quality of this document would be welcome.\nRAJENDER KAPOOR, Assistant Professor, DEE, NCERT ROMILA SONI, Assistant Professor, DEE, NCERT K.K.

In the absence of dedicated and enthusiastic citizens,  all  the  resources  may  go  waste.  For  the progress of a nation, human resource development is dependent on education. It is for this reason that Article  45  under  the  Directive  Principles  of  the Constitution of India, aims at the universalisation of primary education. Under Article 21A through 86th Amendment of the Constitution, free and compulsory education  to  children  in  the  age  group  6-14  has become a fundamental right. In addition to this, in Article 45 of the Directive Principles, early childhood care  and  education  for  children  up  to  the  age  of 6 years has been recommended. Research has shown that,  generally,  the  children  who  seek  admission directly  to  Class  I  are  not  prepared  for  primary education  both  physically  and  mentally.  Just  as education is essential as readiness for life, similarly, early childhood education is necessary as readiness for formal education. Once this fact dawned on the people,  their  attention  was  drawn  towards  early childhood  education.  Today,  there  is  universal demand for early childhood education in the whole world."

    "context_enriched_content": "1.1 EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION - THE INDIAN CONTEXT\nIf  we  consider  the  existing  structure  of  Early Childhood Education (ECE), we discover that there is an abundance of privately managed nursery schools run on a commercial basis in urban areas. On the other  hand,  there  is  a  lack  of  well-organised  and\nappropriately planned primary education service for the children living in rural areas and urban slums. Most  of  the  nursery  schools  are  functioning  as downward  extension  of  primary  schools,  where children are given formal education in reading, writing and mathematics. Thus, there is unnecessary burden on the children. Besides, some nursery schools try to educate children on the basis of foreign principles, which fail to integrate children with their environment and  background.\nTherefore, it is the need of the hour that an ECE programme is developed for the children of this age group in accordance with their needs, competencies and  ability  to  grasp.  It  should  also  suit  their environment  and  accelerate  their  growth  and development.\nA well-planned programme plays a vital role in emphasising and raising the standard of ECE because it enables children to acquire pre-literacy skills which facilitate further education.\nThe  saying As  the  twig  is  bent,  so  is  the  tree inclined ,  confirms  that  whatever  values,  attitudes, desired traits and habits we cultivate in a child are reflected in her/his personality as an adult. ECE is essential for human resource development. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  important  role  and activities of ECE and its impact on children."

    "context_enriched_content": "1.2 THE VIEW OF NATIONAL POLICY ON EDUCATION (NPE),1986\n'Early Childhood' refers to the age group of 0-8 years. It includes the period of infancy as well as pre-school and  early  primary  years.  In  the  Indian  context however  according  to  the  National  Policy  on Education (1986), early childhood refers specifically to the age group of 0-6 years.\nThe NPE has given a great deal of importance to ECE.  Emphasising  the  holistic  nature  of  early childhood  programmes,  it  has  extended  ECE  to include the component of 'care', i.e., Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE). The main elements of care are - health and nutrition.\nThe NPE has viewed ECCE as an important input in  the  strategy  of  human  resource  development.  It has highlighted the need for community involvement in ECCE as well as the need to establish a linkage between Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and ECCE programmes at all levels. The NPE has cautioned  against  the  dangers  of  using  formal methods  of  teaching  and  introduction  of  formal reading,  writing  and  number  work  at  the  early childhood  stage.  Instead,  it  has  highlighted  the significance of playway and activity-oriented methods. The policy has also focussed on the need for early childhood care and education of children belonging to the economically backward strata of society."

Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) requires that young children be provided care, opportunities and experiences that lead to their all-round development - physical, mental, social and emotional and school readiness. A holistic and integrated perspective views the  health  and  nutritional  needs  of  children  as integrally related with their psychosocial/educational development.  The  curriculum  framework  and\n8\npedagogy for ECCE must be based on this holistic perspective, taking into account the various domains of development, the characteristics of children at each sub-stage,  and  their  learning  needs  in  terms  of experiences.\nAn enabling environment for children would be one that is rich in stimulation and experiences, that allows  children  to  explore,  experiment  and  freely express  themselves,  and  one  that  is  embedded  in social  relations  that  give  them  a  sense  of  warmth, security and trust. Playing, music, rhyming, art and other  activities  using  local  materials,  along  with opportunities for speaking, listening and expressing themselves,  and  informal  interaction  are  essential components of learning at this stage. As the children who  come  under  the  purview  of  ECCE  are  a heterogeneous  group,  ranging  from  infants  to  preschoolers,  it  is  important  that  activities  and experiences for them are developmentally appropriate.\nThe  caution  would  be  against  pressurising children  into  the  three  R's  (reading,  writing  and arithmetic)  and  the  early  introduction  of  formal instruction,  i.e.,  against  making  pre-schools  into training centres for admission to primary schools. In fact, the suggestion is that ECCE cover the age group 0-8  years,  i.e.,  so  as  to  include  the  early  primary school  years.  This  is  in  order  that  the  holistic perspective of ECCE and its methodologies (all round and integrated development, activity-based learning, listening and speaking a language before learning to write it, contextually and continuity between home and  school)  can  inform  learning  experiences  of children throughout the childhood stage and lead to a smooth transition into the elementary school stage."

In fact it is even more important to clarify the meaning of the term 'child'.\nA child is a complete human being who has the ability to think, feel and act differently in different situations.  Development refers  to  the  progressive changes in the child's nature, behaviour and body. Through  the  ongoing  process  of  development a  child  learns  to  live  and  adjust  to  her/his environment.\nChild  development  refers  to  the  growth  and changes during childhood. Some of the changes can be seen and measured whereas others are not.\nChild  development  generally  includes  the  first twelve years of life. The twelve years have been divided into the following three stages:\n- /lozenge6 Infancy (0-3 years)\n- /lozenge6 Early Childhood (4-6 years)\n- /lozenge6 Primary (6-12 years)\nThe following aspects are included under child development:\n- /xrhombus Physical and Motor Development\n- /xrhombus Cognitive/Intellectual Development\n- /xrhombus Language Development\n- /xrhombus Social and Emotional Development\n- /xrhombus Development of Creative Expression and Aesthetic Appreciation\n8"

The  rate  of development can be slow or fast depending on the age, but it never stops. Development takes place in stages and each stage influences the next. Each child is  unique  and  grows  and  develops  at  her/his  own pace. All the aspects of development are inter-related and one aspect affects the other. There is a particular duration for the proper development of each and every aspect. Environment and experiences have specific influence on development.\nThe  pattern  of  development  for  children  with special needs is the same. It is possible that children with special needs have a slower rate of development or their development may stop at some stage but the pattern is the same.\nEnvironment has a profound influence on a child's development. In the past, a child lived and interacted not only with her/his parents and siblings but with\nother members of the family also. Such large or joint families  contributed  vitally  to  the  child's  overall development.\nMembers  of  the  family  were  responsible  for massaging and bathing the child, singing lullabies and telling stories. The child thus inculcated the right moral values. Children sometimes became aware of their daily chores around the age of three. They learn by  emulating  elder  members  of  the  family.  Today, because of nuclear families ECE has assumed greater importance. Some of the main reasons for this are given below:\n- /lozenge6 Results  based  on  research  show  that  children who  have  undergone  ECE  can  grasp  easily  at the  primary  level.  ECE  enables  them  to  take full  advantage  of  education  and  facilitates development.\n- /lozenge6 The  joint  family  system  is  fast  disintegrating. Therefore,  the  grandparents  and  other  family members  are  not  available  to  look  after  the children and there is no alternative for parents.\n- /lozenge6 Parents are busy in their jobs.\n- /lozenge6 Modern life style has added to mental tensions.\n- /lozenge6 The  environment  in  the  neighbourhood  is  not as good as it used to be due to rapid deterioration in  human values and sanskars.\n- /lozenge6 Industrialisation has led to migration of families to urban areas.\n- /lozenge6 The number of working mothers is increasing day by  day."

This  is  the  most suitable age for acquiring sanskars . If this period is not utilised properly for the all round development of the  child,  the  damage  cannot  be  easily  rectified. Providing proper care and education to children at this stage will help the country to get capable and dedicated  citizens.  The  need  for  ECE  under  these conditions is obvious.

It takes into consideration the individual needs, interests and competencies of children.\n- /lozenge6 Play is natural to  children.  They cannot  sit  quietly whether  it  is  the playground,  home, market or any other place. They begin to play  with  whatever they get, it could be a pebble, a leaf, or anything. They love to play and enjoy it thoroughly.\nMost of the people believe that play is a waste of time. Quite often parents are afraid that play may lead to a quarrel. What is the use of play? If the child reads or writes at least she/he will learn something. Parents  don't  give  enough  opportunities  for  play. Infact, for children, play and work mean the same. In the  early  childhood  years,  play  is  the  only  mean of learning.\nChildren  can  express  their  ideas  and  feelings through  play.  Besides,  they  can  observe  and understand the world around them. It also helps to build  social  relations  and  healthy  habits  among children. Play is thus valuable in promoting the all round  development  of  a  child.  Play  becomes  an effective  medium  for  imparting  ECE.  Knowledge acquired  by  means  of  play  will  always  stay  with the child.\n- /lozenge6 Play  is  helpful  in  developing  the  five  senses  of a child.\n- /lozenge6 Play involves the use of senses and limbs.

While planning such a programme, children's developmental level, social background, cultural traditions and local conditions should be kept in mind.\nBased on the long-term plan, short-term planning must be done. Short-term planning means drawing up a monthly or weekly plan, which should include objectives and specific activities for each of the days of the week. The long-term plan should be drawn up at the beginning of the academic year whereas the weekly plan could be prepared before the new week commences.

The child  acts  and  reacts  on  getting  appropriate opportunities. She/he learns from these actions and reactions,  and  this  in  turn  speed  up  her/his development. The initial interaction of a child is with her/his parents. She/he spends most of the time with the family. We all know, that, it is the duty of the parents to bring up the child, but this should not be limited to merely providing nutritious food or clean clothes  to  the  child.

There are also some parents who are ignorant about such activities and thus  burden  the  child  with  unnecessary  formal education at home. Due to socio-cultural changes, indian  mothers  are  gradually  leaving  old  customs and  traditions.  The  joint  family  system  is  fast disintegrating and families are migrating from their original  place  of  residence.  The  traditional  ways  of bringing up children are rapidly changing. Old songs, stories,  play,  home  made  toys,  which  parents  and grandparents,  commonly  used  at  home  are  now  a thing of the past.\nThe  joint  family  system  also  had  another advantage. Children of close relatives lived in the joint\nfamily.  They  played together, ate together and learnt from each other  (peer  learning). There  is  no  such possibility  in  today's nuclear families.\nTherefore, parents should  use  games, activities  inherited from our rich cultural\nheritage,  stories  and  songs  related  to  child development.  The  child  is  thus  guided  to  learning indirectly through interactions with the members of the family everyday.\nLeft to themselves, children will imbibe whatever they see in their environment, whether right or wrong, as they cannot discriminate at this stage. But when parents create a caring learning environment at home, the  child  feels  secure  and  develops  curiosity. Therefore,  teachers  and  parents  should  jointly  try to  create  conditions  conducive  to  the  child's learning  and  development.  Parental  cooperation implies, they should be involved in the planning and implementation  of  the  ECE  programmes  and discharging their role to the best of their ability. These days an entrance test is  being  conducted  even  for admission to nursery classes and later the children are pressurised to learn at a very young age. Such approach  not  only  burdens  children  but  also  the parents. The teacher and the parents have a vital role in moulding the lives of children. Parents should not unnecessarily burden the child on the contrary they should  play  with  the  child.  Children  learn  while playing. In addition to this, the parents should collect information regarding activities that not only interest the child but are motivating.\n8\nParents must ensure the following at home in order to motivate the child.\n- /lozenge6 Spend quality time with the child.\n- /lozenge6 Converse  with  the  child.  Provide  maximum opportunity to the child to speak.\n- /lozenge6 Make the child feel loved and secure.\n- /lozenge6 Sing songs, recite poems, tell stories to the child and let her/him do the same.\n- /lozenge6 Play with the child as a companion.\n- /lozenge6 Give proper guidance to the child.\n- /lozenge6 Avoid criticising.\n- /lozenge6 Listen patiently to the child.\n- /lozenge6 Take the child outdoor and make her/him aware of  her/his  surroundings.  Draw  the  child's attention to the changes taking place around her/ him in the environment.\n- /lozenge6 Avoid comparing the child with others. Every child has a different potential.\n- /lozenge6 Provide her/him games, toys, picture books and activities  according  to  her/his  age,  level  and ability.\n- /lozenge6 Activities, toys and games should be meaningful for the child's development.\n- Be a role model for the child.\n- /lozenge6 Respond  to  the  child's  queries  and  encourage her/him to explore. Avoid scolding the child even if she/he questions repeatedly.\n- /lozenge6 Provide  a  tension-free  environment  at  home  so that the child feels secure.\n- /lozenge6 Let the children learn from their own experiences by  touching,  smelling,  tasting  and  examining things carefully.\nre"

Even, if they don't have enough time, it is their duty to narrate stories, because children enjoy listening to these.  It  increases  their  knowledge,  imagination and  vocabulary. They  also  develop  an  interest in reading.\nChildren are delighted when parents or any other member of the family joins them in singing or playing. They feel secure. But the pace of life has become so fast these days that parents hardly get time with their children. Due to their pre-occupation with everyday chores. They are gradually forgetting their traditional role like telling stories and singing songs. We should try to revive these as they help to instill good sanskars in children. It is the family and parents alone who can lay the foundation for good sanskars .\nIf  children  get  sufficient  food,  love and motivation in the initial years, it  will  have  a  positive  impact  on their  future  life  and  education.

It  should  be  made  an  essential component of the Class I syllabus.\n- /lozenge6 ECE is a special type of education and is different from education at all other levels.

ECE  is  the  beginning  of education. We should not expect any previous knowledge from a child seeking admission to ECE. Therefore, there should be no entrance test for such young children.\n- /lozenge6 A  lot  of  stress  is  given  to  learning  of  formal reading,  writing  and  learning  work  in  the nursery classes.\nInstead  in  ECE,  we should  prepare  such young children for formal learning of reading, writing, mathematics e.g., before  a  child  begins formal writing, we should provide writing readiness activities  like  stringing beads,  joining  dots  and strokes  (straight  and slanting).  We  should  not consider  ECE  to  be  a downward  extension  of  primary  education  and consequently attempt to teach the formal reading, writing and learning work at this stage.\nChildren  are  by  nature  curious  and  like  to explore.  Hence,  we  should  provide  them  an appropriate environment for getting different kind of experiences themselves and help them to draw their own conclusions.\n- /lozenge6 It is incorrect to give homework to such small children. The aim of ECE is to make the school environment interesting and enjoyable. 3 R's should  not  be  given  importance.  Therefore, there should be no homework.\n- /lozenge6 It has been generally found that many nursery schools  run  ECE  programmes  as  they  like. Instead  of  a  readiness  programme,  formal teaching of 3 R's is still done. This harms the children instead of benefitting them. We should frame a law so that only teachers trained in ECE can teach the nursery classes.\nhot\n- /lozenge6 ECE programmes need related literature and teaching learning materials. There is a need for preparing a kit containing play materials required for all the aspects related to overall development of the child. The kit should be reasonably priced and made available to all concerned.\n- /lozenge6 For uniformity there should be a common daily and annual programme of ECE to be followed by all the schools dealing with ECE.\n- /lozenge6 ECE methods should also be used in Classes I and II.\n- /lozenge6 Teachers, teaching Classes I and II should follow the child-centred approach and adopt interesting teaching methodologies.
