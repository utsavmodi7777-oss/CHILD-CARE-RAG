    "context_enriched_content": "Preface\nThe Handbook of Parenting and Child Development Across the Lifespan was written to bring together in one book the most important theory and empirical findings relating to the parent-child relationship. We wanted to build a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding all aspects of the parenting role, and how parenting practices influence children's and young  people's  development  across  the  lifespan.  To  do  this,  we  invited leading parenting researchers from around the world who had made important contributions to the parenting literature. This goal of bringing together a diverse body of evidence spanning genetics, cognitive neuroscience, child development,  and  research  on  prevention  and  intervention  science  was challenging: individual contributions tend to be quite specialized and the links between basic scientific research on parenting and child development do not always inform research or policy on parenting intervention in the context of prevention and treatment.\nWe structured the volume into six parts. We begin with important foundational information relating to understanding the psychological processes and mechanisms that explain how differences in parenting influence children's development. In Part I we consider the role, functions, and tasks of parenthood. Next, we discuss the biological factors that influence parenting, the role of attachment in understanding the parent-child relationship, the effects of interparental relationships, and fathers on children's development. We then consider how family functioning can be affected by disruptive events such as exposure to natural disasters, war, and becoming a refugee.\nPart II explores how parenting affects children's development, including brain  architecture  and  function,  language,  communication  and  cognitive development, children's emotions and capacity for self-regulation, their relationships with peers, their health, physical activity and nutritional status, and finally how parenting influences children with specific developmental disorders. What becomes apparent in this section is the pervasiveness of parental impact on children's lives.\nPart III asks the question of how being a parent influences a parent's life and capacity to parent. Many of the chapters in this section adopt a broad social ecological perspective. Parents are not simply born knowing how to care for and educate children, and learning how to parent is influenced by multiple contextual issues including the child's temperament and characteristics, a parent's capacity to self-regulate their own emotions and behavior and  their  cognitive  functioning  (including  expectations  and  attributions).\nImportantly  the  kind  of  social  support  parents  can  access  from  partners, extended family and friends, religious organizations, and the workplace influences how stressful parenting can become. Disruptive family relationships that  come about through separation and divorce experiences can influence parents' relationships with their children and can be very stressful as parents seek to create a new life for themselves in a changing family arrangement. This section also explores basic social conditions of living in communities and neighborhoods and the impact of housing conditions on parenting and child development. We end this section with a chapter addressing policies and services as a context that supports the parenting role and how this in turn influences parental functioning and children's development.\nPart IV turns to the issue of how the parenting role changes across different phases of development from infancy, toddlerhood, the preschool years, through school-age children, adolescents and emerging adults, adult children, and parenting during the later years of life. We discuss the unique challenges of parenting children of different ages. Each stage of development brings new challenges, but each stage is still fundamentally focused on promoting the well-being of children. The parent role involves a lifelong commitment to offspring and can both positively and adversely affect parents and children, even as children become adults, then parents and grandparents themselves.\nPart V turns to the issue of how best to support parents in their role. It begins with a consideration of the broader social ecology of parenting and the adverse effects of poverty on families. We discuss the role of parenting programs in preventing social and emotional problems in children and parenting, and family intervention programs in the treatment of child behavioral and emotional problems. The final Part VI turns to the implications of the prior research on parenting for policy development and practice. We make the case for a multilevel system of evidence-based parenting support within a population health framework and discuss the economic benefits of investments in parenting programs. We end by considering possible future directions for parenting research, practice, and policy. Our fundamental conclusion is that substantial progress has been made in understanding the critical role of parenting in influencing children's development, and importantly a range of evidencebased parenting programs are now being disseminated widely throughout the world to benefit parents and children. However, there is so much more to do, and only a tiny  fraction  of  the  world's  population  of  parents  access  these programs,  with  the  vast  majority  learning  their  parenting  role  on  the  job through trial and error learning.\nBrisbane, QLD, Australia\nMatthew R. Sanders Alina Morawska"

Being a parent can  be  a  wonderfully  fulfilling  role  that  brings immense joy, pride and happiness to the lives of parents. At times, the parenting role can also be challenging,  and  for  some  it  can  become  quite overwhelming. In essence, parenting is easier and less stressful when families live in environments that are conducive to good parenting. Features of such an environment include living in a stable, supportive home with caring, capable and involved  parents  that  have  access  to  regular employment, secure housing, high quality early childhood  education  and  care,  good  schools, affordable health and dental care, safe play and recreational  facilities,  and  extended  family  and social supports. However, parenting takes place in a wide variety of socioeconomic circumstances and children begin life in diverse situations that\nM. R. Sanders (\n*\n) · K. M. T. Turner\nParenting and Family Support Centre, School of\nPsychology, The University of Queensland,\nBrisbane, QLD, Australia e-mail: m.sanders@psy.uq.edu.au;\nkturner@psy.uq.edu.au\nWhen  parenting  occurs  in  communities  that support parenting, value the parenting role, and have  safe,  low  crime  neighborhoods,  children, parents and the community benefit. Conversely, too many children live in homes with few of the advantages above, where daily living is a struggle, and family members are exposed to chronic stress. For example, an estimated 17% of Australian  children  under  the  age  of  15  live  in poverty (up from 15% a decade earlier), and 22% of children are developmentally vulnerable, with more  developmentally  vulnerable  children  in low-income areas and Indigenous families (Australian Institute of Health and  Welfare, 2017). When parents are socially  isolated  from partners due to relationship breakdown, and have little  or  no  access  to  extended  family  support, raising  children  solo  can  be  a  very  demanding responsibility. Other stressful life circumstances include parents being exposed to violence (intimate partner, domestic, or community violence), experiencing or living with someone with serious mental  health  issues,  substance  abuse,  chronic physical health problems, homelessness, or involvement  with  the  criminal  justice  system. High  levels  of  stress  diminish  parental  selfefficacy  (Crnic  &  Ross,  2017)  and  parenting capacity. Children raised in toxic family environments  are  vulnerable  over  their  life  course  to developing serious social, emotional, health, and\nmental health problems (Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2016).\nWhen parenting occurs in a very low resource setting,  children's  health  and  development  are adversely affected (American Academy of Pediatrics,  2016).  Many  very  low  resource  settings are affected by high rates of violence, political instability leading to war and internal displacement of people, natural disasters such as floods and landslides, and few financial resources to tackle complex problems like poor sanitation, water, and food security (Mejia,  Calam,  & Sanders, 2012). Everyday life is characterized by high levels of toxic stress, and ensuring children's survival is the major challenge for parents."

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction\nParents differ considerably in their knowledge of  child  development  and  effective  parenting practices, their self-efficacy, and their emotional resilience in undertaking the parenting role. For example, Morawska, Winter, and Sanders (2009) found that parents with greater knowledge about effective  parenting  strategies  tended  to  use  less dysfunctional  parenting,  and  reported  significantly higher education and income levels. Parents with low levels of parenting knowledge and confidence in their parenting skills may be at greater risk of dysfunctional parenting and might benefit  from  interventions  designed  to  enhance both knowledge and confidence. Individual differences in parents' family of origin experiences, financial  and  other  personal  resources,  coping capacities  and  life  opportunities  mean  that  parents start  their  parenting  journey from different starting  points.  Because  of  this  variability,  parents differ in the type of parenting support they need  and  seek  out.  Some  parents  need  a  great deal of support and professional assistance, while others need very little (Sanders, Burke, Prinz, & Morawska, 2017). The level and type of support parents need can change at difference stages of the  life  cycle  (e.g.,  toddlerhood,  adolescence) and  with  changed  family  circumstances  (e.g., divorce, death of a spouse or child).\nA  greater  understanding  of  the  fundamental importance of the parenting role itself is required. This  includes  knowing  how  parenting  shapes children's developmental competence, wellbeing and life course opportunities. It also includes understanding the determinants of par- ents' capabilities to raise their children at different  developmental  stages  and  promote  healthy development. The determinants of parenting are complex (Belsky,  1984). A  host  of  genetic  and biological factors (that are mostly nonmodifiable by parents) interact with environmental and cultural factors (that, in theory, can be changed) to determine the kind of parenting children experience as they grow up. This chapter provides an overview of the importance of the parenting role in  influencing the course of children's development and the determinants of parental behavior, parental knowledge, and parenting practices. We identify  key  modifiable  aspects  of  the  broader ecological context within which parenting takes place and identify implications for research, policy, and practice."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parenting Styles and Practices\nSpera (2005) provides a comprehensive summary of the evolution of our thinking about typologies of parenting styles and parenting practices. Amongst  the  most  impactful  were  Baumrind's early (1971) work detailing three distinct parenting  styles:  'traditional'  authoritarian  parenting (i.e., restricting autonomy, exerting parental control, and punishment), permissive parenting (i.e., allowing  a  child  to  develop  naturally  without imposed authority,  parent  viewed  as  a  resource rather  than  an  active  agent  shaping  a  child's behavior), and authoritative parenting (i.e., encouraging individual autonomy  and  social competence, as well as conformity with expected limits or standards). Maccoby and Martin (1983) expanded upon Baumrind's three styles of parental control by exploring the underlying processes of demandingness (e.g., the number and type of demands parents make) and responsiveness (e.g., sensitivity  to  children's  needs,  contingency  of parental  reinforcement).  Thus,  four  parenting typologies were formed: authoritarian (demanding,  unresponsive),  permissive/indulgent  (undemanding, responsive), authoritative (demanding, responsive)  and  additionally,  neglectful  (undemanding,  unresponsive).  Darling  and  Steinberg (1993) further differentiated parenting style (broader  patterns  and  the  emotional  climate  in\nwhich parents raise their children) and parenting practices (the specific behaviors used by parents to socialize their children, such as teaching and discipline  strategies,  involvement  in  schooling, monitoring). Research continues to focus on the influence  of  parenting  styles  and  practices  on child  social,  emotional,  behavioral,  and  educational development."

The parenting role, according to Hoghughi and Long (2004), involves a set of purposeful activities that ensure the survival, care, development, and well-being of children. It involves a number of  interrelated  functions  that  gradually  change over the course of a child's development. Parents engage  in  multiple  caring  activities,  in  varying contexts throughout a child's life to promote the well-being of their children. How successfully a parent undertakes their parenting responsibilities impacts  on  their  children's  adjustment,  mental health and well-being into adulthood."

Socialization (including the teaching of values, good habits and the selfregulation of emotions and impulses), has been described  as  the  result  of  the  behavioral,  emotional,  and  representational  contingencies  that emerge in the parent-child relationship (Maccoby, 2015). The development of children's social  and  emotional  competencies  helps  children become well integrated into a broader social network and community. The aim is for children to reach adulthood with the prosocial skills, interests,  and  health  habits  needed  to  live  healthy, happy,  and  productive  lives  in  caring  relationships  and  with  motivation  and  skills  to  play meaningful  prosocial  roles  in  society  (Wilson, O'Brien, & Sesma, 2009)."

It  also  involves  providing  consequences  when  children  behave  inappropriately. This requires parents to have clear expectations, rules,  and  planned  strategies  that  they  are  prepared to use as needed to back up an instruction or respond to challenging behavior (e.g., planned ignoring of minor problems, brief removal of an activity  at  the  center  of  a  dispute,  or  strategies like quiet time or time-out for more serious situations).

Parents who have a good relationship with their child's  educator  are  better  able  to  advocate  for their  children  (Sanders,  Healy,  Grice,  &  Del Vecchio,  2017).  This  includes  communicating openly about any concerns they may have about their  children  (e.g.,  behavior  in  class,  learning problems, peer relationship difficulties, grades). Parents are then more likely to be aware of how to  promote  or  consolidate  their  child's  learning outside of school hours and to support the school. Children tend to have fewer social or emotional problems at school when parents actively involve themselves in children's learning and education (Brotman, Basrjas-Gonzalez, Dawson-McClure, &  Calzada,  2018;  Kirby  &  Hodges,  2018). Parents  who  avoid  contact  with  teachers  or  the school in general or make demands, escalate or intimidate  teachers,  tend  to  be  more  poorly informed  about  their  children's  education  and can  be  socially isolated from  other  parents. Parents with personal histories of disliking or not doing well at school themselves often feel apprehensive,  intimidated,  anxious  and/or  avoidant about engaging with the school system. However, communicating  effectively  with  teachers  is  an important relationship skill for parents to learn so they can meaningfully support children's education."

In  turn,  parents influence  children's  religious  beliefs,  attitudes, and  behavior  in  relation  to  social  and  moral issues.  The  family  is  where  children  are  first exposed  to  spirituality,  religious  practices,  cultural  traditions  and  rituals,  and  role  models  for moral and ethical behavior (e.g., honesty, kindness). The attitudes parents express in adult conversations that children hear, or in conversations with children, can influence children's attitudes towards others (e.g., racial groups, minority and marginalized groups, religions), work ethic, sexuality, and intimate relationships (e.g., same- or opposite-sex  relationships,  gender  roles,  marriage, abortion), and social issues (e.g., care for the environment, climate change, politics, war). Parents  have  an  important  role  in  encouraging tolerance, compassion, and acceptance of others (e.g.,  racial,  cultural,  and  religious  differences), and the avoidance of inadvertently teaching children to be prejudiced (Kirby, 2016)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Parenting in Different Family Contexts\nParenting  takes  place  in  many  diverse  family contexts (e.g., nuclear family, single parent, adoptive, blended or stepfamily, foster or kinship care, multigenerational or multiple family house- holds). There is no single right way to raise children and many different parenting arrangements can be made to work or fail. Living arrangements for the care of children can be complex and may change over the course of a child's development by choice or necessity following major changes or  transitions  in  families,  such  as  relationship\nbreakdown, repartnering of parents, incarceration of a parent, death of a parent, or because of displacement, war, or natural disaster.\nAlthough there is no single family configuration  that  is  essential  to  produce  healthy,  welladjusted  children,  there  is  still  some  stigma associated  with  being  raised  in  nontraditional household arrangements in any community. For example,  an  increasing  number  of  children  are being raised in households by gay or lesbian couples  (Biblarz  &  Stacey,  2010;  Oakley,  Farr,  & Scherer, 2017) and, contrary to conservative concerns, parents' sexual orientation has little if any direct impact on children's development (Patterson,  2017).  Children  can  thrive  in  any environment that creates a loving, stable, secure family  context  that  caters  for  children's  social, emotional, and physical needs. Conversely, regardless of the type of parenting situation children are raised in, if children experience harsh, coercive, unpredictable, or chaotic parenting and living  arrangements,  with  high  levels  of  family conflict,  they  are  at  increased  risk  for  adverse developmental  outcomes  (Bright  &  Thompson, 2018; Hughes et al., 2017). In addition, if parents feel unsupported, judged, criticized, and blamed, and cannot access basic assistance (such as quality  parent  education  support  or  paid  parental leave) they can find the task of raising children a challenging one."

    "context_enriched_content": "Social Ecology of Parenthood\nBronfenbrenner's model of human development (Bronfenbrenner, 1986; Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  2006)  provides  a  valuable  conceptual framework for understanding the multiple interacting  determinants  of  parental  behavior.  This influential model  is referred to by multiple authors  in  this  volume  to  describe  the  broader ecological contexts (from proximal to distal) that can influence parenting and ultimately children's development. The family is considered a microsystem  nested  within  a  range  of  other  systems that affect parenting directly and indirectly. Within-family proximal influences include a parent's  mental  health,  the  quality  of  relationships between  parents,  and  child  behavior  problems. More distal influences include interactions between  parents  and  schools,  workplaces,  and health  care  systems  (mesosystemic  influences) and  larger  exosystems  that  include  influences such as economic conditions, political systems, policies, and mass media. These are all embedded within the broader community context of cultural ideologies and values (macrosystem).\nAn important implication of conceptualizing the determinants of parenting as occurring within a multilevel ecological system is that efforts to improve parenting can concurrently target different levels. For example, advocacy for increasing parental  access  to  quality  evidence-based,  culturally  informed  parenting  programs  can  take place through the delivery of specific programs targeting  the  parent-child  relationship.  These programs can be delivered through different service delivery contexts in health, education, welfare,  and  work  settings. Advocacy  for  funding support for parenting programs can occur through engaging with policy makers and contributing to policy development and legislation, and  through  media  communications  targeting end users, parents as consumers, and the wider public (Sanders, 2018). An enabling ecological environment that supports parenting is one where preparation for parenthood at each stage of a child's development becomes socially normative,  usual,  unremarkable,  expected,  free  of stigma, readily accessible, and supported at multiple levels of the ecosystem.\nFigure 1 summarizes how the broader ecological contexts (e.g., policies, laws, type of neighborhood) affecting parenting interact with more proximal psychosocial influences that constitute enablers and barriers to parental behavior change. A range of interacting factors influence specific parental outcomes (e.g., completing a parenting program).  The  types  of  potentially  modifiable enablers and barriers include the features of the program itself and its delivery (appropriate content,  relevant  and  culturally  informed  examples and activities, preferred delivery format), a favorable social context (parent attends with the support  of  a  partner  or  friend),  and  activation  of positive  cognitions  or  emotions  associated  with\nFig. 1 Drivers of change in parenting\nenacting a planned behavior change. Change is more  likely  when  parental  motivation  is  high (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). This occurs when the anticipated benefits are salient, the parent believes they  have  the  capacity  to  change,  the  parent anticipates reinforcers that stem from making a planned  change  (e.g.,  less  stress  because  of improved  child  behavior),  and  the  program  is viewed as a meaningful, desirable, and practical way of addressing a key concern (e.g., reducing learning difficulties)."

Continuities include the need to provide for children's  basic  needs  for  food,  shelter,  clothing, love, emotional support, and a safe, secure environment. Discontinuities include the level of parenting support required as children develop greater  independence  (e.g.,  independent  toileting,  dressing  themselves,  safely  crossing  roads, and using public transport). The capacity to parent  children  confidently  and  competently  also changes over time as parents gain experience and also face new developmental stages."

A  parent's  personal resources  that  express  themselves  in  parenting include  their  knowledge,  education,  experience with  children,  attitudes  towards  child-rearing, and history of relationships including how they were parented themselves as children. Each parent has been exposed to gender-based socialization  experiences  concerning  their  expected  role as a parent, including personal meanings pertaining to being a mother or father (Endendijk et al., 2017). The average age for becoming a parent in Australia  has  increased  substantially  in  the  last 40 years. In 1976, the average age was 25.9 years for mothers and 28.7 years for fathers. In 2016, it was 31.2 years for mothers and 33.3 for fathers.\nThe age span for transition to parenthood is very wide. The proportion of new mothers who were in  their  thirties  increased  from  12%  in  1980  to 28% in 2007. The proportion of new mothers in their late thirties has increased from 2% in 1980 to 12% in 2007, and was higher in 2007 than for the proportion who  were teenagers (Hayes, Weston, Qu, & Gray, 2010). While later parenthood brings greater life experience, it also means potentially less energy and a greater clash with career demands."

To successfully undertake certain parenting tasks (e.g., manage temper outbursts or settle a  crying  baby)  or  formulate  and  successfully execute  a  parenting  plan  (e.g.,  toilet  training  a toddler)  involves  activating  self-regulatory  processes and executive functions (Deater-Deckard, Wang, Chen, & Belland, 2012), including impulse  control,  emotion  regulation,  communication  and  social  skills,  and  problem-solving. Executive  functions  are  a  set  of  cognitive  processes  necessary  for  the  cognitive  control  of behavior  including  selecting  and  successfully monitoring  behaviors  that  facilitate  the  attainment of goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive  processes  such  as  attentional  control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility.  Higher  order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence.\nWhen a parent is dealing with a specific parenting  challenge  such  as  a  child's  whining  or demanding, the parent must activate the following executive function processes:\n1. Attentional processes . The parent needs to pay attention and to tune in to the child's behavior, notice when the whining first occurred, what triggered it and when it stops.\n2. Formulate an explanation . Parents will respond  differently  depending  on  how  they\nunderstand and explain their child's behavior. Parents  will  develop  working  hypotheses  or attributions (causal inferences) about why the problem is occurring. The type of attribution can  affect  how  the  parent  deals  with  the behavior. If a parent believes that the child is engaging in the behavior deliberately to annoy them, they are more likely to blame the child and potentially react with annoyance or voice escalation themselves.\n3. Regulate their emotions . When children engage  in  behavior  that  parents  interpret  as problematic and requiring some kind of disciplinary response, the parent needs to manage their  own  emotions  or  risk  escalation  and potentially harming a child.\n4. Formulating  and  carrying  out  a  parenting plan . Developing a parenting plan that addresses  the  parent's  understanding  of  the reasons a problem has occurred involves the parent gathering sufficient information about the problem and its causes, discussing it with other carers as necessary, working out a strategy to resolve the problem, and implementing the strategy.\n5. Communication with others .  Parents  need  to communicate with partners, grandparents, carers, and teachers about needs of children or actions  they  have  taken  (e.g.,  new  rules  or routines)."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Immediate Couple Relationship\nParents are better able to undertake their parenting responsibilities if they are living in a stable, loving relationship with a partner who can share parenting roles and responsibilities. The relationship  between  parents  has  a  profound  effect  on children  (Halford,  Rhoades,  &  Morris,  2018). Having  a  supportive  partner  means  that,  apart from  having  access  to  greater  emotional  and practical support with parenting tasks and responsibilities, the family is less likely to be living in adverse financial  circumstances.  Having a partner who can be a companion, active contributor, problem-solver, and cocreator of a shared family history  strengthens  a  parent's  capacity  to  cope\nwith  the  demands  of  parenthood.  Parents  who have mutually satisfying relationships tend to be more  collaborative  in  coparenting,  use  positive parenting,  and  children  show  better  adjustment (Zemp, Milek, Cummings, & Bodenmann, 2017). Conversely, when parenting occurs in the context of relationship unhappiness and conflict, parents are  at  greater  risk  of  intimate  partner  violence, depression, and relationship breakdown (Gravningen et al., 2017). Children's exposure to high levels of interparental conflict, particularly parental violence, is a form of chronic toxic stress that increases children's risk of long-term physical and mental health problems (Geffner, Igelman, & Zellner, 2014)."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Interactional Context\nThe  reciprocal  nature  of  parent-child  interactional processes underscores how parenting can be influenced by children themselves, including how they behave in response to parental actions. Social  learning  theory  emphasizes  the  importance of social interactional processes that maintain patterns of problematic interaction between parents  and  children  (Biglan,  2015;  Patterson, 1982).  Many  characteristics  and  behaviors  of children can influence parental behavior, cognitions, and emotions in particular situations. For example,  a  child  who  physically  resembles  an estranged, abusive partner, can evoke distressing emotions and unpleasant memories in the parent, particularly  when  the  child  is  being  difficult  to settle,  challenging,  or  aggressive.  Conversely,  a child who physically resembles their parent in the context of a mutually satisfying couple relationship can evoke many positive parental emotions, thoughts and nurturing actions during the caregiving  process  in  response  to  a  child's  smile, humor, playfulness, positive physical contact, or mannerisms.\nImportantly, parents' behaviors such as picking  up,  holding,  cuddling,  rocking,  smiling  at, soothing, cooing, talking to, singing, or humming that  involve  positive  parent  interactions  can  be reinforced by the child's response. For example, when a child shows pleasure or a positive verbal or emotional response to a parent talking to the child, the parent's child-focused positive verbalization is likely to be reinforced and more likely to be repeated in the future. Conversely, positive parental responses towards children can be weakened  or  reduced  when  children  do  not  respond positively,  or  when  a  child  becomes  distressed after parental attempts to settle them (Sameroff, 2009).\nChildren also have a role in shaping their own social environment. For example, young children with irritable temperaments, sleep or settling difficulties can evoke negative emotional responses in parents (McQuillan & Bates, 2017). This arises in part because parents' efforts to calm, settle or reassure children do not work and are therefore punished  or  extinguished,  leading  to  persistent exposure  of  parents  to  negative  child  behavior. This in turn increases parental stress and risk of coercive  escalation  of  negative  emotion  in  an effort  to  terminate  the  child's  upset.  Unfortunately, a child's capacity to reinforce problem parenting behavior  (shouting,  threatening,  hitting)  can  be part of a self-perpetuating pattern of interaction that concurrently  is associated  with  parental escalation, and increased child behavior problems."

    "context_enriched_content": "Attachment Security\nParent-child attachment can influence (and reflect) parenting style and children's social and emotional development (Moore, Arefadib, Deery, Keyes, & West, 2017). There are two overarching attachment  styles. Secure  attachment  (e.g., a sense of closeness, interdependence, predictability, and confidence in support seeking) is fostered when parents respond to children in a consistent, caring, and timely way. This secure attachment is associated  with  enhanced  developmental  outcomes (e.g., self-regulation, empathy, and social competence), and in turn, is associated with building positive parent-child relationships and making parenting easier. On the other hand, insecure attachment can develop when parents, for whatever  reason,  are  unpredictable,  unavailable  or unresponsive  to  a  child's  needs.  Subgroups  of\ninsecure attachment have been described (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978): avoidant of the parent (e.g., emotionally distant); anxious/ambivalent (e.g., distressed if separated from the parent and difficult to console even when the parent returns); or a disorganized  pattern of attachment (with poor help seeking and emotion regulation, commonly linked to exposure to child abuse, parental psychopathology or social disadvantage). Insecure attachment is associated with increased  likelihood  of  developing  social  and emotional problems (Groh, Roisman, van Ijzendoorn,  Bakermans-  Kranenburg,  &  Fearon, 2012). Due to the bidirectional nature of parentchild interactions, this may feed a cycle of increasingly dysfunctional parenting styles."

Parents with serious mental health issues such  as  depression,  anxiety,  psychosis,  or  substance abuse problems can find the parenting role particularly difficult (Calam & Wittkowski, 2017). For example, a parent with major depression  may  have  disrupted  parenting  practices, such as being less positive, avoiding interactions with the child, or being more inconsistent. When parents are preoccupied with their own negative thoughts or mood they pay less attention to their children, have fewer positive interactions, and are less  likely  to  respond  positively  to  prosocial behavior. Depressed mood can be associated with irrational beliefs ( I'm hopeless as a parent. I just can't do this. Why are other parents so much better  at  this  than  me? ),  and  blaming  attributions ( He always does this, he's just like his fatherselfish and demanding ). Irritability, another common symptom of depression, can lead parents to be impatient, raise their voice in anger, and use harsh, demeaning, or critical words in their interactions with children. This can also be related to being less attuned to their daily needs (e.g., child being hungry). Feeling tired and exhausted can be associated with withdrawing from interacting with children and can impair a parent's capacity to effectively monitor and supervise. Children of parents with a mental illness can be confused by the change in the parent's behavior when they are unwell,  and  can  become  distressed  by  the  parent's  altered  emotional  state.  Chronic  mental health concerns are associated with greater risk of children developing serious mental health and behavior problems themselves (Weissman et al., 2006)."

This includes having a peer or friendship network that can be relied upon for emotional and practical support in raising children. Having access to the experience and wisdom of other parents, or people interested in the welfare of children, provides a valuable source of information and emotional support that can promote a parent's ability to deal with unfamiliar or difficult parenting situations  particularly  for  parents  of  children  with special  needs  (Wang,  Huang,  &  Kong,  2017). Parents who raise their children in a context of relative social isolation (e.g., due to family breakdown or estrangement, moving to a new area, or in migrating or refugee families) can experience more  parenting  difficulties  than  other  parents. Parents  who  have  children  with  special  needs (e.g.,  ASD,  intellectual impairment, learning problems,  ADHD,  chronic  or  life  threatening health problems, physical disabilities, gifted and talented students, and multiple births) are particularly likely to feel socially isolated if they are unable to  connect  with  other  parents  who  have children with similar issues. Support groups for parents of children with special needs enable parents to feel part of a community of other parents. However, it should also be noted that some parents' available social networks can also be coercive  and  a  source  of  criticism,  hostility  and disapproval. In this context, parents often avoid contact because of anticipated criticisms and the associated distress they can experience."

Grandparents  are  often  involved  in  providing considerable  amounts  of  childcare  assistance, enabling parents to return to work and undertake out of home activities. Poor communication, criticism and conflict between parents and grandparents, and grandparents-in-law, can be stressful for everyone, can contribute to relationship problems between parents,  and  can  adversely  affect  children if it leads to inconsistency between parents and grandparents in their approach to parenting. In  many  cultures,  the  extended  family  plays  a crucial part in child rearing and there are defined roles  and  responsibilities  (Crumbley  &  Little, 1997).  For  example,  in  some  cultures,  mothers often live with their partner's parents (Shwalb & Hossain,  2018),  creating  an  intergenerational household where they have to negotiate a sometimes delicate line between maternal and paternal grandparents and their expectations and approaches to parenting.

Having two income earners helps keep families out of financial hardship and  provides  opportunities  for  both  parents  to develop or maintain their own careers, to expand their social network and to have a break from the care of children. However, a major task of modern parents is to successfully manage the competing demands of work and family life (Haslam & Penman, 2018). High levels of work-family conflict can lead to diminished performance in both family and work responsibilities. Workers experiencing  high  conflict  at  home  with  children  or partners  have  poorer  work  productivity,  lower rates  of  work  satisfaction,  and  higher  rates  of absenteeism and occupational injuries than workers with low home conflict. High work stress can also  adversely  affect  family  life  and  parenting, particularly if parents return from work exhausted and  are  not  psychologically  available  to  their children. Work-related guilt can also lead to over indulgent  parenting  when  parents  overcompensate  for  spending  less  time  with  their  children than they would like or believe is normative."

Parents who maintain  good  health,  eat  well,  exercise  regularly, have sufficient sleep, and avoid abusing drugs or alcohol have more energy and resources to invest in parenting than parents with poor health or who neglect proper self-care. It is therefore a responsibility of every parent to take care of themselves and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Serious illness, injury and chronic pain can reduce a parent's psychological availability to interact with their children,  and  parents  can  experience  considerable anxiety about their child's welfare if they are unable  to  undertake  their  usual  parenting  tasks and responsibilities. Illness or injury that leads to the  death  of  a  parent  can  be  very  traumatic  for children, depriving them of their mother or father, and forcing adaptation to a new family environment. Adults who have family histories of abuse or  neglect,  or  exposure  to  dysfunctional  family situations,  tend  to  have  poorer  health  in  adulthood and are at greater risk of serious mental and physical health problems (Felitti et al., 1998)."

Numerous metaanalyses  involving  hundreds  of  studies  have shown that when parents learn positive parenting skills, their children are better adjusted (Lundahl, Risser, & Lovejoy, 2006).

These kinds of family of origin experiences can leave a parent vulnerable to experiencing more difficulties  in  raising  their  own  children  than  parents with little family of origin exposure to ACEs. The challenge for any parent is not to perpetuate the adverse effects of ACEs through their own parenting.  Parenting  programs  have  a  potentially very important role in enabling parents who have suffered  historic  abuse  to  adopt  more  positive parenting practices in raising their own children and thereby break the intergenerational transmission of vulnerability, trauma, and abuse. According to Hughes, Lowey, Quigg, and Bellis (2016) as childhood adversity has a strong cumulative relationship with adult mental well-being, comprehensive mental health strategies  need  to incorporate  interventions  to  prevent  ACEs  and moderate their adverse impacts from early in life."
