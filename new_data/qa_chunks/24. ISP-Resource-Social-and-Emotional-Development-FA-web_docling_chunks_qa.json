    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction\nIt is well known that great relationships can impact everything, from how we see our place in the world to how we interact with all that is around us. Creating and sustaining great relationships is at the heart of social and emotional development. This developmental domain influences how we know ourselves, how we develop empathy, and the value we place on those around us. As teachers and educators, it is one of our greatest privileges to work and play alongside children and participate in the growth of their social and emotional life skills. The consequence of this work is to see them thrive and flourish."

    "context_enriched_content": "The social and emotional domain\nThe social and emotional domain is essentially about how our mind and body navigate our life energy so we can stay connected with others. Our lives are full of relationships-some great, and some not so great. As such, children and young people need to learn how to understand their own thoughts and feelings and how to use them as they connect with others in social situations.\nThe very best tool we have for success is our capacity to communicate. Being a great communicator helps us manage our self-perception and how we participate within our environments (Siegel, 2012). By teaching and modelling great communication skills, we support children's development of strong social and emotional connection. How we work towards modelling strong social and emotional connection is set out below."

    "context_enriched_content": "The harmony of thinking and feeling\nWhen social and emotional development are in harmony, our thoughts and feelings are aligned. Recent research from the California Department of Education (2022) suggests that when we are feeling safe and secure, our thoughts and our feelings are more likely to work in tandem to support decision-making, processing new information or learning new tasks. This means that when we're feeling safe our brains can work at their bestwhether we're trialling an action, hypothesising about how something might work, creating or testing a new idea, or working on a current skill. When complex tasks such as remembering and repeating a pattern, or learning about taking turns with a friend in a complex play scenario, are experienced in a safe environment, the potential growth of a child's social and emotional skillset significantly increases as their brain quickly learns from and remembers the safe play. The brain is doing its thing in the best possible setting.\nOnce harmonious connections between thoughts and feelings have been firmly embedded and proven to be trusted, social and emotional learning outcomes can be life-changing (Seigel, 2012)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Empathy\nAs we build on this idea of children's harmonious thinking and feeling, some space is created to learn more about ourselves from other people's social interactions and emotional regulation. As children and young people watch others, they learn what brings the important people in their lives joy, pleasure and delight. They also learn what makes them bothered, angry or sad. For example, children and young people might laugh when a sibling or a peer makes a funny face; a child might jump or frown when another child cries, or they may even start to cry themselves.\nThe beginning of empathy is when we start to feel or react to what another person is feeling and respond appropriately to the other person's emotional state. Being able to connect with those around us emotionally helps us to build and strengthen our social bonds (de Minzi et al., 2014) and is a key element in the development of the social and emotional domain. As our bonds grow, so does our capacity to have empathy. Being able to put yourself in another person's shoes supports the growth of pro-social behaviours such as comforting, sharing, helping and showing concern for others who might be distressed.\nPerception is also an important component to developing empathy. How children and young people see themselves within a social context is significant to their capacity to be empathic. Being able to understand and consequently make sense of the feelings of others is a tricky task at the best of times, so as teachers and educators, we need to spend time talking about and modelling how to do so. This will help embed a confident perception of self and increase their capacity to   'read' a social setting. A very easy way to do this is to use a picture book, pausing throughout the story to ask children how we might be able to read cues in others. For example, if a character in a story is smiling as they jump into a river, a teacher might ask the children, or explain carefully, what the character might be feeling and what potentially brought this feeling on. Such teaching moments allow children to reflect on their own feelings and perceptions and understand that other people can experience those same feelings. By taking time to explicitly model an empathic response, teachers and educators are giving children the tools they needs to start showing empathy, and over time, they will begin to understand, experience and appreciate the difference between 'me'-focused and 'we'-focused thinking (Seigel, 2012).\nHow children and young people see themselves within a social context is significant to their capacity to be empathic."

    "context_enriched_content": "Agency\nA sense of agency is another significant part of social and emotional growth as it helps everyone to be connected and secure. The Early Years Learning Framework (Department of Education, 2022) suggests that agency has two parts. The first part is all about the ability to make choices in a child's world. The second part is that children understand the implications of their choices for their future. Let's look at a simple example of agency at work:\nCharlie and Sam are in the home corner and Sam invites Charlie to help make and share an imaginary meal with her. The two laugh and chatter, sharing ideas as they play and pretend. As this play scenario ends, they each suggest ideas for what to do next and the two friends, in agreement, move on to another game.\nIn this example we see that Charlie has chosen to share her experience with her friend, and Sam has chosen to connect with Charlie. Both children are choosing to join in the imaginary play-this is the first step in creating a sense of agency. As the play continues, both the children make helpful ongoing choices which have a positive impact on their future play, with the two continuing to build their connection. These positive, ongoing choices maintain the play relationship and in turn maintain each child's sense of agency.\nHowever, if during the play Charlie decides to stop engaging in a positive social and emotional way, this will most likely negatively impact on their future play. Sam is likely to disengage and move away because of Charlie's antisocial choice. This choice therefore has a negative impact on both the children's sense of agency, and their future relationship (Department of Education, 2022).\nAs teachers and educators, we need to ensure that when we are working alongside children, we help them to understand their agency is a two-step process. We need to explicitly use appropriate language to support and guide children's thinking as their social and emotional skills develop and grow. We need to model why making choices is so important to staying connected socially and how to make those choices in an emotionally regulated way.\nOne particularly fun way to embrace this explicit teaching is to design a social play scenario where the teacher and the children can playfully work through how to solve social problems. For example, create a fantasy scenario where anything can happen, such as saving a village from a dragon, or making magical potions to create superpowers. In these scenarios, children have an opportunity to create social environments where reciprocity in relationships are at the heart of the play. To stay in the play, the children need to listen to their friends, and respond thoughtfully, while staying emotionally regulated so the play can continue through to its natural end.\nWhen children can maintain a sense of agency through a social play setting such as this, their sense of self and connection to community strengthens. However, if they end up making choices that negatively impact or cause the play scenario to end, their sense of agency may weaken. This is an ideal time for the teacher to step in and help the child re-establish trust with their friends and re-open the pathway to future play. In doing so, teachers and educators can respectfully support children to rebuild their sense of self and place and help them to grow and strengthen their sense of agency within their community."

    "context_enriched_content": "Putting social and emotional development into action: The circle of five\nOne great strategy to help grow social and emotional life skills is known as the 'circle of five' . This strategy is all about investing in the lives of five people who you truly connect with. The investment means we are going to be sharing our thoughts and feelings with these five people, we will trust them implicitly, and we will go out of our way to make our social and emotional connections as strong as possible.\nThese five people can be anybody-a family member, a friend, or even a teacher. The number five is important as it means our connections can be meaningful and strong but not overstretched. Children, young people and adults of any age can invest in their circle of five. As teachers and educators, we can help children and young people identify the people in their lives who they trust, and how to safely share thoughts and feelings. We can also model and guide what this might look like within a healthy and safe relationship and how much positivity these relationships can bring to our lives.\nMy suggestion is that we, as teachers and educators, experience the significance of the circle of five first, so we can then authentically work alongside children and young people to help them construct great relationships with their five. When working with children in this regard, I am always very careful to include their families so they can support their child's journey and monitor its success with me.\nHere are five steps to get this strategy firmly in place:\n- Step 1: Speak with families about the significance of the circle of five for their child's social and emotional development.\n- Step 2: Share with families who might be part of this five, in a thoughtful conversation about who their child connects with. Remind families that this might change over time.\n- Step 3: Model for the child how to develop safe and secure relationships with important people by spending time with them, listening carefully, helping, comforting and sharing.\n- Step 4: Work with families to find time for connections to flourish either at the service, school or at home.\n- Step 5: Reflect with the child on these five relationships. Ask them: What makes these relationships wonderful? What do your five people truly enjoy doing and when are you doing it with them? What do your five love about you and how do you know this? Look for ways to celebrate the delight these relationships bring through play dates and collaborative experiences."

    "context_enriched_content": "3. Helping a friend\nChildren and young people are often inclined to help one another and enjoy playing group games that foster cooperation and supportive behaviour. For example, children might like to play   'Stuck in the mud' : The player who is   'in' must run around and tag as many other players as they can. When tagged, a player becomes 'stuck in the mud' and must stand still with their legs and arms apart. Non-tagged players can free stuck players by crawling through their legs. Players cannot be tagged while crawling under legs. The game ends when everyone has been tagged and are   'stuck in the mud' .\nPlaying games like   'Simon says'  or   'Red light, green light' give children and young people the opportunity to practise following directions and regulating their own behaviour while at the same time socialising and connecting with fellow players."
