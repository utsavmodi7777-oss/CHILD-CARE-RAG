Carefully consult the applicable license(s) before pursuing such effects.\nInstructors can adopt existing LibreTexts texts or Remix them to quickly build course-specific resources to meet the needs of their students.  Unlike  traditional  textbooks,  LibreTexts'  web  based  origins  allow  powerful  integration  of  advanced  features  and  new technologies to support learning.\nThe LibreTexts mission is to unite students, faculty and scholars in a cooperative effort to develop an easy-to-use online platform for the construction, customization, and dissemination of OER content to reduce the burdens of unreasonable textbook costs to our students and society. The LibreTexts project is a multi-institutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of openaccess  texts  to  improve  postsecondary  education  at  all  levels  of  higher  learning  by  developing  an  Open  Access  Resource environment. The project currently consists of 14 independently operating and interconnected libraries that are constantly being optimized by students, faculty, and outside experts to supplant conventional paper-based books. These free textbook alternatives are organized within a central environment that is both vertically (from advance to basic level) and horizontally (across different fields) integrated.\nThe LibreTexts libraries are Powered by NICE CXOne and are supported by the Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project, the UC Davis Office of the Provost, the UC Davis Library, the California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program, and Merlot. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1246120, 1525057, and 1413739.\nAny  opinions,  findings,  and  conclusions  or  recommendations  expressed  in  this  material  are  those  of  the  author(s)  and  do  not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation nor the US Department of Education.\nHave questions or comments?

Instead, this book is a compilation of created and remixed resources for use in various courses supporting the care and development of infants and toddlers. This textbook is intended to be pulled apart, remixed, reshared, and redistributed in the form that best meets your individual needs. For this reason, this resource has unique characteristics not typical of other textbooks.\n- Each chapter or section is stand-alone. No chapter references another or makes statements such as 'as you previously read.' This intentional design choice allows you to remix every section without concern about referencing a section you did not copy over.\n- The chapters were created around topics we felt should be stand-alone and therefore had different length requirements. For this reason, you will notice a chapter might be 20 pages or 2.\n- Chapters contain multiple sections to remix easily and create new and unique chapters for your individual needs.\n- You might find repeat information within sections. Since each section is intended as a stand-alone section, information might be repeated within sections to give context to the subject matter. The beauty of OER is you have permission to delete and add as needed.\n- We've made every effort to keep the original source with the content, as you remix be aware of the license types on each resource.\nTo best use a small window of time to complete this resource, we decided to forgo many of the extra 'bells and whistles' one might find in traditional textbooks. Including call-out boxes with additional resources, robust vignettes, and reflection questions. While we  feel  this  resource  contains  much  of  the  content  needed  for  multiple  infant  and  toddler  courses,  we  eagerly  await  each improvement upon this resource the infant and toddler educator community brings forth."

William  James  imagined  infants  as experiencing a 'blooming, buzzing confusion' (James, 1890). More recent and more accurate images consider infants and toddlers as young scientists making sense of their world as they actively engage with it (Gopnik, 2012; Gopnik, Meltzoff & Kuhl, 1999). The  goal  of  this  section  is  to  briefly  introduce  you  to  infants  and  toddlers  by  presenting  demographic  information,  guiding principles of infant/toddler care and education and to demonstrate why quality care and education for infants and toddlers is so important.\nFigure : Infant enjoying a caregivers playfullness (Image by Larry Crayton on Unsplash.) 1.1.1\nThis page titled 1.1: Introduction is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

More specifically, infancy refers to children between birth and one year of age, while toddlerhood refers to children between 1 and three years of age. In many texts, infants  and  toddlers  are  perceived  as  a  homogenous  group  (i.e.,  Maguire-Fong,  2014);  however,  recent  research  highlights  the importance of recognizing the individual differences between children under three years of age (Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky & Marchman, 2021; Kidd, Donnelly & Christiansen, 2018; Pérez-Edgar, Vallorani, Buss & LoBue, 2020). It is now undeniableGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>one cannot consider all infants or toddlers to be developmentally similar or to have similar experiences. There are important, early forming and long-lasting individual developmental differences (Marchman & Fernald, 2008).\nInfants and toddlers in the U.S. represent a diverse group demographically. The organization Zero to Three conducts a large annual report revealing state and national data on infants and toddlers (Keating et al., 2021). Across the years, the data have revealed a few general findings that are noteworthy when considering who infants and toddlers are and their individual differences (each year's data may be different so this list presents average findings across the years that data has been collected so far):\n- Over 50% of the nation's children under three years of age are children of color.\n- About 40% of infants and toddlers live in households where the income is less than twice the federal poverty level (about $50,000 a year for a family of four in 2018).\n- Approximately 20% of infants and toddlers live with a single parent.\n- Infants and toddlers have the highest rates of abuse and neglect of any age group.\n- Approximately 20% infants and toddlers have already been exposed to one adverse childhood experience and about 7% have experienced two or more.\n- Less than 40% of infants and toddlers are read to every day.\n- There are racial/ethnic disparities across several critical domains, such as prenatal care, preterm birth rates, breastfeeding rates and crowded housing.\n- There are disparities based on family income, such as maternal mental health, breastfeeding rates, neighborhood safety, adverse childhood experiences, book reading frequency, and developmental screenings.\n- States differ greatly in offering positive learning experiences in child care settings and in the homes of families.\nThis page titled 1.2: Who are Infants and Toddlers? is shared under a mixed 4.0 license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or  curated  by  Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "Care and Education of Infants and Toddlers\nWhat does care and education of infants and toddlers even mean? Perhaps it is most clear to start by describing what it is not. Care and education of infants and toddlers is not babysitting. Babysitting, or keeping an eye on a child and making sure they are safe, is hardly even the minimum of what this means. The first three years of a child's life are a critical foundation for later development, so  caregivers  need  to  implement  research-supported  strategies  to  create  secure  and  stimulating  experiences  with  quality relationships in the classroom.\nFigure : The fun of play Image by Antoine Hawa on Unsplash 1.3.1\nCare and education of infants and toddlers is not preschool. Although there are many different preschool pedagogical approaches, they often revolve around schedules of table top activities, circle time and indoor/outdoor play. Should this be similar for infants and toddlers? For some, infant and toddler education is just like preschoolGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>or at least the goal is for it to be as similar to preschool as possible. The activities might differ and the allotment of time devoted to activities may be different, but many infant and toddler programs attempt to be replications of preschool curricula, using a diluted approach.\nCare and education of infants and toddlers is and should be very different from preschool curriculum. The term curriculum is being used more frequently in reference to infants and toddlers, but it carries a different meaning than what is commonly considered when  people  think  about  curriculum.  What  do  you  think  about  when  you  consider  the  term  curriculum?  Do  you  envision  a curriculum book that lays out day-by-day activities with weekly and monthly themes? This is common in many preschool settings. Curriculum for infants and toddlers is different. Curriculum for children under three years of age focuses on relationships while closely observing and reflecting upon the interactions and experiences that unfold.\nThis page titled 1.3: What does Care and Education of Infants and Toddlers mean? is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "Principle #1: Children are active participants in shaping their own development.\nInfants and toddlers seek out information from their environments and social partners through eye gaze, communication/language, physical touches and manual manipulations of objects. Specific types of information attract infants' attention and provide unique access into helping them understand how the world works. For example, infants prefer to listen to infant-directed language and this type of language exposure from adults helps infants acquire language (García-Sierra, Ramírez-Esparza, Wig & Robertson, 2021; Graf  Estes  &  Hurley,  2013).  A  great  example  of  how  active  participation  shapes  personal  development  comes  from  motor development. Even after toddlers begin to walk, there is still much more improvement needed to walk efficiently. In fact, toddlers take  an  average  of  2,368  steps  each  hour  and  also  fall  an  average  of  17  times  (Adolph  et  al.,  2012).  Actively  engaging  in  the practice of walking shapes their own developmental process in walking efficiency. Additionally, actively engaging in the practice of walking is related to individual differences in language and cognitive development since walking creates new opportunities to engage with other people, holding objects while being mobile and encountering new objects and experiences (Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda & Zuckerman, 2012; Schneider & Iverson, 2021; West & Iverson, 2021).

These  relationships  are  the  starting  place  for language,  social,  emotional,  and  cognitive  development-and  these  relationships  are  literally  shaping  the  structure  of  the developing brain (Bernier, Calkins & Bell, 2016; King et al., 2021; Nelson, Zeanah & Fox, 2019).

For example, each child is raised in a cultural context that shapes all aspects of development,  but  the  child's  particular  familial  or  cultural  context  may  also  affect  the  larger  community  context  over  time  in complex ways. The same environmental factors can affect different children and families in different ways. Likewise, different environmental factors can have a similar effect on children. For example, toddlers from lower SES homes typically are exposed to less  language;  however,  this  is  not  always  the  case  as  even  amongst  all  low  SES  families,  some  toddlers  are  exposed  to  an abundance of language while others are exposed to much less (Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Figure shows how the amount of words toddlers hear in one day differs greatly amongst families. In the graph, each vertical bar represents one child's total amount of words they are exposed to in one day. So even though all these toddlers were from low SES families, there were significant differences in the amount of language from caregivers. 1.4.2 [1]\nFigure : 1.4.2\nEach bar represents one child's level of word exposure. There are total of 28 bards on this graph, for 28 different children. This graph shows the number of words that different kids heard from grownups in 1 day. The bottom section/green part of each bar shows the number of words that grownups said to that kid in 1 day. The top/blue part of each bar shows the number of words that kids overheard when grownups were talking to other people. For example, kid 2 heard 2,500 words total. 2,000 words are directed to  her,  and  500  words  are  overheard.  Child  23  hears  20,000  words  total.  2,000  words  are  directed  to  her,  18,000  words  are overheard. Child 27 hears 21,000 words total. 15,000 words are directed to her, 6,000 words are overheard.\n- . (Image adapted from Lew-Williams & Weisleder (2017). How Do Little Kids Learn Language?

Within these multiple systems and contexts, parents are children's first and most influential caregivers and their primary sources of knowledge.

For  example,  an  infant's motor ability to sit independently is related to cognitive and language development (Oudgenoeg-Paz, Volman & Leseman, 2012; Veldman  et  al.,  2019).

For  example,  achieving motor milestones earlier (sitting or walking) is related to short-term growth in language abilities (Carina, Leinweber & Ritterfeld, 2019; He, Walle & Campos, 2015). While milestone charts can provide approximates for what is considered typical development, recent research into early individual differences highlights the important role caregivers have for providing high-quality positive care and educational environments for infants and toddlers (Lopez et al., 2020; Ramírez, Lytle & Kuhl, 2020).

The  relationships  and  experiences  that  influence development from birth through age 3 can have a profound and lasting impact. For example, experiences during infancy affect the architecture of the brain or the way the brain is 'wired' (Center on the Developing Child, 2007), as well as how the brain works, including how fast it thinks, how it makes connections and remembers, how it pays attention to information, and how it forms ideas,  concepts,  and  understandings  (Fernald,  Perfors  &  Marchman,  2006;  Rose,  Feldman,  Jankowski,  &  Van  Rossem,  2008).

    "context_enriched_content": "School Readiness for Infants and Toddlers?\nUntil very recently, the majority of work in school readiness has focused on the preschool period. In fact, the term school readiness itself is controversial when applied to infants and toddlers. School readiness often brings about the idea of formal academics such as letters and numbers presented in ways that are not developmentally appropriate for infants and toddlers. However, as the term school  readiness  became  more  broadly  defined  and  the  research  base  documenting  the  important  foundations  for  later  learning established  during  the  first  three  years  expanded,  families,  programs  serving  infants  and  toddlers,  and  policymakers  have increasingly accepted that school readiness begins in infancy.\nSeveral  organizations  have  issued  guidance  and  developed  resources  for  programs,  practitioners,  and  families  on  how  to  think about and offer services to support the foundations of school readiness in infants and toddlers. For example, in 2013, the National\nAssociation  for  the  Education  of  Young  Children  (NAEYC)  published  a  book  entitled  Developmentally  Appropriate  Practice: Focus on Infants and Toddlers devoted to defining and applying the concept of developmentally appropriate practice for teachers and caregivers working in infant and toddler programs (Copple, Bredekamp, Koralek, & Charner, 2013). The Office of Head Start has also provided guidance to programs through developing the Framework for Programs Serving Infants and Toddlers and Their Families  and  The  Parent,  Family,  and  Community  Engagement  (PFCE)  Framework.  Figure presents  the  Framework  for Programs Serving Infants and Toddlers. An important aspect of the Early Head Start framework is the relationship between the provision of high-quality services and children's growth  and  development.  The  quality of early childhood service is multidimensional and encompasses not only characteristics of staff but also the quality of the interactions and relationships among staff members and the children and parents with whom they work. States have also published expectations for infants, toddlers, and their  caregivers  (National  Center  on  Child  Care  Quality  Improvement,  2019).  As  of  2019,  all  U.S.  states  have  developed  early learning development guidelines for preschool children (3 to 5 years old), and most states, although not all, have early learning development guidelines that either include or are separate for infants and toddlers. 1.5.1 [1] [2]\nFigure : Children's well-being and competence  enhance  children's growth  and  development,  enhance  parent-child relationships,  strengthen  families,  provide  children  with  individualized  services,  develop  strong  relationships  with  parents  and children,  link  children  and  families  to  community  services.  Ensure  programs  meet  high-quality  standards  that  Foster:  the proficiency  of  staff,  nurturing  environments  to  support  child,  the  engagement  of  family  strong  partnerships  in  the  community (Image from Vogel et al., (2015).

It is also true that all opportunities involve risk. A risk with applying the concept of school readiness to infants and toddlers is the temptation to funnel practices developed for preschoolers to children under three years of age. To avoid this risk, attention to the unique developmental characteristics of infants and toddlers and purposeful reflection is required to ensure activities and interactions are age-appropriate. [1]"

While  there  are  numerous  studies  documenting  the  long-term benefits of investing into the preschool years (Bai, Ladd, Muschkin & Dodge, 2020; Deming, 2009; Fisher, Barker & Blaisdell, 2020; Joo et  al.,  2020;  Knudsen,  Heckman,  Cameron  &  Shonkoff,  2006;  Nores,  Belfield,  Barnett  &  Schweinhart,  2005),  more recent studies have revealed that investing into the infant and toddler years has strong, long-lasting benefits as well.\nWhen children attend center-based or family child care programs as infants, they are more likely to graduate high school (compared to dropping out) and less likely to be in poverty as adults (Domond et al., 2020; Gertler et al., 2014; Losier et al., 2021). Attending center-based  programs,  compared to  informal  care,  such  as  by  a  family  member,  can  have  a  long-lasting,  positive  impact  on  a child's social-emotional, language and cognitive development (Davies et al., 2021; Felfe & Lalive, 2014; Gomajee et al., 2018; Hansen & Hawkes, 2009; Luijk et al., 2015; Orri et al., 2019). Infants and toddlers who attended a center-based program for at least one year saw the greatest social and emotional benefits later in childhood (Gomajee et al., 2018). During the COVID-19 pandemic, infants and toddlers who attended group care programs, compared to those in informal care, had higher cognitive abilities (Davies et al., 2021). In Chile, toddlers who attended center-based care had higher cognitive and language scores, compared to toddlers in informal care (Narea, Arriagada & Allel, 2020; Narea, Toppelberg, Irarrázaval & Xu, 2020).\nFigure : Caregiver and an infant interacting (Image by Dragon Pan on Unsplash) 1.5.2\nThe greatest returns on investments into infancy and toddlerhood may be for the children who are most at risk (Felfe & Lalive, 2014). One risk factor for optimal child development outcomes is low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is a multidimensional construct,  combining  factors  such  as  an  individual's  (or  parent's)  education,  occupation,  and  income  (McLoyd,  1998).  In  2020, there were 37.2 million people in poverty in the U.S., approximately 3.3 million more than in 2019 (United States Census Bureau, 2012). Approximately 40% of infants and toddlers live in households that are low-income or in poverty (Keating et al., 2021). In California, infants and toddlers of color are more likely to be growing up in poverty (Keating et al., 2021). Figure shows the percentage of children under three years of age in California, by race, who are living in poverty. Compared to only 7% of White children, 39.2% of American Indian/Alaska Native, 31.8% of Black and 22.2% of Hispanic children are growing up in poverty (Keating et al., 2021). 1.5.3 [3] [4]\nFigure : Percentage of infants and toddlers in California in poverty, by race.

Significant disparities in vocabulary and language processing efficiency were evident at 18 months between infants from higher and lower SES families. In fact, by 24 months, there is a six month gap between SES groups in the ability to process language (Fernald et al., 2013).  Importantly,  these  early  differences  do  not  fade GLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif> stronger  language  abilities  as  toddlers  are  related  to  stronger  language abilities  and  higher  cognitive  abilities  later  in  childhood  (Gilkerson  et  al.,  2018;  Marchman  &  Fernald,  2008).  Already  by    21 months of age, toddlers from higher SES families have greater language and memory skills (Noble et al., 2015).

Total gray matter volume is shown on the vertical axis. The blue line shows children from Low SES households; children from Mid SES households are shown in red. The green line shows children from High SES households. ( 1.5.4 [9]\nThe negative impact SES can have on childrens' development is a worldwide concern. Latin America is a region that struggles with wealth inequality. After examining young children from five Latin American countries, differences in language skills between the highest and lowest wealth groups emerged by three years of age (Schady et al., 2014). In Ecuador and Colombia, children from higher SES families score higher on language and cognitive assessments and the relationship between SES and ability only grows wider with time (Paxson & Schady, 2007; Rubio-Codina et al., 2015; Schady, 2011). By two years of age, statistically significant differences in IQ had emerged between British children of high and low SES families (Von Stumm & Plomin, 2015). A crosscountry study of children from India, Indonesia, Peru and Senegal found that differences in child-development scores emerged as early as nine months of age for children in the highest and lowest SES groups (Fernald, Kariger, Hidrobo & Gertler, 2012). A study from Bangladesh found cognitive differences between SES groups in infants by seven months of age (Hamadani et al., 2014). [6]\nThe quality of care and education in group care programs during the first three years can be an important factor to reduce the impact SES can have on children's developmental trajectory (Felfe & Lalive, 2014; Holochwost et al., 2021). Children from low SES families score lower on academic readiness and achievement, unless the children attended a formal childcare program during their first four years of life, including during infancy and toddlerhood (Geoffroy et al., 2010). Infants and toddlers from low SES families exposed to center-based child care demonstrate better reading, writing, and mathematics scores than low-SES children never exposed to center-based programs (Laurin et al., 2015). Children from low SES families who begin center-based care by five months of age have better reading and mathematical skills than infants and toddlers who do not start until eighteen months of age or later. Toddlers who were read to everyday by caregivers had higher reading and math scores as four year olds (Lombardi, Fisk & Cook, 2021). Children who were attending infant child care programs by nine months of age, had greater cognitive abilities later as three  year  olds  (Côté,  Doyle,  Petitclerc  &  Timmins,  2013).  Although  the  interaction  between  SES  and  child  development  is complex, research suggests that center-based care is related to greater developmental outcomes due to the quantity and quality of language shared between caregivers and children along with cognitively stimulating experiences (Davis et al., 2021; Lombardi, Fisk & Cook, 2021).\n'Early learning and development guidelines' from National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement is in the public domain.

The growth of personality, physical abilities and language are rapid and being able to witness the process of how development unfolds is truly remarkable. Nevertheless, the experiences children are exposed to during this time (both positive and negative) can have a direct impact on their developmental trajectories. Infants and toddlers are not a homogenous groupGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif> various  individual  differences  across  children  are essential to recognize because they can impact a child's unique developmental trajectory. Investing into the first three years can reap  long-term  outcomes.  To  best  support  optimal  development  caregivers  should  engage  in  quality  interactions  and  create stimulating environments that foster positive relationships and learning experiences.\nThis page titled 1.6: Conclusion is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

For the first few days of life, infants typically lose  about  5  percent  of  their  body  weight  as  they  eliminate  waste  and  become  accustomed  to  feeding.  This  weight  loss  is temporary,  and  is  followed  by  a  rapid  period  of  growth.  By  the  time  infants  are  4  months  old,  their  birth  weight  has  usually doubled, and by one year their weight has tripled. By age two, their weight has quadrupled. Figure shows this rapid growth in weight for females from birth through 24 months of age 2.2.1\nFigure : Length and weight percentiles for girls 0 to 24 months.

    "context_enriched_content": "Low Birth Weight\nBirth weights vary, but a birth weight too low can negatively impact the development of the child. Low birthweight (LBW) is defined as a birthweight below 2,500 grams or 5 pounds, 8 ounces regardless of gestational age. Very low birth weight (VLBW) is less  than  1,500  grams or 3 pounds, 5 ounces and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) is less than 1,000 grams or 2 pounds, 3 ounces  (World  Health  Organization,  2004)  .  LBW  is  a  critical  topic  as  the  percentage  of  children  with  a  LBW  varies  greatly between countries and between racial/ethnic groups within the same country, and is related to potential long term developmental challenges.\nIn the U.S. the percentage of infants born with a LBW was 8.31% for 2019, a non-significant increase from 2018 (8.28%) with Black (14.15%) and Hispanic/Latinx (7.55%) women more likely to have children with a LBW compared to white (6.89%) women\n(Martin et al., 2021). Globally, it is estimated that 14-20% of all births, or over 20 million newborns annually, are LBW. Figure shows national and regional estimates of the low birth weight prevalence in 2015. The specific study this data is derived from estimated the global prevalence of LBW at 14.6% (Blencowe et al, 2019). The data from this study also finds important differences between countries. An estimated 5.4% of infants are born LBW in Eastern Asia, 14% in Sub-Saharan Africa, and up to 26% in Southern Asia. Low and middle income countries account for a disproportionate number of LBW newborns, as over 95% of the world's LBW infants are born in low and middle income countries. Figure shows the percentage of change in LBW from 2000 to 2015. Worldwide and across different regions, the percentage of LBW is trending downward. For example, in Southern Asia, the percentage of LBW infants in 2000 was 32.3%, but it dropped to 26.4% in 2015. 2.2.1 2.2.2 [2]\nFigure : National and regional estimates of low birthweight prevalence, 2015.

More than 80% of neonatal deaths are in LBW newborns (Blencowe et al., 2012; Katz et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013). LBW newborns also have a higher risk of stunting in childhood, and long-term developmental and physical health challenges (Blencowe et al., 2013; Christian et al., 2013). Approximately 5-10% of all  VLBW  infants  show  major  motor  challenges,  while  25-50%  have  cognitive,  behavioral  and/or  attention  challenges. Additionally, LBW, especially ELBW, is associated with long-term cognitive, language, executive function and learning difficulties (Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2009; Barre et al., 2011; Blasco et al., 2020; Grunau, Whitfield & Davis, 2002; Marchman et al., 2019; Squarza et al., 2016; Zerbeto, Cortelo & Filho, 2015). [7] [8]\nLBW is a critical topic for infant and toddler caregivers to be aware of because the experiences LBW children have during the first three  years  can  potentially  reduce  the  severity  of  developmental  challenges.  For  example,  when  LBW  infants  experience  high levels of sensitive caregiving, they improve their executive function abilities faster and catch up to non-LBW peers in executive function  abilities  by  five  years  of  age  (Camerota  et  al.,  2015).  In  contrast,  when  LBW  infants  experience  lower  than  average sensitive caregiving, they continue to show lower executive function skills throughout the first five years. Caregiver sensitivity refers to the timing of a caregiver's response to a child and the ability to respond appropriately to the child's needs. In addition to sensitivity,  responsiveness  is  also  an  important  characteristic.  Responsive  caregiving,  or  interactions  in  which  caregivers  give appropriate responses to a child's signals, leads to stronger language abilities in LBW toddlers (Madigan et al., 2015). Language development in LBW infants is enhanced when caregivers are responsive and sensitive in their caregiving and elaborate in their communication (Loi et al., 2017; Spencer-Smith et al., 2019).

Stunted growth is characterized by a height of more than two standard deviations below the World Health Organization (WHO) age-specific growth reference standard (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2007). In simpler terms, stunted growth is when children are significantly shorter in length/height than what would be expected for their age. Children with stunted growth have a mortality rate that is three times higher than their peers (McDonald et al., 2013; Victora et al., 2021) and are at a higher risk of displaying cognitive challenges later in life (Prendergast & Humphrey, 2014; Sanou et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2021).\nIn  the  U.S.  the  prevalence  of  stunting  is  estimated  to  be  about  3.2%  (World  Health  Organization,  2021).  While  the  global prevalence has declined over the years, childhood stunting continues to be a great concern worldwide. Figure shows the global and regional change in the number of children showing stunted growth from 1990 to 2019. In 1990, 252.8 million children under five years of age exhibited stunted growth; by 2019, this number dropped to 144 million children. The prevalence of stunting differs greatly by country.

    "context_enriched_content": "Head Circumference\nHead circumference trajectories are important as they are commonly used as a measure of neurological development in infancy and early childhood. As seen in Figure and Figure , On average, head circumference increases by 2 centimeters per month during  the  first  three  months  and  1  centimeter  per  month  from  3  to  6  months  of  age.  From  six  to  twelve  months,  head circumference increases by 0.5 centimeters per month. During the first year of life, there is a 12 centimeter average increase in head circumference. After one year of age, only 1 centimeter gain occurs per 6 months in head circumference until three years of age and only 1 centimeter every year between 3 to 5 years of age. An average of five centimeters total is gained in head circumference between 1 to 5 years of age. The rate of head circumference growth during the first three years of life can vary and is influenced by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis (Regev et al., 2021; Webb et al., 2007), family  socioeconomic  status  (Bouthoorn  et  al.,  2012)  and  premature  birth  and/or  low  birth  weight  (Jaekel  et  al.,  2018).  For example, infants of mothers with higher educational levels have infants with larger head circumferences, but this difference was only found during the first six months of life (Bouthoorn et al., 2012). 2.4.1 2.4.2 [1] [2]\n[3]\nFigure : See Data Table of Infant Head Circumference-for-age Charts for all numbers represented in the chart. 2.4.1\n[4]\nFigure : See Data Table of Infant Head Circumference-for-age Charts for all numbers represented in the chart. 2.4.2\nHead  circumference  is  an  important  reflection  of  growth  and  development  of  the  brain,  especially  in  early  childhood (Bartholomeusz, Courchesne & Karns, 2002). Some studies have found smaller head circumference to be associated with a lower overall intelligence and lower cognitive abilities (Bach et al., 2020; Jaekel et al., 2019; Kirkegaard et al., 2020; Koshy et al., 2021). Large deviations from the norm in head circumference can indicate microcephaly (a baby's head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age) or macrocephaly (a baby's head is larger than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age). [5]\nMicrocephaly was in world news headlines in 2015 with the outbreak of the Zika Virus. Congenital Zika syndrome is a unique pattern of birth defects and disabilities found among fetuses and babies infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. Zika primarily spreads through infected mosquito bites and can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her fetus. A common symptom of prenatal infection is an infant with decreased brain tissue and microcephaly (Satterfield-Nash et al., 2017).

    "context_enriched_content": "Human Growth Variations\nThe growth charts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are widely used in the U.S. to describe the physical growth of children. For children in the U.S. the CDC recommends that the WHO growth charts be used to monitor growth for all children from birth up to 2 years of age and then to use the CDC charts for children two years of age and older. [1]\nDespite widespread use of the WHO charts, there are many important limitations. First of all, data participants came from single cities in only six countries (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and the USA). Second, the WHO growth charts use the growth of breastfed infants as the norm for growth, which may not represent the feeding experiences of all infants. Third, the WHO notes that any deviations from its standards should be considered as evidence of 'abnormal growth' (World Health Organization, 2006). [2]\nOne study compared the data from the WHO's Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) to data from 55 different countries to see if the growth charts from the WHO can accurately be used with children outside of the six countries the WHO studied (Natale & Rajagopalan, 2014). Results showed that many countries had physical growth outside of what the WHO considers standard, especially for head circumference. Figure shows the mean weight of two year old males across thirty countries compared to the MGRS mean score and within 0.5 standard deviations. While most of the countries fell within 0.5 standard deviations of the MGRS mean, many countries did not, suggesting that WHO's growth chart for weight may not be the best reference chart for all children. 2.5.1\nFigure : Weight at 2 years: 30 countries versus Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS). The green box delimits the area within 0.5 SD of the MGRS mean. The green line within the box shows the MGRS mean. (A) Boys; MGRS mean: 12.2 kg; SD up: 1.55 kg, down: 1.25 kg.

Interestingly,  head  circumference  was  the  growth  measurement  that  varied  the most. The majority of the countries fell outside of 0.5 standard deviations of the MGRS mean, suggesting that the WHO's growth chart for head circumference may only be an accurate reference chart for a select few countries. 2.5.2\nFigure : Head circumference at 2 years for females: 26 countries versus Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS). ( ) 2.5.2 [4]\nThe data from this study suggest that the WHO growth charts may not be appropriate for all children around the world, especially for monitoring the growth of head circumference. The study acknowledges important differences in the physical development of infants and toddlers exist across countries. Growth patterns and reference charts for children from specific countries are becoming more  available  (Bonthuis  et  al.,  2012;  Cole,  &  Mori,  2018;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  If  caregivers  monitor  the  physical  growth  of children, they should search for charts that best represent the demographics of the children they serve and not assume commonly used reference charts are accurate for all infants and toddlers."

Physical growth is often measured with charts tracking weight,  height/length  and  head  circumference,  showing  increases  in  all  three  measurements  every  month  during  the  first  three years! It is important to know that while growth charts provide standards to monitor growth, there are many limitations to these charts.  Research  has  found  significant  differences  in  the  growth  of  children's  weight,  height  and  head  circumference  across countries;  therefore,  caregivers  should  be  cautious  when  applying  growth  charts  to  all  children.  Some  children  may  fall significantly low on growth charts and are at risk of various development challenges, such as children born with a low birth weight.

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Breast Milk and Breastfeeding\nFeeding an infant breast milk is one of the best ways to start them off on the path of lifelong health. Breast milk consists of 87% water, 1% protein, 4% lipids, and 7% carbohydrate, displayed in Figure (Boquien, 2018; Martin, Ling & Blackburn, 2016). It also contains many vitamins and minerals. Another unique aspect of human milk is the high proportion of fatty acids, including the two essential fatty acids linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. These fatty acids are important for infant brain development. In addition  to  nutrients,  human  milk  includes  bioactive  substances  and  immunologic  properties  that  support  infant  health  and development (Le Doare, Holder, Bassett & Pannaraj, 2018). 3.2.1 [1] [2]\nFigure : Breast milk composition ( ) 3.2.1 [3]\nIn the initial week after pregnancy, the mother secretes colostrum, a thick yellow liquid. From days 7 to 14, the mother secretes transitional milk, a combination of colostrum and mature milk. After two weeks, the mature milk is formed and produced (Ballard & Morrow, 2013). The breast milk can be divided into the bluish-gray foremilk, present at the beginning of a feed which contains less fat, and the creamy white hindmilk secreted towards the end of a feed that is rich in fat. The composition of breast milk can differ depending on maternal health and diet, environmental exposure, and gestational age, amongst other factors (Martin, Ling & Blackburn, 2016). [4]\nBreast  milk  can  support  an  infant's  nutrient  needs  for  about  the  first  6  months  of  life,  with  the  exception  of  vitamin  D  and potentially iron. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and encourages the continuation of breast milk in combination with complementary feeding of solid foods for 2 years and beyond (World  Health  Organization,  2003).  Exclusive  breast  milk  feeding  refers  to  an  infant  consuming  only  human  milk,  and  not  in combination with infant formula and/or complementary foods or beverages (including water), except for medications or vitamin and mineral supplementation. [5] [6]\nFigure : Benefits of breastfeeding. ( ) 3.2.2 [1]\nA newborn may require breastfeeding every 1 to 3 hours for 10 to 20 minutes on average; however, the frequency and duration of breastfeeding sessions decrease as the child gets older and they can receive more milk in less time. On the third day after birth, the amount of breastmilk taken by the infant is about 300 to 400 milliliters each 24 hours, and on the fifth day 500 to 800 milliliters. Infant milk consumption averages about 800 milliliters each day during the first 6 months. [8]\nWhile breast milk is encouraged, not all families are able to provide it for their infants for various reasons. For example, a family may choose not to breastfeed, a child may be adopted, or the mother may be unable to produce a full milk supply or may be unable to pump and store milk safely due to family or workplace conditions. If human milk is unavailable, infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula (i.e., labeled 'with iron') regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety. Infant formulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and are not needed beyond 12 months. It is important to take precautions to ensure that expressed human milk and prepared infant formula are handled and stored safely. [9]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Breast Milk and Breastfeeding\nDespite the benefits of breast milk, breastfeeding rates remain low in many countries. Globally, only 37% of infants between 0 to 6 months  of  age  are  exclusively  breastfed,  with  the  highest  percentage  (47%)  among  infants  in  South-East  Asia  (World  Health Organization,  2014).  In  Malaysia,  while  94.7%  of  infants  were  breastfed  at  least  once,  only  14.5%  practiced  exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months (Fatimah et al., 2010). In Lebanon only 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during the first month of life and around 2% are breastfeeding at 6 months of age (Hamade et al., 2013). Breastfeeding, both initiation and duration, has been increasing steadily among high-income countries since the late 1970's (Lubold, 2019; Wolf, 2003); however, in some  countries,  breastfeeding  rates  have  increased  at  a  much  faster  rate  than  in  others.  For  example,  Figure shows  the proportion  of  women  who  initiated  breastfeeding  in  Ireland,  Sweden,  and  the  US  from  1984  to  2015.  While  Sweden  has consistently had higher rates, both Ireland and the U.S. have seen a positive increase in breastfeeding initiation rates over time. 3.2.3 [10] [11] [12]\nFigure : Proportion  of  women  who  initiated  breastfeeding  in  Ireland,  Sweden,  and  the  U.S.  from  1984  to  2015.  Sweden ranged from 97% in 1993 to 95.5% in 2014. US ranged from 57% in 1993 to 82.5%in 2014. Ireland ranged from 31.8% in 1984 to 58% in 2015. ( ) 3.2.3 [13]\nFigure shows the rate of any amount of breastfeeding during the first twelve months for children born in 2018 in the U.S. Younger  infants  are  more  likely  to  be  breastfed  as  approximately  80%  of  one  month  old  infants  receive  some  amount  of breastfeeding compared to under 60% at six months and under 40% at twelve months. Figure also shows the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months in 2018. While nearly 60% of infants are exclusively breastfed at one month of age, less than 30%  are  at  six  months  of  age.  Rates  of  breastfeeding  initiation  and  duration  differ  by  state.  In  California  in  2017,  90.3%  of newborns were breastfed at least once, 67.1% were still breastfeeding at six months and 43.3% were still breastfeeding at twelve months; however, only 50.1% were exclusively breastfed for the first three months and only 28.2% were exclusively breastfed for the first six months. Louisiana had the lowest percentage of infants who ever breastfed (66.2%) while Minnesota had the highest at 95.3%. At six months, the national average for infants still breastfeeding was 58.3%, which dropped to 35.3% at twelve months. Furthermore, there is a racial disparity in both the initiation and duration of breastfeeding in the U.S. (Beauregard et al., 2019). Black infants had a significantly lower rate of having ever been breastfed at 3 months (58.0%) than did white infants (72.7%); at 6 months, the rates were 44.7% among Black infants and 62.0% among white infants. 3.2.4 3.2.4 [14] [15] [16] [17]\nFigure : Rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding by age among infants born in 2018.

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Breast Milk and Breastfeeding\nThe rate of exclusive breastfeeding is lower among working mothers (Chen, Wu & Chie, 2006; Kimbro, 2006; Tan, 2011). In a survey comprising 228,000 new mothers of varying employment status in the United States, the breastfeeding rate at six months was statistically lower among mothers employed full time (26.1%), as compared with part-time (36.6%) and non-working mothers (35.0%) (Ryan, Zhou & Arensberg, 2006). Returning to work, time costs, and unconducive workplaces are common reasons for early breastfeeding cessation among working mothers (Brown et al., 2014; Ong, Yap, Li & Choo, 2005; Smith & Forrester, 2013). [19]\nChild care centers can play a crucial role in supporting breastfeeding mothers (Lundquist, McBride, Donovan & Kieffer, 2019; Marhefka et al., 2019). Lundquist et al. (2019) highlighted the importance of educating child care center staff about breastfeeding as  well  as  creating  supportive  policies  and  practices  in  childcare  centers.  Furthermore,  Marhefka  et  al.  (2019)  concluded  that breastfeeding-friendly child care centers could contribute to creating a cultural shift towards breastfeeding continuation. [20]\nWhile child care centers can play an important role, they still have much progress to make in supporting breastfeeding mothers and their  children.  For  example,  Mattar  et  al.  (2019)  showed  very  low  rates  of  breastfeeding  among  children  in  Lebanese  daycare centers.  Studies  from  the  U.S.  have  found  lower  rates  of  breastfeeding  in  center-based  programs,  compared  to  home-based programs  and  an  overall  lack  of  supportive  policies  and  practices  in  center-based  care  programs  (Dieterich,  Caplan,  Yang  & Demirci, 2020; Machado, 2015). [21]\nFigure :Breastfeeding mother ( ) 3.2.5 [22]\nStudies on breastfeeding worldwide indicate the importance of policy recommendations and support at the national and local levels (Gomez-Pomar & Blubaugh, 2018; Horton & Victoria, 2013; World Health Organization, 1998). Research in the United States and Australia  showed  that  encouragement,  written  policies,  resource/materials  distribution,  and  training  for  breastfeeding  were significantly higher in Australia, despite similar rates of availability of facilities such as places to breastfeed and refrigerators for storage in childcare facilities (Cameron et al., 2012). In Japan, there is a lack of understanding of breastfeeding in the workplace and there are perceived challenges such as the burden of breastfeeding management in childcare facilities (Yabe et al., 2021) [23]\nTo  support  breastfeeding,  child  care  centers  can  create  spaces  where  mothers  can  comfortably  breastfeed  their  children  and/or pump  breastmilk.  Additionally,  centers  can  have  a  devoted  space  and  organized  system  for  storing  pumped  breastmilk  and  a specific space for cleaning the pumping parts. All child care programs can lower a breastfeeding mother's anxiety by allowing her to feed her infant on-site, having a posted breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated, making sure procedures for storing and  handling  breast  milk  and  feeding  breastfed  infants  are  in  place,  and  making  sure  staff  members  are  well-trained  in  these procedures. Data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, a longitudinal study that followed mothers from the third trimester until  children  were  age  1  year,  found  that  breastfeeding  at  6  months  was  significantly  associated  with  support  from  child  care providers to feed expressed breast milk to infants and allow mothers to breastfeed on-site before or after work (Fein, GrummerStrawn & Raju, 2008; Fein, Mandal & Roe, 2008).

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Breast Milk and Breastfeeding\nMany mothers need to leave their babies at a child care facility to work. The longer the mother is at work, the longer the baby will spend  time  with  the  childcare  worker.  Hence,  childcare  workers  and  settings  can  be  primary  sources  of  support  for  working mothers  who  want  to  breastfeed  by  helping  to  store,  handle  and  feed  the  baby  with  breastmilk  while  the  mother  is  at  work (Cameron et al., 2012). In studies examining child care providers' support of breastfeeding, Javanparast et al. (2012) and Batan & Scanlon  (2013)  found  that  by  helping  to  feed  expressed  breastmilk  and  allowing  mothers  to  breastfeed  before  or  after  work, childcare providers helped mothers maintain breastfeeding at six months postpartum. Nevertheless, Lucas et al. (2013) found some knowledge deficit among childcare providers in the area of health benefits and proper handling of breastmilk, indicating the need for adequate support and training for them to help working mothers. [25]\nChildcare administrators are well aware of the benefits of breastmilk, but express perceived risk with the handling and feeding of breast milk (Schafer et al., 2021). This is reinforced by the fact that previous studies have also reported that the lack of literacy regarding breastfeeding and the perceived risk of handling breast milk among childcare facility administrators were barriers (Lucas et al., 2013; Marhefka et al., 2019; Schafer et al., 2021). [26]\nFigure :Bottle feeding ( ) 3.2.6 [27]\nTo support the use of breast milk in childcare centers, caregivers and staff must be knowledgeable of proper handling and storage of both breastmilk and infant formula: [28]\n- Before handling breast milk wash your hands well with soap and water.\n- Refrigerate freshly expressed breast milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days. Previously frozen and thawed breast milk should be used within 24 hours. Thawed breast milk should never be refrozen. Refrigerate prepared infant formula for up to 24 hours.\n- If preparing powdered infant formula, use a safe water source and follow instructions on the label.\n- Do not store breast milk in the door of the refrigerator or freezer. This will help protect the breast milk from temperature changes from the door opening and closing.\n- Do not use a microwave to warm breast milk or infant formula. Microwaving can destroy nutrients in breast milk and create hot spots, which can burn a baby's mouth. Warm safely by placing the sealed container of breast milk or infant formula in a bowl of warm water or under warm, running tap water.\n- Once it has been offered to the infant, use or discard leftovers quickly (within 2 hours for breast milk or 1 hour for infant formula).\n- Thoroughly wash all infant feeding items, such as bottles and nipples.\n- Consider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age, infants born prematurely, or infants with a compromised immune system.\n- Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored:\n- At room temperature (77°F or colder) for up to 4 hours.\n- In the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n- In the freezer for about 6 months is best; up to 12 months is acceptable. Although freezing keeps food safe almost indefinitely, recommended storage times are important to follow for the best quality.\n'Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025' by U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is in the public domain.

Eight foods or food groups account for most serious allergic reactions in the United States: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts (Boyce et al., 2011). [3]\nThere is no cure for food allergies. Strict avoidance of the food allergen is the only way to prevent a reaction. However, because it is not always easy or possible to avoid certain foods, staff in early care and education programs should develop plans for preventing an allergic reaction and responding to a food allergy emergency, including anaphylaxis. Early and quick recognition and treatment can prevent serious health problems or death. The symptoms and severity of allergic reactions to food can be different between individuals and can also be different for one person over time.

Infants are typically born with body stores of iron adequate for about the first 6 months  of  life,  depending  on  gestational  age,  maternal  iron  status,  and  timing  of  umbilical  cord  clamping.  By  age  6  months, however, infants require an external source of iron apart from breast milk. [1]\nA complementary food source of iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly important for infants fed breast milk because the iron content of breast milk is low and maternal iron intake during lactation does not increase its iron content. In the United States, an  estimated  77%  of  infants  fed  breast  milk  have  inadequate  iron  intake  during  the  second  half  of  infancy,  highlighting  the importance of introducing iron-rich foods starting at age 6 months. [1]\nInfants receiving most of their milk feeds as iron fortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from complementary foods beginning at 6 months of age. After age 12 months, children have a lower iron requirement, but good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain adequate iron status and prevent deficiency. [1]\nIron found in foods comes in two forms: heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron is commonly found in animal products and is more easily absorbed by the body. Sources of heme iron include: [2]\n- Red meat (for example, beef, pork, lamb, goat, or venison)\n- Seafood (for example, fatty fish)\n- Poultry (for example, chicken or turkey)\n- Eggs\nNon-heme iron can be found in plants and iron-fortified products. This type of iron is less easily absorbed by the body and will require careful planning to get enough iron for your baby. Sources of non-heme iron include: [2]\n- Iron-fortified infant cereals\n- Tofu\n- Beans and lentils\n- Dark green leafy vegetables\nPairing non-heme iron sources with foods high in vitamin C can help with iron absorption. Vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables include: [2]\n- Citrus fruits like oranges\n- Berries\n- Papaya\n- Tomatoes\n- Sweet potatoes\n- Broccoli\n- Cabbage\n- Dark green leafy vegetables\nFigure : Infant enjoying a delicious strawberry.

    "context_enriched_content": "Encourage a Variety of Food\nTo support nutrient adequacy, foster acceptance of healthy foods, and set intakes on a path toward a healthy pattern, it is important to encourage foods from all food groups. Because very young children are being exposed to new textures and flavors for the first time, it may take up  to  8  to  10  exposures  for  an  infant  to  accept  a  new  type  of  food.  Repeated  offering  of  foods  such  as  fruits  and  vegetables increases the likelihood of an infant accepting them (Nicklaus, 2016). Several studies have shown that a food is consumed more and is judged as more liked by the infant after several offerings. For example, an increase in acceptance of a new green vegetable was observed after 10 exposures (  Sullivan & Birch, 1994), and an increase in intake of a new fruit or vegetable was shown after eight exposures (Birch, Gunder, Grimm-Thomas & Laing, 1998). The effect of repeated exposure is great enough to increase the acceptance of foods which had been previously identified by the mother as being refused by her infant, which were most often green vegetables and pumpkin (Maier et al., 2007). However, despite the documented success after multiple offerings, foods are most often only presented a limited number of times (often less than five times) before the parent(s) decide that the infant dislikes this food (Carruth, Ziegler, Gordon & Barr, 2004). [1] [3]\nA nutrient-dense, diverse diet from 6 months through toddlerhood includes a variety of food sources from each food group. Protein foods, including meats, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, seeds, and soy products, are important sources of iron, zinc, protein, choline, and  long  chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids.  The  long-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids,  specifically  the  essential  omega-3  and omega-6 fatty acids supplied through seafood, nuts, seeds, and oils, influence the infant's fatty acid status and are among the key nutrients needed for the rapid brain development that occurs through the infant's first 2 years of life. Some types of fish such as salmon and trout are also natural sources of vitamin D. [4]\nFigure :A variety of colorful vegetables to enjoy. ( ) 3.4.2 [5]\nVegetables  and  fruits,  especially  those  rich  in  potassium,  vitamin  A,  and  vitamin  C,  should  be  offered  to  infants  and  toddlers starting at age 6 through toddlerhood. The vegetable subgroup of beans, peas, and lentils also provides a good source of protein and dietary fiber. [1]\nFor dairy, families can introduce yogurt and cheese, including soy-based yogurt, before 12 months. However, infants should not consume cow milk, as a beverage, or fortified soy beverage, before 12 months as a replacement for breast milk or infant formula. In the  second  year  of  life,  when  calcium  requirements  increase,  dairy  products,  including  milk,  yogurt,  cheese,  and  fortified  soy beverages and soy yogurt provide a good source of calcium. Vitamin D-fortified milk and soy beverages also provide a good source of vitamin D. For those younger than the age of 2, offer dairy products without added sugar. [1]\nGrains, including iron-fortified infant cereal, play an important role in meeting nutrient needs during this life stage. Infant cereals fortified with iron include oat, barley, multigrain, and rice cereals. Rice cereal fortified with iron is a good source of nutrients for infants, but rice cereal shouldn't be the only type of cereal given to infants. Offering young children whole grains more frequently than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as well as potassium intake during the second year of life and help young children establish healthy dietary practices.

    "context_enriched_content": "Dietary Components to Limit\nWhile encouraging intake from each food group, some dietary components should be limited. Infants and young children have virtually no room in their diet for added sugars. This is because the nutrient requirements for infants and young children are quite high  relative  to  their  size,  but  the  amount  of  complementary  foods  they  consume  is  small.  Complementary  foods  need  to  be nutrient-dense  and  not  contain  additional  calories  from  added  sugars.  In  addition,  low-  and  no-calorie  sweeteners  are  not recommended for children  younger  than  age  two.  Taste  preferences  are  being  formed  during  this  time  period,  and  infants  and young children may develop preferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods during this timeframe. [1]\nFigure :The delights of a cake all to yourself. ( ) 3.4.3 [6]\nSodium is found in a number of foods, including some salty snacks, commercial toddler foods, and processed meats. In addition to keeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers, another reason to avoid high-sodium foods is that taste preferences for salty food\nmay  be  established  early  in  life.  Choose  fresh  or  low-sodium  frozen  foods,  when  available,  and  low-sodium  canned  foods  to minimize sodium content. [1]\nInfants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked honey. Honey can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that could cause serious illness or death among infants. Infants and young children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or beverages, such as unpasteurized juices, milk, yogurt, or cheeses, as they could contain harmful bacteria. [1]\nDue to the relatively high nutrient needs of toddlers, a healthy dietary pattern has virtually no room for added sugars. Toddlers consume an average of more than 100 calories from added sugars each day, ranging from 40 to 250 calories a day (about 2.5 to 16 teaspoons). Sugar-sweetened beverages, particularly fruit drinks, contribute more than 25 percent of total added sugars intakes and sweet bakery products contribute about 15 percent. Other food category sources contribute a smaller proportion of total added sugars on their own, but the wide variety of sources, which include yogurts, ready-to-eat cereals, candy, fruits, flavored milk, milk substitutes, baby food products, and breads, points to the need to make careful choices across all foods.

    "context_enriched_content": "Infants and Beverages\nFor healthy infants with adequate intake of breast milk or infant formula, supplemental water is typically not needed in the first 6 months.  Small  amounts  (up  to  4  to  8  ounces  per  day)  of  plain,  fluoridated  drinking  water  can  be  given  to  infants  with  the introduction of complementary foods. Plain, fluoridated drinking water intake can slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and fluoride needs. [1]\nInfants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy beverages before age 12 months to replace breast milk or infant formula. Cow milk does not have the correct amount of nutrients for infants, and its higher protein and mineral content are hard for an infant's kidneys  and  digestive  system  to  process.  Plain  cow  milk  (whole  milk)  or  fortified  unsweetened  soy  beverage  can  be  offered beginning around 12 months of age to help meet calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein needs. Flavored milks for children aged 12 through 23 months should be avoided because they contain added sugars. [1]\nPlant-based milk alternatives include beverages made from plants, such as soy, oat, rice, coconut, and almond. These beverages should not be used in the first year of life to replace breast milk or infant formula. They may come in different flavors and some forms have added sugars. Unsweetened versions of these beverages may be accommodated in small amounts in the diet during the second year of life, but most have significantly less protein than cow milk and are not always fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Among plant-based milk alternatives, only fortified soy beverage is currently considered a dairy equivalent. Thus, consuming other plant-based beverages does not contribute to meeting dairy recommendations. [1]\nBefore twelve months, 100% fruit or vegetable juices should not be given to infants. In the second year of life, fruit juice is not necessary, and most fruit intake should come from eating whole fruit. If 100% fruit juice is provided, up to 4 ounces per day can fit in a healthy dietary pattern. Juices that contain added sugars should be avoided. [1]\nSugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., regular soda, juice drinks (not 100% fruit juice), sports drinks, and flavored water with sugar) should not be given to children younger than age 2. Drinks labeled as fruit drinks or fruit-flavored drinks are not the same as 100% fruit juice and contain added sugars. These beverages displace nutrient-dense beverages and foods in the diet of young children. Infants  and  toddlers  do  not  have  room  in  their  diets  for  the  additional  calories  from  added  sugars  found  in  these  beverages.  In addition,  sugar-sweetened  beverage  intake  in  infancy  and  early  childhood  may  predispose  children  to  consume  more  of  these beverages later in life. [1]\nConcerns exist  about  potential  negative  health  effects  of  caffeine  for  young  children,  and  no  safe  limits  of  caffeine  have  been established for this age group. Caffeine is a stimulant that can occur naturally in foods and beverages or as an additive. Major sources  of  caffeine  for  Americans  include  beverages  such  as  soft  drinks,  tea,  coffee,  and  sports  drinks.  Beverages  containing caffeine should be avoided for infants and toddlers.

However, no calories remain in the pattern for additional saturated fat or for added sugars. This dietary pattern requires careful choices of foods and beverages but does not require inclusion of fortified products specifically formulated for infants or toddlers to meet nutrient recommendations.

If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the 'Best Choices' listed in Figure . If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the 'Best Choices' list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. 3.6.1 [1]\nBluefish\nMonkfish\nTilefish\nBuffalofish\nRockfish\n(Atlantic Ocean)\nCarp\nSablefish\nTuna, albacore/ white tuna, canned and fresh/frozen\nChilean sea bass\nSheepshead\nPatagonian toothfish\nSnapper\nTuna, yellowfin\nGrouper\nSpanish mackerel\nWeakfish /seatrout\nHalibut\nStriped bass (ocean)\nWhite croaker/\nMahi mahi/dolphinfish\nPacific croaker\nFigure : Fish sorted by level of mercury risk.

These include the following government  programs  that  aim  to  support  a  healthy  dietary  pattern  for  infants  and  toddlers  living  in  households  with  limited incomes: [1]\n- The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) supports infant and early childhood nutrition through supplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by providing breastfeeding support and iron-fortified infant formula when breast milk is unavailable or fed only partially. WIC accommodates the transition to solid foods by providing nutrient-dense foods in the supplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers. Nutrition education and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are other important resources offered to income-eligible WIC participants.\n- The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides reimbursement for nutrient-dense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in participating child care centers, including at Head Start programs, and day care homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health screenings and families can be connected to health services to support their overall wellbeing.\n- The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest food assistance program in the United States. SNAP helps meet the nutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in low-income households by providing temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy dietary pattern. These government nutrition programs are especially important for the 14% of families with children who experience food insecurity and may struggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern. Professionals can use these, and additional Government and non-Government resources that exist within communities, to support healthy eating during infancy and toddlerhood.\n'Signs Your Child is Hungry or Full' from the CDC is in the public domain.

    "context_enriched_content": "Importance of Sleep\nAlong with food and nutrition, sleep is critical during the first three years to promote healthy development. Sleep develops rapidly during the first few years of life and is a highly dynamic process with many changes during the first three years. At birth, infants do not have an established circadian rhythm to regulate their sleep-wake cycle and therefore sleep across multiple intervals throughout the day and night in short bouts, which may also be due to infants' feeding needs (Davis, Parker & Montgomery, 2004). At about 10 to 12 weeks of age, the first signs of a circadian rhythm begin to develop, marked by an increase in sleeping through the night (Mirmiran,  Baldwin  &  Ariagno,  2003).  The  change  in  total  sleep  duration  over  24  hours  decreases  from  16  to  17  hours  in newborns, to 14 to 15 hours at 16 weeks of age, and then decreases further to 13 to 14 hours by 6 months of age (Adams, Jones, Esmail & Mitchell, 2004; Galland, Taylor, Elder & Herbison, 2012). While the need for day sleep decreases, night sleep duration increases through the first year of life, resulting in a shift towards a more nocturnal pattern of sleep (Bruni et al., 2014; Iglowstein, Jenni, Molinari & Largo, 2003; Sadeh, Mindell, Luedtke & Wiegand, 2009). [1]\nFigure : Sleeping comfortable with a trusted caregiver. ( ) 3.8.1 [2]\nConcerns that children are not getting enough sleep have been around for over one hundred years, with recommendations of ideal sleep  duration  for  children  being  provided  as  early  as  1897  (Matricciani  et  al.,  2012).  The  National  Sleep  Foundation  (NSF) recommends a daily sleep duration of 14 to 17 hours each day from birth to 3 months, 12 to 15 hours each day from 4 to 11 months, 11 to 14 hours each day for infants aged 1 to 2 years, and 10 to 13 hours each day for preschoolers aged 3 to 5 years (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). However, many infants and toddlers sleep less than the recommended amount (Matricciani et al., 2012). Figure shows sleep duration data across ages. As can be seen in the figure, the total amount of hours varies the most during infancy, followed by slightly less variability during toddlerhood. From the preschool years to later childhood, there is little variability as children's sleep duration stabilizes and the total amount of hours they sleep becomes consistent. Short sleep duration is particularly prevalent in predominantly Asian countries. A study conducted on caregivers of 29,287 children between the ages of 0 and 36 months from seventeen countries reported that total sleep duration in children from predominantly Asian countries is significantly lower than children from predominantly Caucasian countries (Mindell et al., 2010). Moreover, regardless of age group, children from predominantly Asian countries consistently sleep less. 3.8.2 [1]\nFigure : Sleep duration data across ages. Mean number of hours in for infants 0-2 yrs with significant ranging between 22-8 hrs  for  infants  0-2,  typically  the  numbers  of  hours  is  16-14  hrs,  toddler  2-5  dips  down  13-14  average  hours,  a  child  6-12  has significant variation between 6-12 hrs but the average is still around 10 hrs. ( ) 3.8.2 [3]\nSleep is important for infants and toddlers because sleep plays a significant role in memory consolidation, language acquisition and cognitive development (Tham, Schneider & Broekman, 2017). Memory consolidation is a process whereby a memory becomes more stable and resistant to being forgotten (Rasch & Born, 2013; Stickgold & Walker, 2007). For example, six and twelve month old infants who napped for at least 30 minutes after learning a set of object-action pairings from a puppet toy recalled significantly more target  actions  when  tested  after  a  24-hour  delay  compared  to  infants  in  the  no-nap  group  (Seehagen,  Konrad,  Herbert  & Schneider, 2015). This study suggests that napping during infancy can help in the consolidation of memories, like learning new actions. [4]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Importance of Sleep\nAfter learning an artificial language, 15 month old infants who napped for at least 30 minutes, compared to those who did not nap at all, were able to abstract grammatical relations among words at a later test session that occurred 4 hours after learning (Gómez, Bootzin  &  Nadel,  2006).  In  a  follow-up  study,  the  benefits  of  napping  for  language  learning  persisted  even  after  24  hours (Hupbach,  Gomez,  Bootzin  &  Nadel,  2009).  Sixteen  month  old  infants  who  napped  after  learning  sets  of  new  object-word associations  spent  more  time  looking  at  the  correct  associative  pairing  at  the  2-hour  delayed  test  session,  whereas  infants  who remained awake did not display any differences in looking between the learning and delayed test sessions (Horváth, Myers, Foster & Plunkett, 2015). These studies suggest that napping can enhance aspects of language learning. [4]\nFigure : Infant sleeping. ( ) 3.8.3 [5]\nWhile taking naps and greater overall sleep can benefit cognitive and language development, less quality sleep and less overall sleep  is  negatively  related  to  developmental  outcomes.  Greater  movements  or  activity  during  sleep  and  greater  number  of awakenings  after  sleep  onset  were  negatively  correlated  with  scores  on  the  Bayley  Scales  of  Infant  and  Toddler  Development Mental Development Index (BSID-MDI) amongst 10 month old infants (Scher, 2005). In contrast, greater sleep efficiency (i.e.\nspending a larger percentage of time asleep between sleep onset and wakefulness) was positively correlated with BSID-MDI scores in  the  same  group  of  infants.  Besides  sleep  efficiency,  longer  proportions  of  sleep  at  night  were  also  associated  with  better cognitive problem-solving skills (Gibson, Elder & Gander, 2012). Higher percentages of parent-reported night sleep (out of total sleep  duration)  at  12  and  18  months  of  age  were  significantly  associated  with  better  executive  functioning  performance  at  26 months of age, especially performance related to impulse-control tasks (Bernier, Carlson, Bordeleau & Carrier, 2010). The benefits of higher percentages of sleep duration at night extend beyond toddlerhood. Findings from a follow-up study report that 12 month old infants with higher proportions of night sleep displayed better executive functioning performance at 4 years (Bernier et al., 2013).

Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) is a term used to describe the sudden and unexpected death of an infant less than 1 year old in which the cause was not obvious before investigation. These deaths often happen during sleep or in the infant's sleep area. In the United States about  3,400  infants  die  suddenly  and  unexpectedly  each  year.  Sudden  unexpected  infant  deaths  include  sudden  infant  death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation in a sleeping environment, and other deaths from unknown causes. Figure shows the trends  in  sudden  unexpected  infant  death  (SUID)  rates  in  the  United  States  from  1990  through  2019.  The  SUID  rate  declined considerably beginning in 1990 following the release of The American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations in 1992 and the initiation of the Back to Sleep (now known as Safe to Sleep) campaign that began in 1994. Since 1999, declines have slowed and plateaued. In 2019, the SUID rate was 90.1 deaths per 100,000 live births. 3.9.1\nFigure :  Trends  in  Sudden  Unexpected  Infant  Death  by  Cause,  1990-2019.

The  guidelines  from  the  WHO  are  similar  to  those  from  various  countries,  including Australia, Canada and South Africa (Draper et al., 2020; Okely et al., 2017; Tremblay et al., 2017).

( ) 3.10.1 [2]\nUnfortunately, many young children attending childcare centers do not meet the recommended amount of minutes for physical activity (Tandon, Saelens & Christakis, 2015). Although indoor and outdoor space and budgets can be restrictive for group care programs,  there  are  strategies  caregivers  can  implement  to  support  the  physical  activity  level  of  infants  and  toddlers.  Previous studies have found that the size of the play area (Gubbels et al. 2012; Olesen, Kristensen, Korsholm & Froberg, 2013), having an indoor recreation room (Barbosa et al. 2016; Sando, 2019) and using indoor space for motor activities (Sugiyama, Okely, Masters & Moore, 2010) are positively associated with physical activity. Caregivers can create safe, open and age-appropriate spaces for mobile  infants  who  are  crawling  and  walking.  Structures  should  allow  infants  the  ability  to  safely  practice  developing  motor\nabilities without the frequent intervention of adult caregivers. Low structures can help infants to stand up and offer support while standing and walking. [3]\nIndoors, children are more active when more space is available for playing. Tables, especially adult-sized tables, are related to a reduced level of physical activity (Nordtømme 2016; Sando, 2019). The arrangement of tables and the other furniture signal to children  that  they  are  expected  to  be  seated  at  the  tables  and  that  physical  and  active  play  is  not  encouraged.  Toddlers  are significantly  more  active  when  jumping  equipment  is  present,  as  well  as  when  a  fixed  track  was  marked  on  the  playground (Gubbels, Van Kann & Jansen, 2012). Just as indoor environments have marked areas for different activities, multicolor playground markings can increase children's activity levels (Ridgers, Stratton, Fairclough & Twisk, 2007) by encouraging different physical activities.

    "context_enriched_content": "Volume Growth\nThe brain begins developing a few weeks after conception and continues developing throughout the time in the womb. Once a baby is born, the major structures of the brain are formed and ready for the many new experiences of infancy. The explosive growth and function of the brain in infancy is unparalleled by any other postnatal developmental period. After birth, the brain continues to grow at a remarkable pace with its total volume doubled in the first year, followed by another 15% increase during the second year (Knickmeyer et al., 2008). The brain quadruples in size during the preschool period, reaching approximately 90% of adult volume by age 6 (Courchesne et al. 2000; Iwasaki et al. 1997; Kennedy et al. 2002; Lenroot & Giedd 2006; Paus et al. 2001; Reiss et al. 1996). Figure shows the growth trajectory for brain volume from 0 to 18 years of age. The blue lines represent the growth for males  and  the  red  lines  represent  the  growth  for  females.  The  yellow  segment  highlights  the  significant  difference  of  growth between the two sexes. Notice how steep the trajectory rises in the first three years--representing this explosive brain growth! 4.2.1 [1] [2]\nFigure :  Brain volume growth 0 to 18 years. Male volume increases significantly and sharply from 0-3 years plateauing at 1200 CC's around 3 years of age and then increasing again from 3-6 before plateauing again at around 1500 CC. Female volume increases significantly and sharply from 0-3 years plateauing at 1000 CC's around 3 years of age and then increasing again from 36 before plateauing again at around 1200 CC. . ( ) 4.2.1 [3]\nLet's now zoom in and focus on the month-by-month brain growth during just the first two years. Figure and Figure chart the normative growth in brain volume for female and male children, respectively, between 0 to 24 months of age. Just as there are normative growth charts for infant and toddler height, weight and head circumference, Peterson et al., (2021) have published the first ever normative percentile curves for brain volume growth during childhood, with special attention towards infancy and toddlerhood. Each chart displays the 3rd, 15th, 50th, 85th, and 97th percentiles of normal brain volume growth during the first two years.  Percentile  curves  allow  a  child  to  be  compared  to  other  children  of  the  same  sex  and  age,  determining  whether  a  child measures below or above the average. In these charts for example, if a child measures at the 50th percentile, this suggests that, at any specific age, 50% of the children will have larger brain volumes and 50% will have smaller brain volumes. If a child's brain volume is in the 15th percentile, this means 15% of children have smaller brain volumes and 85% have larger brain volumes than this child. 4.2.2 4.2.3\nCompare and contrast Figure and Figure . What stands out to you? What do you notice is similar or different between the two charts? Notice the steady increase in brain volume each month, with the largest increases in the earlier months, primarily during the first twelve months. Comparing the two charts, males have a larger brain volume than females, a difference that appears early in infancy. Also, the percentile curves highlight the fact that there are early appearing individual differences in brain volume between children of the same sex, already by the first few months of life. In other words, by two months of age, some infants are at, below or above the 50th percentile. Brain volume during infancy and toddlerhood does not predict cognitive ability during these ages; however, sex and age-normalized brain volume for children between 6-18 years of age is related to cognitive performance (Peterson et al., 2021). 4.2.2 4.2.3"

These gyri and sulci form important  landmarks  that  allow  us  to  separate  the  brain  into  functional  centers.  The  most  prominent  sulcus,  known  as  the longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres: the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere. 4.3.1 [1]\nFigure : The surface of the brain. ( ) 4.3.1 [1]\nThe  two  hemispheres  are  connected  by  a  thick  band  of  neural  fibers  known  as  the corpus  callosum ,  consisting  of  about  200 million axons. The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side. [1]\nThe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain (see Figure ), which is the largest part of the brain. The forebrain  contains  the  cerebral  cortex  and  a  number  of  other  structures  that  lie  beneath  the  cortex  (subcortical  structures):  the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the limbic system. The cerebral cortex, which is the outer surface of the brain, is associated with higher-level processes such as consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory. Each cerebral hemisphere can be subdivided into four lobes, each associated with different functions. 4.3.2 [1]\nFigure : The brain and its parts can be divided into three main categories.

The frontal lobe is located in the forward part of the brain, located behind your forehead. The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning, motor control, emotion, and language. It contains the motor cortex, which is involved in planning and coordinating movement; the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-level cognitive functioning; and Broca's area, which is essential for language production. 4.4.1 [1]\nFigure : The four lobes of the brain. ( ) 4.4.1 [2]\nThe brain's parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe, and is involved in processing information from the body's senses. It contains the somatosensory cortex, which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body, such as touch, temperature, and pain. [3]\nThe temporal lobe is located on the side of the head (temporal means 'near the temples'), and is associated with hearing, memory, emotion, and some aspects of language. The auditory cortex, the main area responsible for processing auditory information, is located within the temporal lobe. Wernicke's area, important for speech comprehension, is also located here. Whereas individuals with  damage  to  Broca's  area  have  difficulty  producing  language,  those  with  damage  to  Wernicke's  area  can  produce  sensible language, but they are unable to understand it (see Figure ). 4.4.2 [1]\nFigure :Location of Broca's area and Wernicke's area in the brain.

The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain. All of our senses, with the exception of smell, are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing (Figure ). 4.5.1\nFigure :Thalamus.  The  thalamus  serves  as  the  relay  center  of  the  brain  where  most  senses  are  routed  for  processing. (Copyright; ) 4.5.1 [1]\nThe limbic system is  involved in processing both emotion and memory. Interestingly, the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system; therefore, not surprisingly, smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities cannot. The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures, but three of the most important are the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus (see Figure ).  The  hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory. The amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories. The hypothalamus regulates a number of homeostatic processes, including the regulation of body temperature, appetite, and blood pressure. The hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior. 4.5.2 [2]\nFigure : The limbic system..

    "context_enriched_content": "4.6: Cerebral Lateralization\nThe second year of life marks a period of dramatic advances in childrens' expressive and receptive language abilities. How does the developing brain support this explosive language growth? Cerebral lateralization refers to the functional specialization of the two  cerebral  hemispheres.  In  other  words,  each  hemisphere  becomes  dominant  in  primarily  processing  specific  types  of information. A common example of cerebral lateralization is language processing. Most adults predominantly process language in the left hemisphere (Lust et al., 2011; Whitehouse & Bishop, 2009); however, lateralization of language to the left hemisphere is not present at birth, but rather develops over the first three years. [1]\nAcross the first three years of life, neuroscience has discovered changes in brain activity, especially shifts in cerebral specialization, related  to  children's  language  experience.  As  Figure shows,  between  13  to  17  months  of  age,  brain  activity  is  bilateral (activated  across  both  hemispheres).  However,  just  a  few  months  later,  by  20  months  of  age,  brain  activity  is  predominantly lateralized  to  the  left  hemisphere  (Mills,  Coffey-Corina  &  Neville,  1997:  Mills  et  al.,  2004).  This  pattern  of  results  has  been supported by studies of word processing in 19 to 22-month-old simultaneous bilingual children (Conboy and Mills, 2006), in late talkers up to age 30 months (Mills et al., 2005a), and in 18 to 30-month-old children with autism spectrum disorder and typically developing controls (Kuhl et al., 2013). These data indicate that left lateralization of brain activity is not present at birth and the timing from bilateral to left lateralization is strongly related to experience with language, specifically word familiarity, rather than chronological age (Mills et al., 2005). 4.6.1 [2]\nActivation in both the left and right hemispheres of the inferior frontal cortex of 14 month old children listening to familiar and unfamiliar words.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Structure of Neurons\nThe human brain is arguably the most complex of all biological systems. The adult brain is composed of more than 100 billion neurons (Pakkenberg and Gundersen 1997). Neurons are the information processing cells in the brain (see Figure ). There are many different kinds of neurons that vary in their size and shape as well as in their function. Neurons make connections with other neurons to form the information processing networks that are responsible for all of our thoughts, sensations, feelings and actions. Since each neuron can make connections with more than 1,000 other neurons, the adult brain is estimated to have more than 60 trillion neuronal connections! 4.7.1 [1]\nFigure : Structure of a neuron. ( ) 4.7.1 [2]\nPopulations of neurons are connected to one another by fibers that extend from cell bodies of the individual neurons. There are two kinds of connecting fibers, dendrites and axons. Dendrites are arrays of short fibers that look like the branches of a tree. They extend only a short distance away from the neuron cell body. Their main function is to receive the electrochemical input signals from other neurons. Axons are long connecting fibers that extend over long distances and make connections with other neurons, often at the dendrites. Axons act a little like telephone wires in that they are responsible for sending electrochemical signals to neurons located in distant locations. Bundles of individual axons from many different neurons within one region of the brain form fiber tracts that extend to, and make connections with, groups of neurons in other regions of the brain forming the information processing networks. Axons are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin that, like insulation on a telephone wire, makes the transmission of electrochemical signals between regions efficient. Myelin is white in appearance, thus fiber pathways of the brain are often referred to as 'white matter', or 'white matter pathways'. [3]\nNeurons  communicate  with  each  other  through  'chemical  signaling,'  a  process  in  which  they  exchange  chemicals  called 'neurotransmitters. This is how it happens: an action potential is an electrical impulse that travels through a neuron, triggering it to release neurotransmitters into a small gap found in between two neurons, called a synapse. Then, the dendrites of the neuron on the other side of the synapse takes up the neurotransmitters, which then generates an action potential that travels along the axon of this second neuron. This process continues in several neurons that are connected to each other. [5]\nWhile most of the brain's 100 to 200 billion neurons are present at birth, they are not fully mature during infancy and toddlerhood. As they mature, neurons establish connections between each other. Synapses, the connections between neurons, undergo a period of transient exuberance or temporary dramatic growth. There is a proliferation of these synapses during the first two years so that by age 2, a single neuron might have thousands of connections. Figure shows neurons and their connections from an area within the frontal lobe of the cortex. Image A (on the left of Figure ) is from the brain of a one month old infant and image B is from the brain of a six year old. As we are born with most of the neurons we will ever have, the difference between these two images is not a difference in the quantity of neurons, rather the difference between them is the quantity and quality of connections. 4.7.2 4.7.2\n[6]\nFigure :Change in neuronal connections from 1 year old to 6 years old. 4.7.2\nAfter the dramatic increase in synapses, the neural pathways that are not used will be eliminated thereby making those that are used much stronger. This process of elimination is called pruning. Experience will shape which of these connections are maintained and which of these are pruned. Ultimately, about 40 percent of the early connections will be lost (Webb, Monk, and Nelson, 2001). This activity is occurring primarily in the cortex or the thin outer covering of the brain involved in voluntary activity and thinking. The prefrontal cortex, located behind our forehead, continues to grow and mature throughout childhood and experiences an additional growth spurt during adolescence. It is the last part of the brain to mature and will eventually comprise 85 percent of the brain's weight. As the prefrontal cortex matures, the child is increasingly able to regulate or control emotions, to think hypothetically, strategize, and have better judgment.  Of  course,  this  is  not  fully  accomplished  in  infancy  and  toddlerhood,  but  continues  throughout  childhood  and  into adulthood (Uytun, 2018). [7]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Myelination\nAnother significant change occurring in the central nervous system is the development of myelin, a coating of fatty tissues around the axon of the neuron. Myelin helps insulate the nerve cell and speed the rate of transmission of impulses from one cell to another. This increase enhances the building of neural pathways and improves coordination and control of movement and thought processes. During infancy, myelination progresses rapidly, with increasing numbers of axons acquiring myelin sheaths. This corresponds with the  development  of  cognitive  and  motor  skills,  including  language  comprehension,  speech  acquisition,  sensory  processing, reaching/grasping and crawling/walking. The development of myelin continues into adolescence but is most dramatic during the first several years of life. [8] [9]\nStiles & Jernigan (2010). The basics of brain development.

    "context_enriched_content": "Brain Networks\nHow does the brain retain so much information while also having the ability to quickly and efficiently process new information during infancy and toddlerhood? The adult brain is a highly organized network consisting of billions of interconnected neurons (Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Fast and efficient communication throughout the brain is necessary for nearly all cognitive processes. One theory suggests that the brain has sets of networks. Each network is composed of hubs that represent distinct brain regions, with pathways connecting these regions. Fransson et al. (2010) were the first to investigate the functional architecture of the infant brain.  They  reported  that  functional  networks  are  already  present,  even  if  in  basic  form,  in  the  newborn  brain  and  are predominantly located in the sensory and motor regions of the brain--supporting early infant sensorimotor development.\nFigure illustrates the developmental changes in brain networks between 1 month olds, 1 year olds and 2 year olds. Compare the images for each age group, what similarities and differences do you notice? In 1 month olds, the network hubs are located in the anterior (near the front) and posterior (near the back) areas of the brain with limited connections between anterior and posterior hubs. In comparison, in one year olds, the network hubs are located more toward the center of the brain with more connections linking all the hubs together. Finally, in two year olds, the locations of hubs become more spatially distributed, with hubs located across the brain and connections linking all the network hubs together. In summary, this research shows that children are born with brain networks ready to process the many sensory and motor experiences of early infancy and within the first two years, these networks experience major transformations as they continue to support the rapidly developing child. 4.8.1\n2 year olds\nFigure : Location and connections between the top ten brain network hubs.

    "context_enriched_content": "Brain Matter\nLooking at the tissue in the brain, there are regions that predominantly contain neuron cell bodies and dendrites and regions that are largely composed of just axons. These two regions are often referred to as gray matter (the  regions with many cell bodies and dendrites) or white matter (the regions with many myelinated axons). Figure demonstrates the appearance of these regions in the brain and spinal cord. The colors ascribed to these regions are what would be seen in 'fresh,' or unstained, brain tissue. Gray matter is not necessarily gray. It can be pinkish because of blood content, or even slightly tan, depending on how long the tissue has been preserved. But white matter is white because axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Lipids can appear as white ('fatty') material, much like the fat on a raw piece of chicken or beef. 4.9.1\nActually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it because next to the white matter, it is just darker-hence, gray.

    "context_enriched_content": "Supporting Brain Development\nDuring the first two years of life, the brain undergoes dramatic growth while supporting the development of various behavioral and cognitive  abilities.  As  a  caregiver,  you  cannot  directly  observe  this  brain  growth,  but  you  are  able  to  witness  the  many developmental  milestones  infants  and  toddlers  rapidly  progress  through.  Neuroscience  has  shown  that  many  developmental achievements are supported by specific underlying brain systems.\nThe type of secure attachment young children develop is related to the relationships they have with caregivers. In six month old infants, caregiver sensitivity and brain functional connectivity were related between the hippocampus and brain regions important to  emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility and social communication (Rifkin-Graboi et al., 2015). Between 6-8 months of age, infant brains are able to distinguish between the sounds of any language, but by around one year of age, they neurally commit and become more efficient at processing their native language and less proficient at distinguishing between sounds not found in their native language (Kuhl et al., 2006; Rivera-Gaxiola, Silva-Pereyra & Kuhl, 2005). At twelve months of age, the achievement of walking is correlated with functional brain connectivity of motor networks in the infant brain (Marrus et al., 2018). Joint attention, the  coordinated  focus  of  two  people  on  an  object,  emerges  over  the  first  2  years  of  life  and  supports  social-communicative functioning related to the healthy development of language, empathy, and theory of mind. The functional organization of the brain is  related  to  the  emergence  of  joint  attention  in  infants  and  toddlers  (Eggebrecht  et  al.,  2017).  The  accelerated  vocabulary development after 18 months that many children experience is related to a rapid myelination phase in language-related temporal and frontal brain regions (Pujol et al., 2006). As these studies demonstrate, not only is the brain experiencing overall growth in volume and functionality, specific brain systems are supporting childrens' evolving abilities, many of which we, as caregivers, observe in their behaviors.

Mental health disorders have a profound impact on all aspects of health, happiness and productivity. As mental health difficulties early in life have a significant impact on the future health trajectory of an individual, it  is  essential to build the foundations of good mental health during the critical period of infancy and toddlerhood (Lewis et al., 2014;  Moore  et  al.,  2017).  This  section  will  discuss  mental  health  and  adverse  childhood  experiences  during  infancy  and toddlerhood and the role of caregivers in supporting the development of optimal mental health.

    "context_enriched_content": "Mental Health\nWhile it is widely accepted that we are in the midst of a mental health crisis for young people, what is often missed is that the precursors of mental health challenges can begin as early as the perinatal period and also in early infancy (Robinson et al., 2008). This makes the infant and early childhood period a crucial window for intervention, with the goal of promoting good mental health for infants and young children (Robinson et al., 2008). [1]\nGood mental health in infancy and toddlerhood refers to healthy social and emotional development. It includes a child's ability to experience, regulate and express emotions, to develop close and secure interpersonal relationships, and to explore the environment and learn (Clinton, Feller & Williams, 2016). All of these capacities develop best within the context of a caregiving environment that includes family, community, and cultural expectations for young children (Parlakian & Seibel, 2002). [1]\nFigure : Happy hugs. ( ) 5.2.1 [2]\nResearch has established that infants and toddlers can suffer from mental health disorders that require treatment in their own right (Warner & Pottick, 2006; Zero to Three, 2012). Difficulties in infancy include regulatory disturbances such as excessive crying, sleeping or feeding difficulties and attachment difficulties (Postert et al., 2012; Zero to Three, 2016). Early childhood mental health problems  include  externalizing  behaviors  such  as  aggression  and  oppositional  defiance  (Egger  &  Angold,  2006;  Loeber  et  al., 2009), and internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression (Bayer et al., 2011; Costello, Egger & Angold, 2005; Rapee, Schniering & Hudson, 2009). [1]\nSeveral  epidemiological  studies  have  determined  the  prevalence  of  mental  health  disorders  in  infants  and  young  children, indicating a 16% to 18% prevalence of mental health disorders amongst children between 1 to 5 years of age, with approximately half of these children being severely impacted (von Klitzing, Döhnert, Kroll & Grube, 2015). One study found that almost 35% of children  between  12  to  18  months  of  age  scored  high  on  the  Problem  Scale  of  the  Brief  Infant  Toddler  Social  Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) (Horwitz et al., 2013), while another study found that by 18 months of age, 16% to 18% of children met criteria  for  one  or  more  diagnoses  of  a  mental  health  or  developmental  disorder  (Skovgaard  et  al.,  2007).  Similar  results  were reported  by  an  Australian  study,  which  found  that  by  2  years  of  age,  12%  of  children  had  clinically  significant  emotional, behavioral, or social problems in the context of caregiver-child relationship disturbance (Bayer et al., 2011). In addition to this, a different  Australian  study  found  that  by  age  five,  20%  of  the  children  studied  had  clinically  significant  behavioral  problems (Robinson et al., 2008). It is important to recognize that most recent epidemiological studies have been conducted in developed, economically stable, peaceful countries (Lyons-Ruth et al., 2017). Evidence suggests that rates of mental health difficulties may be much higher in countries where extreme poverty, war, family displacement and trauma exist (Tomlinson et al., 2014).

During this time there is an increased likelihood that detrimental experiences such as early trauma or deprivation will be especially harmful and greatly impact future development, with adverse effects potentially developing into lifelong consequences (Lyons-Ruth et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2017; Shonkoff et al., 2012). [1]\nResearchers have identified several risk factors for poor mental health in infants, taking into account the interaction between the individual  child's  genetics,  temperament  and  environment  (McLuckie  et  al.,  2019).  Risks  in  the  child  include  the  presence  of physical health difficulties, a difficult temperament, and insecure and disorganized attachment patterns (Bosquet & Egeland, 2006; Edwards et al., 2010; Miner & Clarke-Stewart, 2008; Van Zeijl et al., 2006; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017). Family based risk factors include parenting interactions that are insensitive, lack warmth, or are controlling, as well as caregiver interactions that are over involved or over protective. Other factors include overly harsh discipline, caregiver mental health difficulties or stress, parental substance  abuse,  family  violence,  limited  parental  education,  and  parental  conflict  or  separation/divorce  (Ashford  et  al.,  2008; Bayer et al., 2011; Bayer, Sanson & Hemphill, 2006; Dwyer et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2010; McCarty, Zimmerman, Digiuseppe & Christakis, 2005; Miner & Clarke-Stewart, 2008; Pike et al., 2006; Van Zeijl et al., 2006; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017).

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant & Toddler Mental Health: Protective Factors\nAttachment theory asserts that the relationship between the infant and their primary caregivers has an important influence on the development of the capacity  for  emotional  and  behavioral  regulation  (Ainsworth  et  al.,  1978;  Bowlby,  1969).  A  large  body  of evidence has identified that an infant's developing brain is shaped by the quality of the caregiving environment provided by their\nprimary caregivers (Kerns & Brumariu, 2014; Lally & Mangione, 2017). Secure primary attachment relationships, although not a guarantee against future mental health difficulties, are influential protective factors for infant and young children's mental health. A secure attachment relationship allows the infant's developing brain to develop capacities in building and maintaining relationships, emotional regulation, attention and self-control and sets a strong foundation for the later development of resilience, confidence and adaptability  (Balbernie,  2013;  Benoit,  2004).  Researchers  have  consistently  found  that  securely  attached  children  experience stronger relationships with their caregivers as well as enhanced problem solving abilities, improved peer relationships and longer lasting friendships (Abraham & Kerns, 2013; Guild et al., 2017; Schneider, Atkinson & Tardif, 2001). These children may also have  better  sibling  relationships,  more  positive  self-esteem,  an  increased  sense  of  hopefulness,  greater  trust  in  people  and relationships,  and  heightened  optimism  about  their  future  compared  to  children  with  insecure  attachment  styles.  In  contrast, insecure and disorganized attachment styles in infancy have been associated with elevated rates of emotional, social and behavioral disturbances  in  infancy,  toddlerhood,  preschool  and  beyond  (Berlin,  2008;  Fearon  et  al.,  2010;  Granot  &  Mayseless,  2001; Madigan, Atkinson, Laurin & Benoit, 2013; Sroufe, 2005; Van Ijzendoorn, Schuengel & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 1999). A 30-year prospective study of infants with insecure attachment styles at 8 months of age, found insecure attachment to be associated with a higher risk of mental health concerns later in adulthood at 30 years of age (Fan et al., 2014). Disorganized attachment in infancy is associated with the highest risk of later social and cognitive difficulties and psychopathology with an association found between disorganized  infant  attachment  and  childhood  behavior  problems  (Van  Ijzendoorn  et  al.,  1999),  externalizing  and  internalizing problems in early school years, aggression and oppositional defiant disorder (Fearon et al., 2010; Green & Goldwyn, 2002), and personality  disorder  (Steele  &  Siever,  2010).  Studies  have  found  disorganized  attachment  is  significantly  correlated  with psychopathology  in  adolescence  (Carlson  et  al.,  1998),  borderline  personality  disorder  symptoms  in  adulthood  (Carlson  et  al., 2009), dissociation (Lyons-Ruth, 2003); and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Macdonald et al., 2008). [1]\n[5]\nFigure : Caregiver holding an infant. 5.2.4\nIdeally, caregivers are able to tune into their baby's cues, interpret their meaning, and respond to them in a contingent, consistent and competent way, which has been termed sensitive parenting (Ensink et al., 2016; Petch et al., 2012). Caregivers who provide care  in  this  way  allow  their  infant  to  develop  optimal  early  social-emotional  skills,  secure  infant-caregiver  relationships  and cognitive ability (The National Health and Medical Research Council, 2017)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant & Toddler Mental Health: Prevention & Early Intervention\nResearch highlights the importance of childhood experiences across the lifespan, starting in infancy and toddlerhood, emphasizing the  importance  of  addressing  risk  factors  early  in  life  (Felitti  et  al.,  1998;  Jones,  Nurius,  Song  &  Fleming,  2018).  The  cost  of mental health disorders on individuals and society demands a response that focuses on early investment, health promotion and early intervention in an effort to positively impact future health (Jenkins et al., 2002). The World Health Organization has asserted that prevention is the only sustainable approach for reducing the health burden associated with mental health disorders (World Health Organization, 2004). It is well established that early detection, assessment and intervention of mental health problems in infancy and early childhood is more successful and cost effective than treatment when symptoms become more severe (Davis et al., 2010; Huberty, 2012; The National Health and Medical Research Council, 2017). [1]\nThis shift in focus toward the prevention of mental illness means that we must consider the mental health and wellbeing of infants, young children, and their parents (Guy, Furber, Leach & Segal, 2016). While the period of infancy and early childhood is a time when mental health difficulties can develop, it is also an enormously influential developmental stage with the potential to modify or\nprevent these same difficulties (Karevold, Røysamb, Ystrom & Mathiesen, 2009; Lewis et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2017). Since many  disorders  can  be  prevented  through  developmentally  appropriate,  high  quality  programs  and  services,  it  is  becoming increasingly acknowledged that it is not enough to merely treat mental health disorders as they emerge (Andrews & Wilkinson, 2002; Waddell et al.,  2007).  Instead,  research  suggests  that  efforts  should  focus  on  the  prevention  of  mental  health  difficulties before they arise, particularly during the earliest stages of life when there is the greatest capacity to effect change (Bayer et al., 2010; Maldonado-Duran, Lartigue & Feintuch, 2000; The National Health and Medical Research Council, 2017). [1]\nTo support optimal mental health in infants and toddlers, caregivers can:\n- Continue to learn and stay informed about the epidemiology (incidence and possible causes) of mental health in children under three years of age.\n- Establish secure relationships with infants and toddlers, with a focus on children who show early signs of an insecure attachment.\n- Engage in sensitive caregiving by tuning into a child's unique cues, interpreting their meaning, and responding to them in a contingent, consistent and competent way.\n- Create safe physical and social environments where children can practice regulating and expressing their emotions.\n- Share knowledge of positive caregiving practices and awareness of infant and toddler mental health with families.\nIzett et al., (2021).

Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs, are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0 to 17 years) such as experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect; witnessing violence in the home; and having a family member attempt or die by suicide (Felitti et al., 1998).

The  ACEs  study  found  relationships  between developmental  outcomes  and  the  number  of  early  ACEs.  As  the  number  of  ACEs  increased,  the  likelihood  of  less  optimal outcomes also increased. Anda et al. (2006) reported that individuals with the highest number of ACEs experienced nearly three times  the  number  of  comorbid  outcomes  compared  with  those  with  no  ACEs  exposure.  A  growing  body  of  research  has  since further  confirmed  that  childhood  adversity  is  associated  with  chronic  disease  and  early  death  (Brown  et  al.,  2009;  Campbell, Walker & Egede, 2016; Gilbert et al., 2015; Kalmakis & Chandler, 2015). [1] [7]\nThe Center for Youth Wellness analyzed ACEs data specific to California (Center for Youth Wellness, 2014). In California, 61.7% of  adults  have  experienced  at  least  one  ACE  and  16.7%  have  experienced  four  or  more,  very  similar  to  the  national  averages reported by the CDC. The three most common types of ACES were emotional abuse or verbal abuse (34.9%), parental separation or  divorce  (26.7%)  and  substance  abuse  by  a  household  member  (26.1%).  The  prevalence  of  ACEs  differed  by  county.  Butte county had the highest prevalence of four or more ACEs at 30.3%, while San Francisco had the lowest prevalence of four or more ACEs at only 9%. Importantly, ACEs were associated with health outcomes. Individuals with four or more ACEs were five times more likely to suffer from depression and were more likely to smoke and binge drink.\nACEs are a global concern with high rates of prevalence worldwide. Approximately 61% of women living in Mexico reported at least one ACE and 14% reported four or more (Flores-Torres et al., 2020). In Malawi, 72% of adolescents (aged 10 to 16 years) reported four or more ACEs (Kidman, Piccolo & Kohler, 2020). About 63.9 % of adults in Singapore have experienced at least one ACE (Subramaniam et al., 2020). In Canada, 61.6% reported at least one ACE and 35.6% reported at least two ACEs (Joshi et al., 2021).\nFigure : Caregiver experiencing negative emotions while holding an infant. ( ) 5.3.3 [8]\nAwareness of ACEs and their potential negative impact on the health and wellness of individuals is increasing. For example, in 2019, California appointed its first ever Surgeon General, Nadine Burke Harris. Dr. Burke Harris is a pediatrician and her research and interests include ACEs as a top concern (Harris, 2018). Nadine helped establish the ACEs Aware Initiative and corresponding website which offers free information, training and ACEs screening tools.\nFigure : Nadine Burke Harris. ( ) 5.3.4 [9]\nMost ACEs research is conducted by asking adults to reflect upon their childhood. This approach is limited because many adults are not able to remember most events that occur before the age of three (Hayne, 2004). As the first three years are so critical for establishing a strong foundation of health and development, it is important to know how prevalent ACEs are in the lives of infants and toddlers."

While most children under three years of age have not experienced any ACEs, 20% had experienced one ACE and 8% had experienced two or more ACEs (Novoa & Morrissey, 2020). Toddlers were twice as likely to experience at least one ACE (11%), compared to infants (5%). Infants and toddlers  of  color  disproportionately  experience  ACEs,  especially  multiple  ACEs.  For  example,  compared  to  only  7%  of  white children, 15% of Black children under three years of age had experienced multiple ACEs.

Their data identified three different patterns. One pattern was for infants exposed to relatively low incidences of ACEs (they called this group 'low-ACEs'). Two groups of higher ACE exposures were also identified: an 'ACEs-parent maltreatment' group who experienced moderate level of overall ACEs, mainly related to forms of maltreatment\nand  an  'ACEs-household  dysfunction'  group  with  the  highest  overall  ACE  scores  who  mainly  experienced  multiple  forms  of family and household dysfunction.

[1]\nWhile the findings of ACEs prevalence are robust, there are potential weaknesses in the tools used to collect the data. One concern is that each of the ACE risks is weighted equally. This is a concern because some risks are more likely to predict difficult outcomes than  others.  For  example,  ACEs  include  sexual  abuse  and  parental  divorce/separation.  Both  are  associated  with  less  optimal outcomes, but research suggests that sexual abuse is a more robust predictor of negative developmental outcomes. Furthermore, the stress response to an ACE may differ amongst individuals-we do not all respond in the same way to adverse events. Therefore, to truly understand the potential negative impact ACEs can have, we must understand the relationship between adversity and stress. [1]\nMcKelvey et al., (2020).

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Impacts of Adversity and Toxic Stress\nStress is a term commonly used to describe the response to the demands encountered on a daily basis throughout one's lifetime, and it  is  related  to  both  positive  experiences  and  negative  experiences.  Stressors  are  agents  that  produce  stress.  Stressors  may  be physical, emotional, environmental or theoretical, and all may equally affect the body's stress response. The stress response, also known as the 'fight or flight' response comprises the physiologic changes that occur with any encounter of stress or perceived stress  to  the  individual  (Cannon,  2013;  Selye,  1976).  This  stress  response  is  a  result  of  stimulation  of  the  sympathetic  nervous system  resulting  in  a  cascade  of  neuro-endocrine-immune  responses  that  include  an  increase  in  respirations,  heart  rate,  blood pressure, and overall oxygen consumption (Chrousos & Gold, 1992; Dusek & Benson, 2009). As Figure# shows, the sympathetic nervous system is composed of many pathways that perform a variety of functions on various organ systems. The main overall end effect of the sympathetic nervous system is to prepare the body for physical activityGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>a whole-body reaction affecting many organ systems throughout the body (McCorry, 2007). In most situations, the physiologic changes associated with the stress response are short lived, with the body returning to its baseline state when the stressor is removed. [1] [2]\nFigure : The sympathetic nervous system ( ) 5.4.1 [3]\nWhile  some  degree  of  stress  and  adversity  is  normal  and  an  essential  part  of  human  development,  exposure  to  frequent  and prolonged  adversity,  especially  in  the  absence  of  protective  factors,  can  result  in  toxic  stress.  Childhood  toxic  stress  is  severe, prolonged, or repetitive adversity with a lack of the necessary nurturance or support of a caregiver to prevent an abnormal stress response (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2014). This abnormal stress response consists of a derangement of the neuro-endocrine-immune response resulting in prolonged cortisol activation and a persistent inflammatory state, with failure of the body to normalize these changes after the stressor is removed (Johnson, Riley, Granger & Riis, 2013; Wolf, Miller & Chen, 2008). Children who experience early life toxic stress are at risk of long-term adverse health effects that may not manifest until adulthood. These adverse health effects include maladaptive coping skills, poor stress management, unhealthy lifestyles, mental illness and physical disease (Boyce et al., 2021; Garner et al., 2012; Johnson, Riley, Granger & Riis, 2013). [4] [5]\n[5]\nThere are three general types of responses to stress:\n- Positive stress response . A positive stress response is a normal stress response and is essential for the growth and development of a child. Positive stress responses are infrequent, short-lived, and mild. The child is supported through this stressful event with strong social and emotional buffers such as reassurance and parental protection. The child gains motivation and resilience from every positive stress response, and the biochemical reactions that occur with such a stressful event return to baseline (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2014). Examples include meeting new people or learning a new task."

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Impacts of Adversity and Toxic Stress\n- Tolerable stress response . Tolerable stress responses are more severe, frequent or sustained. The body responds to a greater degree compared to the positive stress response, and these biochemical responses have the potential to negatively affect brain architecture. Examples include divorce or the death of a loved one. In tolerable stress responses, once the adversity has passed, the brain and organs can recover fully if the child is protected with responsive relationships and strong social and emotional support. Therefore, an important feature of the tolerable stress response is the role of caregivers. The risks for short-term and long-term psychological impact can be reduced if children have protective relationships that support them to cope with these events (Shonkoff & Levitt, 2010). [6]\n- Toxic stress response . Toxic stress results in prolonged activation of the stress response, with a failure of the body to recover fully. It differs from a normal stress response in that there is a lack of caregiver support, reassurance, or emotional attachments. The insufficient caretaker support prevents the buffering of the stress response or the return of the body to baseline function. Examples of toxic stress include abuse, neglect, extreme poverty, violence, household dysfunction, and food scarcity. Caretakers with substance abuse or mental health conditions also predispose a child to a toxic stress response. Exposure to less severe yet chronic, ongoing daily stressors can also be toxic to children (Yates, 2007). Early life toxic stressors increase one's vulnerability to maladaptive health outcomes such as an unhealthy lifestyle, socioeconomic inequity, and poor health; however, these stressors do not solely predict or determine an adult's behavior or health (Odgers & Jaffee, 2013; Shonkoff, Boyce & McEwen, 2009).\nFranke (2014).

    "context_enriched_content": "Concept of Resilience\nResilience is the ability to properly adapt to adversity despite the conditions. It is dynamic and plays a large role in a toxic stress response. Not all individuals who experience repeated childhood adversity experience poor health, and resilience may provide a buffer.  Resilience factors are numerous and change over time in an individual. Children with resilience have been identified as having  the  following  characteristics:  higher  IQ,  easy  temperament,  a  perception  of  self-competence,  a  positive  self  concept,  a realistic sense of control of the situation, empathy, and social problem solving skills (Cadamuro et al., 2021; Cowen, Wyman & Work, 1996; Miller-Lewis et al., 2013; Zolkoski & Bullock, 2012). Factors that predict resilience in children experiencing adversity include  a  solid  relationship  between  the  child  and  parent  as  well  as  a  high  quality  relationship  between  the  child  and  teacher (Miller-Lewis  et  al.,  2013).  Additional  resilience  factors  identified  include  adequate  social  support,  parental  marriage  quality, parental  physical  and  mental  health,  and  the  parent's  sense  of  efficacy.  Focus  on  early  childhood  interventions  to  strengthen resilience factors may help to minimize a toxic stress response (Garner, 2013). [1]\nFigure : Resiliency. ( ) 5.5.1 [2]\nChildcare attendance can be a protective factor against early ACEs. For infants and toddlers who experience adverse experiences, being cared for by their parents is associated with lower cognitive abilities, but attending childcare during the first three years was associated with higher cognitive abilities (Larose et al., 2020). To promote resilience in all infants and toddlers, and especially those who have experienced ACEs, caregivers can:\n- Create secure attachments that provide children with a sense of dependency and safety. Children with a stronger connection to their caregiver are more likely to have greater self-regulation skillsGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>a key component of resilience (Bethell et al., 2022).\n- Implement program policies purported by the Program for Infant and Toddler Care (PITC) such as primary care, individualized care and continuity of care.\n- Respond to infants' and toddlers' social and emotional needs in a respectful and sensitive way.\n- Help infants and toddlers to learn how to regulate their own emotions in a positive and secure way. Research has revealed that when caregivers help children to regulate their own emotions, it promotes resilience in the children (Humphreys, King, GuyonHarris & Zeanah, 2021).\n- Label emotions and openly discuss them with children.\n- Provide safe opportunities for children to take risks such as engaging with new people and physical challenges with climbing equipment.\nFranke (2014).

    "context_enriched_content": "Trauma and Care\nToxic stresses in general are strongly linked to poor health outcomes across the lifespan and trauma-informed care is one approach to  caregiving  based  on  the  recognition  of  this  relationship.  Caregivers  of  trauma-informed  care  strive  to  understand  children's behavior in light of previous traumas they have experienced, such as ACEs. Thus, trauma-informed care for infants and toddlers begins  with  first  recognizing  the  prevalence  and  potential  impact  toxic  stress  and  ACEs  can  have  during  the  first  three  years. Caregivers also provide supportive care that enhances children's feelings of safety and security, to prevent their re-traumatization in a current situation that may potentially overwhelm their coping skills. [1]\n[1]\nSeveral key concepts of trauma-informed care applied to infants and toddlers include:\n- realizing the impact that trauma can have on infants and toddlers, and that reactions to a past trauma may inform the child's current response to a potentially traumatic situation;\n- recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma in infants and toddlers and the staff caring for them; and\n- resisting re-traumatization, to prevent a situation that represents a tolerable stress from evolving into a toxic stress (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014).\nAdopting a trauma-informed approach is not accomplished through any single particular technique or checklist. It requires constant attention,  caring  awareness,  sensitivity,  and  possibly  a  cultural  change  at  an  organizational  level.  A  trauma-informed  approach reflects adherence to six key principles rather than a prescribed set of practices or procedures. The six key principles fundamental to a trauma-informed approach include: [3] [4]\n1. Safety . Children feel physically and psychologically safe. The physical setting is safe and the interpersonal interactions infants and toddlers have with caregivers promote a sense of safety. This principle supports the belief from experts that positive relationships are at the heart of infant and toddler care and education (Lally & Mangione, 2017) and the critical importance of program policies such as primary caregiving, continuity of care and small groups in establishing and fostering such positive and secure relationships (De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven & Geurts, 2006; McMullen, 2018; Ogren & Johnson, 2021).\n2. Trustworthiness and transparency . Organizational operations and classroom practices are conducted with transparency and the goal of building and maintaining trust with children, families, among staff and others involved in the organization. This principle emphasizes open communication between a childcare program and enrolled families about foundational policies and practices as well as everyday routines and daily child updates.\n3. Peer support . The term 'peers' refers to individuals with lived experiences of trauma, or in the case of infants and toddlers, this can be family members of children who have experienced traumatic events. Peer support is a key vehicle for establishing safety and hope, building trust, enhancing collaboration and utilizing their stories and lived experiences to promote recovery and healing. This principle can mean a child care program explicitly creates a culture of respect and support and invites families of enrolled children and community members, especially those with lived experiences of trauma, into an open dialogue about how best to support children and families who have experienced trauma.\n4. Collaboration and mutuality . Importance is placed on partnering because healing happens in relationships and in the meaningful sharing of power and decision-making. The organization recognizes that everyone has a role to play in a traumainformed approach. For a child care program to become more trauma-informed may mean reaching out to other organizations or individuals for information, assistance and resources. National organizations such as the National Association for the Education\nof Young Children (NAEYC) and Zero to Three both have information and resources about trauma-informed care, but local organizations can be a great resource as well."

Throughout the organization and the families served, children's strengths and experiences are recognized and built upon. The organization fosters a belief in resilience and in the ability of caregivers and communities to heal and promote recovery from trauma. Child care programs can provide training specially on infant and toddler mental health and trauma-informed care, emphasizing the significant role of relationships between caregivers and children. Staff are empowered to do their work as well as possible with adequate organizational supportGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>staff need to feel safe as well. Recognition of caregivers' personal trauma and its potential impact on children is also necessary. One study found that 73% of early childhood educators had experienced at least one ACE, 22% had experienced four or more ACEs and educators who reported higher numbers of ACEs contributed to lower social and emotional climate scores in classrooms (Hubel et al., 2020).\n6. Cultural, historical and gender issues . The organization actively moves past cultural stereotypes and biases (e.g., based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, religion, gender-identity, etc.,); incorporates policies, protocols and processes that are responsive to the racial, ethnic and cultural needs of the children and families and recognizes and addresses historical trauma. This principle requires child care programs to actively take steps to recognize the prevalence of trauma and its role in providing trauma-informed care to infants and toddlers and their families, as well as employed caregivers and staff. Institutional policies and protocols need to be established and supported, as well as everyday practices and processes between children, caregivers and families.\n3. Sanders & Hall (2018).

Therefore,  it  is  critical  that  caregivers  are  knowledgeable  of  the  research,  risks  and  preventative strategies to best support the mental health of infants and toddlers. To address the mental health of infants and toddlers, traumainformed care recognizes the prevalence and potential impact of trauma and offers principles that child care programs can strive toward implementing.

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Motor Development\nMotor  development  may  not  initially  seem  like  the  most  interesting  topic,  especially  compared  to  language  and  cognitive development.  In  fact,  motor  development  has  been  considered  the  'Cinderella  of  developmental  science',  central  to  children's experiences, but rarely in the spotlight (Adolph et al., 2010; Rosenbaum, 2005). Historically, a maturational approach to motor skills  was  predominant  in  the  early  twentieth  century,  which  mainly  argued  that  motor  development  unfolds  via  predetermined biological changes, with little to no influence from environmental or cognitive domains (Gesell & Amatruda, 1945). Isolation of motor skills resulted in very little research focusing on the role of motor skills on other domains of development. However, recent research is embracing the possibility of cross domain interactions resulting in cascading developmental changes (Gibson, 1988; Masten & Cicchetti, 2010; Spencer et al., 2011; Thelen & Smith, 2006). Furthermore, motor development is about more than just milestones-because motor development can be easily observed by caregivers, it reveals the inner workings of an infant's mind and introduces the child to new experiences that enrich cognitive and language growth.

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant Reflexes\nBefore infants produce self-initiated movements, they exhibit inborn reflexes. Infants are born with a number of reflexes which are involuntary movements in response to stimulation controlled by the brain stem. These include the sucking reflex (infants suck on objects that touch their lips automatically), the rooting reflex (which involves turning toward any object that touches the cheek), the palmar grasp demonstrated in Figure (the  infant  will  tightly  grasp  any  object  placed  in  its  palm),  and  the  dancing  reflex (evident when the infant is held in a standing position and moves its feet up and down alternately as if dancing). These movements occur automatically and are signals that the infant is functioning well neurologically. 6.2.1 [1]\nFigure : The palmer grasp reflex in an infant. ( ) 6.2.1 [2]\nOver the first few months of life these reflexes are replaced with voluntary movements. For example, the grasping reflex develops by 28 weeks gestation and disappears by six months of age (Schott & Rossor, 2003; Zafeiriou, 2004). The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex is performed by manual rotation of the infant's head to one side. The infant will extend its arm to the side of the rotated face and flex the contralateral arm (see Figure# for a picture of this reflex). The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex develops by 35 weeks gestation and disappears by three months of age (Zafeiriou, 2004). These inborn reflexes fade within predictable timeframes and can be a sign of concern if they remain longer (Futagi, Toribe & Suzuki, 2012). Children with reflexes that persist for longer than expected, show lower motor abilities, learning difficulties in school and are linked to attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms (Bilbilaj, Gjipali & Shkurti, 2017; Konicarova, Bob & Raboch, 2013; Pecuch et al., 2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Peripersonal Space\nThroughout the first few months, infants move their limbs frequently (driven initially by reflexes and later by self-initiation) and as they do, they come into contact with their body and various objects and people around them. While these early movements may not seem important, they are actually a way for infants to begin to learn about themselves and the world around them.\nDeveloping a sense of our body is an essential prerequisite for our interactions with the world. Sensing our body entails knowing where our limbs are in space and time, being aware of how fast or how far our limbs can move, or even knowing how much space our body occupies in our environment. Peripersonal space is defined as the space surrounding the body where we can reach or be reached  by  external  entities,  including  objects  or  other  individuals.  Knowing  the  limits  and  extent  of  our  peripersonal  space  is fundamental for navigating our social and physical world, and for situating and orienting ourselves in everyday activities. [1] [2]\nFigure : An infant exploring peripersonal space. ( ) 6.3.1 [3]\nWith every touch of their body and surrounding areas, infants are receiving feedback that informs them about their posture, any changes in limb position and about contact with themselves or other surfaces, thereby allowing them to discover knowledge of not only their limbs and their range of motion, but also an understanding of their peripersonal space. These self-generated movements, as  infants  move  their  limbs  freely,  provide  a  foundation  for  exploratory  behavior  and  build  a  basic  understanding  of  body representation and of the world (Hoffmann, 2017). Touches to the body in particular provide information about the limb posture in space, the part of the limb making contact with the body, and the body area being touched (Rochat & Hespos, 1997). [1]\nResearch that has studied young infants exploring peripersonal space through touch have found that infants produce nearly 200 contacts on their bodies and the surrounding surface area in a 10 minute time period and touch as many as 18 different areas, mainly their upper body and the floor (DiMercurio, Connell, Clark & Corbetta, 2018). Infants also spent about 50% of that time moving their arms in the air, going from one place of contact to another. Figure maps the frequency of touches to various areas of the body and surrounding surface area from one infant. The blue dots are contacts performed by the infant's right hand, the red dots are contacts performed by the infant's left hand. Such touching is fundamental for developing an early sense of the body and for discovering the boundaries of the peripersonal space in which future developing goal-directed actions will take place. In fact, other research has found that greater arm movement in early infancy is related to larger increases in language and cognitive abilities (Shida-Tokeshi et al., 2018). Together, this research suggests that infants are active explorers of their peripersonal space and that these early self-generated sensorimotor experiences form the critical foundation from which future motor behaviors and knowledge of the world develop. 6.3.2 [1]\nFigure : Frequency of touches by area for one infant. ( ) 6.3.2 [4]\nTo  support  the  exploration  of  peripersonal  space,  infants  need  time  and  space  to  freely  move  and  explore  with  their  limbs. Caregivers can ensure that infants have ample time lying comfortably on their backs on floors to support limb movement. Young infants also need space without the consistent overcrowding of play objects or frequently being placed in an activity gym device. Additionally,  infant  swings,  car  seats  and  many  other  devices  limit  limb  movement  and  therefore  restrict  exploration  of peripersonal  space.  To  freely  move  their  limbs,  infants  need  clothes  that  allow  for  full-range  reaching  (compared  to  clothes  or swaddles that  reduce  limb  movement).  Realizing  how  important  it  is  for  infants  to  explore  their  peripersonal  space,  caregivers should be cognizant of the significance of providing the time and space for infants to move their limbs as they learn about their bodies and the surrounding surface areas.\nDiMercurio et al., (2018).

    "context_enriched_content": "Emmi Pikler and Magda Gerber\nThe  research  on  the  importance  of  peripersonal  space  supports  some  of  the  methods  Emmi  Pikler  and  Magda  Gerber  touted; however, their influence on the field of early childhood education goes much further and continues to inform current practices in infant and toddler care and development, especially motor development.\nPikler  was  born  in  1902  and  spent  her  early  childhood  in  Vienna.  She  obtained  her  medical  degree  in  1927  and  became  a pediatrician. Later she founded the Pikler Institute in Budapest in 1946, which she headed until 1979. Pikler believed that infants should be put on their backs until they can themselves move into different positions. By being on their back, she argued infants learn  about  their  bodies  and  how  to  move  their  bodies  as  they  reach,  bend  and  touch  while  playing  with  various  movements (Gonzalez-Mena, 2014). Importantly, an infant's movements are driven by their own internal motivation to move. Pikler advised caregivers to not place infants on their stomachs until they move themselves into that position (Tardos, 2010). Her observations and years of work with children informed her belief in allowing children the freedom of self-initiated movement. [1]\nAlthough Pikler's work provides various principles to learn from (Chahin & Tardos, 2017; Gonzalez-Mena, Chahin & Briley, 2005; Tardos, 2010) here are four core principles: [2]\n- Deep respect for the child and their individuality, recognizing them as an individual with rights rather than as an object.\n- Promotion of the child's autonomous activity, based on their own initiatives.\n- The importance of the bond between the adult caregiver and the child, based on a respectful and affective relationship in quality moments of care.\n- Respect for the child's freedom of movement, for playing and exploring their peripersonal space and surroundings.\nFigure : Emmi Pikler. ( ) 6.4.1 [3]\nMagda Gerber was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1910. Inspired by Pikler, Gerber earned a Master's degree in early childhood education in Budapest and in 1945 she began working with Pikler at the Pikler Institute. Overtime, Pikler became Gerber's mentor and friend. In 1978, Gerber and Thomas Forrest co-founded the non-profit organization Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) in Los Angeles to further their work with families and child care professionals. At RIE, Gerber taught caregivers to observe infants and toddlers as they played, while a facilitator modeled how and when to intervene. [4]\n[4]\nThe basic principles of the RIE approach are (Gerber & Johnson, 1998):\n- Basic trust in the child to be an initiator, an explorer, and a self-learner.\n- An environment for the child that is physically safe, cognitively challenging and emotionally nurturing.\n- Time for uninterrupted play.\n- Freedom to explore and interact with other infants.\n- Involvement of the child in all care-giving activities to allow the child to be an active participant rather than a passive recipient.\n- Sensitive observation of the child in order to understand her needs.\n- Consistency and clearly defined limits and expectations to develop discipline.\nRIE's  mission  is  to  improve  the  lives  of  infants  and  young  children  through  respectful  care.  Gerber  believed  that  infants  and toddlers  are  whole,  competent  beings  from  birth  and  should  be  treated  as  such.  Gerber  wrote  \"We  not  only  respect  babies,  we demonstrate our respect every time we interact with them. Respecting a child means treating even the youngest infant as a unique human being, not as an object\" (Gerber, 2002). [4]\nAs you reflect on the ideas and principles from Pikler and Gerber, consider these questions:\n- Do you agree or disagree with their ideas and principles?\n- How do their ideas and principles challenge common advice and caregiving practices about supporting infant and toddler motor development?\n- In your experience working with infants and toddlers, have you seen their ideas and principles implemented?\n- What does respecting an infant and toddler look like?\n- What are the benefits and challenges caregivers and group care programs could experience when implementing their ideas and principles?\n[1]\n'Emmi Pikler' on Wikipedia is licensed under CC by SA 4.0"

    "context_enriched_content": "Trends\nThe physical bodies of infants and toddlers show common growth trends and these trends relate to motor development. There are two  important  trends:  cephalocaudal  and  proximodistal.  The  cephalocaudal  trend  acknowledges  a  top-down  growth  trend.  For example, infants may use their upper limbs before their lower limbs. The proximodistal trend, on the other hand, acknowledges growth from the center of the body outwards. For example, infants use their arms before they can use their fingers effectively.\nFigure : Infant using both feet to interact with a book. . ( ) 6.5.1 [1]\nResources on infant and toddler development sometimes mistakenly reference cephalocaudal and proximodistal trends as principles (i.e.,  Gonzalez-Mena, 2014). The reason they are trends and not principles is that they only describe what typically happens (a trend) as not all infants show motor development that exactly follows these trends. For example, research has shown that some infants will reach for and interact with objects using their feet before they are able to do so with their hands (Galloway & Thelen, 2004; Heathcock & Galloway, 2009), which does not follow the cephalocaudal trend.

    "context_enriched_content": "Motor Milestones\nInfants and toddlers are constantly learning about the world as they experience it and actively engage with it during the first three years of life. Milestones represent what most children (75% or more) can do by specific ages. This chart represents the new and improved  milestone  charts  provided  by  the  CDC  in  2022  with  substantial  evidence-based  updates.  These  milestone  charts  are meant to prompt surveillance and conversation and, if needed, identification and early intervention. The CDC adopts a proactive stance-we should take action early when developmental concerns arise rather than the perspective of waiting to see if a child 'catches up'. While children do develop at individual paces, being proactive during these critical early years is essential (Morgan et al., 2021; Noritz et al., 2013). The chart below lists milestones that, if children are not achieving by specific ages, caregivers should  encourage  parents  to  communicate  with  their  family's  pediatrician.  Most  caregivers  are  not  professionally  trained  to officially assess the developmental abilities of children; however, caregivers have the ability to track developmental progress and are often the first to notice developmental concerns. Here is a table of some of the motor milestones for infants and toddlers.\n2 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Hold their head up when on their tummy. ● Move both arms and both legs. ● Open hands briefly.. 4 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Hold their head steady without support while being held. ● Hold a toy when placed in their hand. ● Use their arms to swing at toys. ● Bring their hands to their mouth. ● Push up onto their elbows/forearms when on their tummy.\n6 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Roll from tummy to back. ● Push up with straight arms when on their tummy. ● Lean on their hands for support when sitting.. 9 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Stand while holding on for support. ● Can get into a sitting position. ● Sit without support. ● Pull up into a standing position. ● Crawl.. 12 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Pull up to stand. ● Walk, holding on to furniture. ● Drink from a cup without a lid, as you hold it. ● Pick things up between thumb and pointer finger, like small bits of food.. 15 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Take a few steps independently. ● Use fingers to feed themselves some food.. 18 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Walk without holding on to anyone or anything. ● Scribble. ● Drink from a cup without a lid and may spill sometimes. ● Feed themselves with their fingers. ● Try to use a spoon. ● Climb on and off a couch or chair without help.. 24 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Kick a ball. ● Run. ● Walk (not climb) up a few stairs with or without help. ● Eat with a spoon.. 30 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● Use their hands to twist things, like turning door knobs or unscrewing lids. ● Take some clothes off independently, like loose pants or an open jacket. ● Jump off the ground with both feet. ● Turn book pages, one at a time, when you read with them.. 36 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [3] = ● String items together, like large beads or macaroni. ● Put on some clothes independently, like loose pants or a jacket. ● Use a fork."

Figure 6.6.2 is based on research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, & de Onis, 2006). It presents windows of achievement for six gross motor development milestones based on infants and toddlers from five countries: Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and the USA. The six milestones in the chart are sitting without support, standing with assistance, hand and knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone.\nFigure :  Windows of achievement for six gross motor milestones. The chart is based on research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, & de Onis, 2006). It presents windows of achievement for six gross motor development milestones based on infants and toddlers from five countries: Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and the USA. The six milestones in the chart are sitting without support, standing with assistance, hand and knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone. ( ) 6.6.2 [4]\nBased on the research, there are a few findings worth noting:\n- In general, there is a common order in achieving these milestones. First children are able to sit without support, then achieve standing with assistance, followed by walking with assistance which then leads to standing alone and lastly walking alone.\n- The one milestone that did not always follow the general order was hand-and-knees crawling. Sometimes children would crawl on their hands and knees before being able to stand with assistance.\n- 4.3% of infants did not exhibit hand-and-knees crawling at all-they skipped this milestone and went straight into walking.\n- The windows of achievement overlap-Figure clearly depicts this. The start of each window of achievement for every milestone does not begin near the end of the previous milestone window, but rather begins near the beginning of the previous milestone window. This overlap acknowledges the wide age variability of infants and toddlers achieving these milestones. 6.6.2\n- The length of each milestone window varies across the motor skills. Walking alone and standing alone have the longest achievement window, suggesting that these two abilities have the most variability in age of achievement. For example, some children began walking alone around eight months of age, while others did not achieve this milestone until after seventeen months of age. On the other hand, sitting without support and standing with assistance showed the two most narrow windows of achievement, suggesting that these two abilities have the least variability in age of achievement."

    "context_enriched_content": "Motor Milestone Chart Limitations\nGross  motor  milestone  charts,  while  important,  do  not  capture  the  complex  developments  that  lead  up  to  achieving  specific milestones.  Take  for  example  the  process  to  be  able  to  sit  independently.  The  ability  to  maintain  balance  in  the  sitting  posture gradually emerges between 2 and 9 months of age (Butler et al., 2010). When infants are 5 to 6 months old, they are able to 'prop sit' or sit independently for short periods (Shumway-Cook & Woollacott, 2003). At 6 months, hip joint mobility increases, allowing the thighs to rest on the contact surface and the infant is able to sit with their legs in a ring position (Bly, 1994), i.e., symmetrically flexed, abducted with externally rotated hips and flexed knees. Between 8 to 9 months, the trunk and pelvis muscles stabilize the\nsitting  position,  allowing  the  infant  to  narrow  the  support  base  for  balanced  independent  sitting  (Harbourne,  Lobo,  Karst  & Galloway, 2013; van der Fits et al.,  1999).  After  being  able  to  sit  independently,  infants  learn  to  perform  a  coordinated  action between upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs as they are able to use their lower body to balance as they reach with their upper limbs (Rochat & Goubet, 1995). Thus, unlike milestone charts that simply show sitting to occur, sitting without support is a process that takes place over many months and involves a complex interplay between various muscles that prepare for the eventual achievement of sitting. [5]\nFigure : Infant in a sitting posture. ( ) 6.6.3 [6]\nAnother limitation of motor milestones is that they convey the idea that once an infant performs a motor milestone, like walking, that the infant has fully achieved this milestone. The reality is that motor development involves numerous bouts of successes and failures with each milestone ability. An infant that successfully walks once, may fall the very next attempt. Karen Adolph and her colleagues (2012) have documented the number of steps and falls toddlers have as they learn to walk. Toddlers between 12 to 18 months of age take an average of 2,368 steps in just one hour and cover a distance of 701 meters-the length of almost eight football fields! This is just one hour; multiplying these numbers by the total number of hours toddlers are awake is even more eyeopening. In six hours, a toddler could accumulate around 14,000 total steps and cover the distance of 46 football fields! Despite these infants clearly being able to walk, they also continue to fall. In fact, the average toddler fell seventeen times each hour, one toddler even fell sixty-nine times in one hour.\nFigure : A caregiver supporting an infant learning to walk ( ) 6.6.4 [7]\nEvery  day,  infants  are  practicing  various  motor  skills  and  body  positions.  For  example,  Figure provides  insight  into  the various  motor  behaviors  and  body  positions  from  one  10  month  old  infant.  While  the  majority  of  time  was  spent  in  a  seated position (40.5%), the infant was consistently practicing various other positions, frequently rotating between them. 6.6.5\nFigure : Frequency of body positions during one day from one 10-month-old infant.

    "context_enriched_content": "Gross Motor Development\nIn the process of gross motor development, the first mobility that infants usually acquire is crawling. There are different types of infant crawling (see Figure for  a  depiction) such as belly crawling and hands-and-knees crawling (Patrick, Noah & Yang, 2012). Belly crawling is the action in which infants move by pulling the body along the ground on the abdomen. Hands-and-knees crawling  means  moving  by  lifting  the  abdomen  up  on  both  arms  and  knees.  Some  infants  experience  both  belly  crawling  and hands-and-knees  crawling,  others  experience  only  hands-and-knees  crawling  (Kalmar,  2017).  Previous  studies  have  explored  a relationship between belly crawling and hands-and-knees crawling: infants who formerly belly-crawled showed more proficient hands-and-knees  crawling  than  those  who  skipped  the  belly  crawling  period  (Adolph,  Vereijken  &  Denny,  1998).  Infants  who spend a greater amount of awake time in the prone position (abdomen on ground, such as during tummy time) achieve hands-andknees crawling at an earlier age (  Davis, Moon, Sachs & Ottolini, 1998). 6.6.6 [9]\nFigure : Examples of various infant crawling styles: (A) Hands-and-knees crawling.

    "context_enriched_content": "Tummy Time.\nTummy time describes the times when a caregiver places an infant on their stomach while the infant is awake and someone is watching. Tummy time is not only an important way to prevent flat spots on a baby's head, it is also an important part of a baby's normal growth. In fact, tummy time is positively related to overall gross motor development (Buchanan et al., 2021; Carson et al., 2022; Hewitt et al., 2020). Tummy time is especially important for infants who are at risk of motor delays and/or who have a motor-related  disability  (Uzark  et  al.,  2021;  Wentz,  2017).  While  tummy  time  is  supported  by  many  professionals  and  wellrespected organizations, there are arguments against the necessity of the practice (see Gerber & Johnson, 1998). [1]\nFigure :Infant practicing tummy time. ( ) 6.6.8 [13]\n[12]\nTummy time is important for many reasons:\n- Tummy time helps prevent flat spots on the back of an infant's head.\n- Makes neck and shoulder muscles stronger so infants can start to sit up, crawl, and walk.\n- Improves infant motor skills.\nInfants benefit from 2 to 3 tummy time sessions each day for a short period of time (3 to 5 minutes). As they grow and show enjoyment  of  tummy  time,  the  length  of  the  sessions  can  be  increased.  As  infants  grow  older,  more  tummy  time  helps  build strength for sitting up, rolling over, crawling, and walking. [12]\n[12]\nTummy Time Tips:\nThese suggestions can help make tummy time more enjoyable:\n- Spread out a blanket in a clear area of the floor for tummy time.\n- Try short tummy time sessions after a diaper change or after an infant wakes from a nap.\n- Put a toy or toys within an infant's reach during tummy time to help them learn to play and interact with their surroundings.\n- Have an adult be in the infant's field of view during tummy time to encourage interaction and bonding.\n- As an infant gets older, tummy time sessions can last longer, and can take place more often throughout the day."

    "context_enriched_content": "Gross Motor Development: Postural Affordances\nPostures-the  particular  body  and  limb  configurations  used  at  any  moment-mediate  motor  development  in  meaningful  ways (Rochat & Bullinger, 1994). For example, the acquisition of each new posture provides a unique lens through which infants can view the world as they accrue a range of motor possibilities for moving about and physically interacting with the environment (e.g., Adolph, 2008; Thurman & Corbetta, 2019). [14]\nDepending on the motor skill level and posture used, physical interactions with objects can be facilitated or reduced. For example, when sitting, infants' hands are free allowing them to manually manipulate and explore objects in sophisticated ways ( Lobo & Galloway, 2013; Lobo et al., 2014; Rochat, 1989; Soska & Adolph, 2014; Soska, Adolph & Johnson, 2010). When in a prone position (lying abdomen down), however, infants are limited to using one hand to lift their torso up off the ground, while using the other to reach out for an object, which greatly reduces the range of actions (Rocha & Tudella, 2008). In older infants, crawling and walking positions have different affordances. During crawling, infants are less likely than walking infants to carry objects (Karasik et  al.,  2012).  In  comparison, when walking, infants' hands are free to interact with objects in complex ways and the change of position opens up a new field of view for further exploration. Thus, each posture provides unique affordances on how the body can be used (Adolph, 2008). Consider Figure which shows an image of an infant holding an object with one hand while using the other hand for balance. In which ways does the infant's current crawling posture afford and restrict how the infant can explore the object? If the infant transitioned into a standing or walking position, how would the affordances and restrictions change? 6.6.9 [14]\nFigure : Infant holding an object with one hand while using the other hand for balance. ( ) 6.6.9 [15]\nPostures can also alter the stability of the body, the demand of attentional resources, and what can be perceived in the surroundings (Franchak,  Kretch  &  Adolph,  2018;  Kretch,  Franchak  &  Adolph,  2014).  Certain  postures  and  their  relative  stability  can  even influence the use of the limbs and hands. For example, transitioning from sitting to crawling, and from crawling to walking affects the way infants use their arms for reaching and retrieving objects (Corbetta & Bojczyk, 2002; Corbetta & Thelen, 2002). Unstable postures  often  require  more  of  the  infants'  effort  for  balance  such  as  when  the  hands  are  needed  to  hold  onto  surfaces  during cruising (Berger, Chan & Adolph, 2014), or when the hands may be needed to balance the body when standing is a new motor skill still being learned (Ledebt, 2000). When the hands are used for balance, they are less likely to be used for holding and exploring objects. [14]\nThus, research has shown that postural progression and postural control can influence infants' experiences with objects, people, and their  wider  environments.  Infants'  expanding  repertoire  of  postural  skills  as  they  acquire  locomotor  skills,  affects  their manipulatory behaviors and interactive activities with objects in their surroundings.

    "context_enriched_content": "Gross Motor Development: Environmental Affordances\nThink about the physical environment where you live, how does the furniture influence where and how people stand and sit, where eating takes place, the posture and arrangement people are in when socializing, how objects like televisions, windows or fireplaces influence the structure and positioning of furniture which results in how and where people sit and orient in the room, etc. Just as the physical environment is important for considering how adults sit, stand and move about in a space, the physical environment for infants and toddlers affords various physical movement possibilities.\nFigure : Infant using a structure for support while standing. ( ) 6.6.10 [16]\nThe theory of affordance (Gibson, 1950; 2014) represents an important theoretical framework for considering the environment's role  in  supporting  and  encouraging  physical  development  in  infants  and  toddlers.  In  this  theory,  the  physical  environment  is believed  to  afford  or  allow  the  child  possibilities  and  actions.  The  characteristics  and  features  of  the  indoor  environment  can therefore be hypothesized to influence children's gross motor development. The affordances of the physical environment are what the environment offers the child. For example, a toddler's classroom's affordances are the physical size of the classroom, the toys and materials available, the number of peers for potential play partners, and adults who set up the play environment, ensure its overall safety, manage the day-to-day operations, and interact with the children. [17] [18]\nFigure : Structure supporting gross motor development inside a toddler classroom. ( ) 6.6.11 [1]\nLet's look again at the gross motor windows of achievement for six gross motor milestones chart again (Figure ).  The  six milestones in the chart are sitting without support, standing with assistance, hand and knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone. 6.6.12\nFigure : Windows of achievement for six gross motor milestones. Sitting without support 3.8 - 9.4, Standing with assistance 4.8-11.7 months, Hands-&-knees crawling 5.2-13.9 months, Walking with assistance 6.0 - 14.1 months, Standing alone 6.9 - 17.4 months, Walking alone 8.2 - 18.0 months 6.6.12\n[20]\n(\n)\nFor  each  milestone,  how  could  the  physical  environment  support  and  encourage  the  infant  or  toddler  as  they  progress  toward achieving a specific milestone? For example, consider the milestone of standing with assistance, what role could the environment have? As the child is not yet able to stand independently, they are taking advantage of structures in the environment that afford assistance in getting into a standing position and remaining upright. Therefore, structures that allow a child to hold onto and pull up are important, as are structures that can be used for support to remain standing. When an environment includes structures at a low height, it supports a child's progress toward achieving this milestone. If an environment only has high structures built for adults, the motor and movement possibilities for a child are more limited.\nCaregivers should consider how both the indoor and outdoors environments afford infants and toddlers the opportunity to practice and challenge their current motor skills safely. As caregivers observe and reflect upon the motor development progress of infants and toddlers they should consider how to modify the environment to continue to support and encourage motor development. For example, for infants practicing standing with support, caregivers should ensure there are structures that can be used to help infants pull  themselves  up  and  offer  continual  support  at  an  appropriate  height.  Outside,  is  the  play  equipment  age-appropriate  and supportive  of  gross  motor  development?  Figure shows  two  angles  of  the  same  play  structure  geared  for  toddlers. Considering the construction of it, what elements are there that can support the developmental progression of toddlers' gross motor skills? While parts of the structure may be challenging for some toddlers, what elements are built in to support toddlers as their gross motor skills improve? 6.6.13\nFigure : Outside structure supporting toddler gross motor development. .

    "context_enriched_content": "Fine Motor Development\nFine motor skills involve more exact movements of the feet, toes, hands, and fingers. While fine motor skills are slower to develop (in accordance with the proximodistal trend), remarkable progress is made in fine motor development during the first two years. In just the first few years of life, children go from having no intentional fine motor control to being able to manipulate objects to play and learn, as well as beginning to take care of themselves. [22]\nJust as with gross motor milestones, there are complex developments that lead up to achieving specific fine motor milestones. Take for example the fine motor milestone of grasping an object. Reaching to grasp an object, which could be perceived as a relatively simple  action,  requires  a  complex  compilation  of  smaller  abilities  working  synchronously  together.  Successful  reaching  to  a stimulus, whether it is located on the body or in external space, typically involves the coordination of at least two different action systems: reaching and grasping (Jeannerod, 1996). Effective reaching requires individuals not only to extend their hands to the location  of  an  object,  but  to  also  open  and  orient  the  hand  to  prepare  to  grasp  the  specific  object.  Developmentally,  research indicates that the reaching system develops before grasping (Piaget, 1952; Bruner, 1973), reflecting a proximodistal sequence in the development of grasping (Lockman & Ashmead, 1983). For example, before 4 months, infants develop the ability to extend their hand to the location of an object (Bruner & Koslowski, 1972; Piaget, 1952), but during this period the hand is often fisted when it contacts the object. By 4 months, however, infants begin to open the hand in advance of contacting the object. Likewise, with regard to self-touch, closed hand contacts prevail in the first 2 or 3 months, and open hand contacts begin to increase in frequency between 3 and 5 months (Thomas, Karl & Whishaw, 2015). [23]\nEven after  infants  achieve  the  ability  to  reach  for  and  grasp  an  object,  there  is  still  further  development  in  this  milestone  that occurs. There is an improvement in reaching kinematics as 6 month-old infants develop a straight arm trajectory accompanied by fewer  movements  (Von  Hofsten,  1991).  During  this  phase  of  reaching  development,  there  are  many  factors  that  influence  arm trajectory; however, the development of postural control for maintaining stability during reaching is one of the most significant (Bertenthal & Von Hofsten, 1998). Since reaching requires 'whole body engagement' (Rochat & Goubet, 1995), its achievement is highly dependent on posture. At about 3 months, when arm extensions are being replaced by goal directed reaches but upright sitting is not mastered, infant reaching is better with external support. As infants generate the ability to sit independently, reaching becomes more coordinated and they can use their body to balance as they reach outward.

    "context_enriched_content": "Development of Grasping\nThe  development  of  grasping  is  an  important  part  of  fine  motor  development.  As  infants  and  toddlers  develop,  they  progress through different types of grasps. Children are born with a palmar reflex grasp. It is an involuntary reflexive response present in newborns, but begins to appear around 16 weeks gestation (Sherer, 1993). To elicit the reflex, a caregiver can use their finger to stroke  the  palm  of  the  infant.  The  palmar  grasp  reflex  comprises  two  phases:  finger  closure  and  clinging.  The  infant's  fingers undergo flexion to enclose the examiner's finger and the pressure applied to the palm produces traction on the fingers' tendons, leading to the clinging action. The thumb is not involved in this reflex. The palmar grasp reflex disappears typically by six months of age, signifying healthy brain maturation and is replaced by the development of voluntary grasping (Schott & Rossor, 2003). The palmar  reflex  probably  serves  to  create  a  basic  motor  pattern  that  lays  the  foundation  for  obtaining  later  grasping  ability. Additionally, it creates interaction and bonding between the infant and the caregiver. [26]\nThe palmar reflex grasp is replaced by the ulnar grasp, which is a 'clumsy motion in which an infant's fingers close against the palm' (Berk & Meyers, 2016). The ulnar grasp typically develops around 3 to 4 months of age and increases infants' ability to explore objects. As infants learn to sit independently, both hands are freed up to explore objects; therefore around 4 to 5 months of age infants are able to transfer objects between their hands. The pincer grasp is when the pointer finger and the thumb squeeze together to grasp an object. Infants are usually able to perform a pincer grasp by the age of 9 to 10 months (Sgandurra et al., 2012). With each change in grasping ability, infants are able to interact with different objects and in new ways. For example, the ulnar grasp only allows for larger objects to be held onto while the pincer grasp permits an infant to pick up smaller objects.\nPalmar grasp reflex (newborn)\nUlnar grasp (3-4 months of age)\nTransferring object from hand to hand (4-5 months of age)\nPincer grasp (3-4 months of age)\nFigure : Development of grasping during infancy. ( ) 6.6.15 [27]\nTo  support  infants,  caregivers  should  carefully  observe  infants'  grasping  progression  and  provide  materials  that  can  easily  be manipulated based on their current grasping techniques. Active object exploration emerges around 3 to 6 months of age with the onset of reaching and grasping (Lobo & Galloway, 2008; Rochat, 1989; Ruff, 1984). At 6 months of age, infants spend the majority of  their  time  mouthing  and  grasping  objects  and  this  sharply  declined  with  concurrent  improvements  in  complex  manual exploratory  behaviors  such  as  fingering,  transferring,  and  rotating  objects  (Belsky  &  Most,  1981;  Ruff,  1984).  As  a  result, caregivers should provide young infants with materials that they can easily grasp onto and that are safe for mouthing. Once infants begin to sit and develop more complex grasping techniques, such as the ulnar grasp, caregivers should provide materials that are more  complex  in  design  characteristics,  but  still  light,  easy  to  hold  in  one  hand,  easy  to  transfer  between  hands  and  safe  for mouthing.

    "context_enriched_content": "Development of Grasping\nInfant  exploratory  behaviors  are  influenced  by  object  properties  including  size,  shape,  texture,  and  weight  of  objects.  Infants change their grasping patterns depending on object size-smaller objects are grasped unimanually and larger objects are grasped bimanually.  Research  has  demonstrated  variations  in  infants'  grasping  patterns  based  on  object  structure,  such  as  two-handed grasps for larger objects and pincer grips for smaller and softer objects (Newell et al., 1989; Newman et al., 2001). Additionally, 12 to  14  month  old  infants  showed  appropriate,  anticipatory  changes  in  grasp  formation  based  on  object  shape  and  size  (Barrett, Traupman & Needham, 2008; Fagard, 2000). Nine to twelve month old infants explored object properties such as shape, size, and texture by rotating, fingering, and transferring objects, whereas they explored properties such as weight, sound, and rigidity by banging and shaking objects (Ruff, 1984). This research suggests that with older infants, caregivers should provide materials that\nare  more  complex  in  design  and  diverse  in  characteristics  such  as  size,  shape,  texture  and  weight.  As  older  infants  use  their developing grasping abilities to explore materials, caregivers can continue to observe how they interact with the materials, and provide materials based on what characteristics infants seem most interested in exploring.

    "context_enriched_content": "Culture and Childcare Practices\nDespite a common sequence of motor skill acquisition, there are individual differences in age for the acquisition of motor skills, highlighting  the  importance  of  the  physical  environment  and  caregiver  practices.  Ever  since  milestone  charts  attempted  to document what 'normal' ages to achieve motor milestones are, variation  in  type  and  timing  of  motor  development  have  been reported (Karasik et al., 2015). For example, motor development in non-Western countries was found to differ from Western norms and these differences were related to differences in caregiving practices (Adolph et al., 2010; Cintas, 1995; Karasik et al., 2015). Even within the 'Western world', there is cultural variability in the timing of motor milestone attainment (e.g., De Kegel et al., 2013; Steenis et al., 2015; WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group and de Onis, 2006). [1]\nFigure : Caregiver supporting an infant's walking practice. ( ) 6.7.1 [2]\nDifferences in cultural beliefs and caregiving practices lead to differences in when children achieve motor milestones (OudgenoegPaz, Atun-Einy & van Schaik, 2020). For example, there are differences between Dutch and Israeli caregivers in their beliefs about motor  development  (Van  Schaik  et  al.,  2018),  such  that  Israeli  caregivers  attribute  more  importance  to  encouraging  motor development in the 'right' order and obtaining expert advice. Dutch caregivers, on the other hand, attribute greater importance to letting children follow their own pace in motor development (Van Schaik et al., 2018). Studies show that motor development of Dutch children is delayed compared to children in other western countries, including Israel (Shapira & Harel, 1983; Steenis et al., 2015). [3]\nFigure : Mother from Sierra Leone in West Africa wearing an infant on her back. ( ) 6.7.1 [4]\nThe body of cross-cultural research further supports the perspective that motor development is not a universal process-the social and physical environment has a significant role. For example, practicing standing and sitting, and applying massage or stretching of\nthe  limbs  is  common  in  African  and  Caribbean  cultures  but  less  common  in  Western  cultures  (Adolph  et  al.,  2010;  Super  & Harkness, 2015). [5]\nIn Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia a traditional caregiving practice involves 'gahvora' cradling. Children from birth to 20 months of age are bound on their backs in a tightly wrapped swaddle with arms extended along the sides of the torso and legs straightened and tied together for more than 20 hours per day for some children (Karasik et al., 2018). Infants are not unwrapped for  feeding  because  mothers  lean  over  the  cradle  to  breastfeed  and  they  are  not  removed  for  toileting  because  infants  urinate through an external catheter and defecate through a hole in the bottom of the cradle. [6]\nAccording  to  the  prevailing  view  among  pediatricians  and  psychologists,  severe  movement  restriction  in  infancy  could  have deleterious effects, especially across the first two years of ife, a critical period in children's health and development (Cunha, Leite & Almeida, 2015). For example, the extended and abducted position of the legs, especially in the first few months, could lead to hip dysplasia or pigeon-toed gait (Clarke, 2014; Van Sleuwen et al., 2007). Extended time in the supine position could lead to brachycephaly  (flattening  of  the  back  of  the  head  (Graham  et  al.,  2005;  van  Vlimmeren  et  al.,  2017).  Restricted  movementespecially in older infants-could delay development of postural and locomotor skills (Adolph & Robinson, 2015).

It is important to note that in Tajik families, children are prized and the center of family life. Tajik caregivers responded immediately to vocalizations from their cradled infants by feeding them, rocking them, or singing to them. Mothers,  grandmothers,  aunts, neighbors, and  older siblings were  available, interchangeable, and responsive and Tajik children of all ages, including siblings and village children, surrounded the gahvora and interacted with the infant.

For the 44 infants in Group 2 (red dots) time in the gahvora occurred in short bursts, primarily between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m M = 6.09.

    "context_enriched_content": "Mother Development and Other Developmental Domains\nWhile motor development is often presented as an individual chapter separate from other developmental domains (e.g., language, social-emotional, cognition) the reality is that children's motor abilities are developing alongside these other domains and growth in one  domain  often  influences  the  other  domains.  Motor  skills  are  at  the  core  of  infants'  and  toddlers'  everyday  actions  and interactions  and  consequently  affect  subsequent  perceptual,  cognitive,  and  language  development  (Bushnell  &  Boudreau,  1993; Gibson, 1988). Piaget (1952) suggested a relation between motor and cognitive development and noted that infants' own actions and resulting sensorimotor experiences are critical for their learning about the environment and the objects within it. Since Piaget's original  observations,  several  studies  have  reported  evidence  for  relations  between  motor  skills  and  development  in  seemingly unrelated domains. [1]\nGrowing evidence suggests that acquiring more advanced control over body position affords infants' opportunities for learning and exploration (Franchak, 2020; Gibson, 1988; Libertus & Hauf, 2017). For example, infants' visual experiences differ according to body position: while prone, infants' field of view is dominated by the ground surface and objects near the body, whereas upright infants have a more expansive view of their surroundings that includes distant objects and faces (Franchak et al., 2011, 2018; Luo & Franchak, 2020; Kretch et al., 2014). Sitting facilitates visual and manual exploration of objects compared with laying prone or supine  (Luo  &  Franchak,  2020;  Soska  &  Adolph,  2014).  Upright  locomotion  (walking)  compared  with  prone  locomotion (crawling) allows infants to travel farther, more easily carry objects, and elicits different social responses from caregivers (Adolph & Tamis-LeMonda, 2014; Gibson, 1988; Karasik et al., 2014). Accordingly, learning to sit and walk is linked with downstream improvements in language learning and spatial cognition (He et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2019; Oudgenoeg-Paz et al., 2012, 2015; Soska et al., 2010; Walle, 2016; Walle & Campos, 2014; West et al., 2019). Presumably, these facilitative effects result from infants spending  more  time  sitting,  standing,  and  walking.  For  example,  mastering  the  ability  to  sit  independently  nearly  doubled  the amount of time that 6 month olds spent sitting (both independent and supported sitting) in daily life compared with 6 month old not yet  sitting  (Franchak,  2019)  and  infants  who  spend more time sitting have increased opportunities to explore objects with both hands.

    "context_enriched_content": "Developmental Cascades Theory\nThe developmental cascades hypothesis emphasizes the consequences following achievement of new motor skills as a driving force during development. Developmental cascades refer to the cumulative consequences of advances in one domain (e.g., motor skills) on  later  behaviors  or  abilities  (Fry  &  Hale,  1996;  Gottlieb,  1991;  Masten  &  Cicchetti,  2010).  Gaining  a  new  skill  leads  to significant and long lasting changes in the child's everyday experience by altering what kind of information is accessible and how others respond to the child. According to the developmental cascades theory, the onset of a new motor skill may provide infants with access to new learning opportunities associated with that motor skill. For example, being able to sit without support frees the hands for manual exploration of objects and enables learning about object features such as weight, texture, and function (Lederman & Klatzky, 2009; Rochat & Goubet, 1995). Sitting also frees the hands for the production of communicative gestures, which have been found to support language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). Further, sitting changes the infants' point-ofview, providing novel perceptual experiences and encouraging face-to-face exchanges with their caregivers. And finally, parents react to changes in infants' abilities and adjust how they respond to the child (e.g., Karasik et al., 2014). [1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Relationship Between Motor Skills and Language Development\nWhile motor and language development may seem like two very different developmental areas, research has shown, within the first three years of life, that these two areas are strongly related (Schneider & Iverson, 2021). Infants and toddlers who achieve motor milestones earlier show greater language abilities. For example, in a large group of children between 10 to 14 months of age, some will be walking while others will not yet be able to walk. Children who begin to walk earlier have larger receptive and productive vocabularies than those who are not yet able to walk (Carina, Leinweber & Ritterfeld, 2019; He, Walle & Campos, 2015; Walle & Campos, 2014). The onset of independent sitting and walking have both been found to predict later productive vocabulary sizes between  16  and  28  months  (Oudgenoeg-Paz,  Volman  &  Leseman,  2012).  This  relationship  between  motor  development  and language development actually begins even earlier. Infants, between 3 to 5 months of age, who can independently sit earlier than others, show greater language abilities as toddlers (Libertus & Violi, 2016). A large study of 62,944 children found that motor skills at  18  months  were  predictive  of  subsequent  language  skills  at  36  months  of  age  (Wang,  Lekhal,  Aarø  &  Schjølberg,  2014).  In\naddition to gross motor skills, fine motor skills between 12 and 18 months of age have been found to predict expressive language at 36 months in infants at a high genetic risk for ASD (LeBarton & Iverson, 2013). [1]\nWhy is there a relationship between motor abilities and later language abilities? It is unlikely that the acquisition of walking per se causes infants  to  develop  language,  just  as  it  is  unlikely  that  infant  language  causes  the  onset  of  walking.  Rather,  the  onset  of walking increases the infant's visual field (Kretch et al., 2014) and permits greater flexibility with which to view the environment (Frank et al., 2013). These physical changes may promote infant following of adult attentional cues, and thereby facilitate language learning. Engaging in joint attention behavior is essential for the development of language (Tomasello, 1988, 1995). Such episodes of joint engagement occur when one individual directs the attention of another to a shared referent, such as an object or event. Multiple studies have found that infant following of adult attentional cues is related to language development (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2005; Morales et al., 1998; Mundy et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1988; Tomasello & Todd, 1983). Likewise, infant initiation of joint engagement, such as pointing, is associated with later language development (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2008; LeBarton et al., 2015). Perhaps not surprisingly, infant joint attention, particularly following adult gaze, also develops markedly following the infant's first birthday (Morales et al., 2000; Morissette et al., 1995), when infants typically begin to walk. [3]\nFurthermore, infant walking also has a significant impact on how the infant engages with the caregiver. Walking infants have been observed to be more likely to access objects located further away than crawling infants (Clearfield, 2011; Karasik et al., 2011). Additionally, engaging in mobile bids for the parent's attention, such as carrying an object to the parent, elicits more interactive, and verbally rich responses by the parent and such bids are more frequent by walking than crawling infants (Karasik et al., 2014). Walking infants have also been found to direct the parent's attention to objects using vocalizations and gestures more than crawling infants (Clearfield et al., 2008; Clearfield, 2011; Karasik et al., 2011). These findings indicate that not only may the walking infant be more attuned to follow adult attentional cues, but they also help to generate social contexts in which they themselves elicit parent attention. The onset of walking affords infants new ways to communicate (freeing the hands for gesture and by being able to carry move objects) and share their interests which results in richer language from caregivers (West & Iverson, 2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Relationship between Motor Skills and Developmental Delays and Disabilities\nAs motor development can be tracked early on in infancy and toddlerhood, motor skills can be used as a potential early marker for later  outcomes  in  children  at-risk  of  a  delay  or  disability  (Bhat  et  al.,  2012;  Flanagan  et  al.,  2012;  Lebarton  &  Iverson,  2013; Libertus  et  al.,  2014).  Research  has  found  that  delays  in  motor  development  are  linked  to  diagnoses  such  as  Autism  Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and developmental language disorders (Leonard & Hill, 2014; West, 2018). Infants at high familial risk for ASD (infants, who have an older sibling with an ASD diagnosis) and who receive an ASD diagnosis later in childhood, show reduced fine motor and grasping skills (Choi, Leech, Tager-Flusberg & Nelson, 2018; Libertus et al., 2014) and delayed development of posture skills (i.e., sitting and standing) (Nickel et al., 2013). More children with a developmental language disorder are late in reaching gross and particularly fine motor milestones, than children without a developmental language disorder (Diepeveen et al, 2018). Motor delays are also commonly reported in children with Down syndrome (Vicari, 2006), Williams syndrome (Masataka, 2001) and in children born preterm (Cameron et al., 2021; Caravale et al., 2005; van Haastert et al., 2006).

Our sensory system begins to form in utero and continues to develop through adulthood. It is important to note that genetic, environmental, and stress factors can affect the sensory system.

    "context_enriched_content": "Perception\nPerception  refers  to  the  process  of  taking  in,  organizing,  and  interpreting  sensory  information.  Perception  is  multimodal,  with multiple sensory inputs contributing to motor responses (Bertenthal, 1996). An infant's turning his head in response to the visual and auditory cues of the sight of a face and the sound of a voice exemplifies this type of perception, \"the fact that the senses provide overlapping information . . . is a cornerstone of perceptual development\" (Bahrick, Lickliter, & Flom 2004).[1]\nAs infants develop increasing motor competence, they use perceptual information to decide which motor actions to take (Adolph & Joh, 2007). For example, they may adjust their crawling or walking in response to the rigidity, slipperiness, or slant of surfaces (Adolph,  1997).  Motor  movements,  including  movements  of  the  eyes,  arms,  legs,  and  hands,  provide  most  of  the  perceptual information infants receive (Adolph and Berger 2006). Young children's bodies undergo remarkable changes in the early childhood years.  In  describing  this  development,  Adolph  and  Avolio  (2000,  p.1148)  state,  \"Newborns  are  extremely  top-heavy  with  large heads and torsos and short, weak legs. As infants grow, their body fat and muscle mass redistribute.[1]\nIn contrast to newborns, toddlers' bodies have a more cylindrical shape, and they have a larger ratio of muscle mass to body fat, especially  in  the  legs.\"  These  changes  in  weight,  size,  percentage  of  body  fat,  and  muscle  strength  provide  perceptual/motor challenges to infants as they practice a variety of actions (Adolph & Berger, 2006). This dramatic physical development occurs within the broad context of overall growth. As infants master each challenge, their perceptual and motor behavior reflects their social environment.[1]\nThe extent and variety of infant perceptual and motor behavior are remarkable. Infants and toddlers spend a significant part of their days engaged in motor behavior of one type or another. By three and a half months of age, infants have made between three and six million  eye  movements during their waking hours (Haith, Hazen, & Goodman, 1988). Infants who crawl and walk have spent roughly half of their waking hours involved in motor behavior, approximately five to six hours per day (Adolph & Joh, 2007, p.11). Daily infants who are walking \". . . take more than 9,000 steps and travel the distance of more than 29 football fields. They travel over nearly a dozen different indoor and outdoor surfaces varying in friction, rigidity, and texture. They visit nearly every room in their homes, and they engage in balance and locomotion in the context of varied activities\" (Adolph & Berger, 2006, p. 181).\nEarly research in motor development involved detailed observational studies that documented the progression of infant motor skills and presented an understanding of infant motor behavior as a sequence of universal, biologically programmed steps (Adolph & Berger,  2006;  Bertenthal  &  Boker,  1997;  Bushnell  &  Boudreau,  1993;  Pick,  1989).  In  comparison,  current  research  in  motor development often emphasizes action in the context of behavior and development in the perceptual, cognitive, and social domains (Pick,  1989).  In  particular,  contemporary  accounts  of  infant  motor  development  address  (1)  the  strong  relationship  between perception  and  action  (Bertenthal  1996;  Gibson  1988;  Thelen  1995),  (2)  the  relationship  between  actions  and  the  environment (Gibson 1988; Thelen 1995), and (3) the importance of motives in motor behavior, notably social and explorative motives (von Hofsten 2007). How these developing behaviors and abilities play a role in  the  social/emotional  aspects  of  the  child's  life  and functioning, such as forming early relationships and building an understanding of others, is noteworthy.[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Perception\nThe current view suggests that thinking about perceptual/motor development includes infants and toddlers with disabilities or other special needs. Children whose disabilities affect their perceptual or motor development still want to explore and interact with the people and environment around them. Although the perceptual and motor development of children with disabilities or other special needs may follow a pathway that differs from typical developmental trajectories, sensitive and responsive caregivers can provide alternative ways in which to engage children's drive to explore, building on their interests and strengths and supporting their overall physical and psychological health.[1]\nFor years,  researchers,  educators,  and  early  childhood  professionals  have  emphasized  the  interrelatedness  of  the  developmental domains.  Current  research  supports  an  even  greater  understanding  of  the  relatedness  and  dependence  of  factors,  domains,  and processes  in  development  (Diamond  2007).  The  developmental  domains  are  linked  with  factors  such  as  culture,  social relationships,  experience,  physical  health,  mental  health,  and  brain  functioning  (Diamond  2007).  In  the  case  of  perceptual  and motor  behavior,  Diamond  (2007)  has  observed  that  perception,  motor  behavior,  and  cognition  occur  in  the  context  of  culture, emotion, social relationships, and experience, which influences physical and mental health and overall health brain functioning. Bertenthal (1996) has proposed that perception and motor action are interrelated rather than autonomous processes. They may be best viewed as different components of a system. Common behaviors such as reaching and turning the head for visual tracking illustrate  the  interrelatedness  of  infant  development's  motor,  perceptual,  cognitive,  and  social-emotional  domains.  Even  as  very\nyoung  infants,  children  are  highly  motivated  to  explore,  gain  information,  attend,  and  engage  in  their  physical  and  social environments (Gibson 1987). As Gibson (1988, pg. 5) explains, We don't simply see, we look. \"Research by Berthier (1996, 811) indicates that \"infant reaching is not simply a neural program that is triggered by the presence of a goal object, but that infants match the kinematics of their reaches to the task and their goals.\"\nPerception  and  motor  action  play  a  key  role  in  children's  experiences  and  psychological  processes  (Thelen  1995).  They  also contribute to human psychological development since, ultimately, \"behavior is movement\" (Adolph and Berger 2005,p 223), and psychology can be defined as the study of human behavior. It has been proposed that infants' use of social information to guide their motor behavior in physically challenging or unfamiliar situations provides an excellent means to study infant social cognition (Tamis-LeMonda and Adolph 2005).[1]\n- [1] California Department of Education (CDE Press).

Two terms are essential to understand when learning about the senses. The first is sensation , or the interaction of information with the sensory receptors. The second is perception or the process of interpreting what is sensed. Someone can sense something without perceiving it. Gradually, infants become more adept at perceiving with their senses, making them more aware of their environment and presenting more affordances or opportunities to interact with objects.[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Vision\nWhat can young infants see, hear, and smell? Newborn infants' sensory abilities are significant, but their senses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn's innate preferences facilitate interaction with caregivers and other humans. The womb is a dark environment  void  of  visual  stimulation.  Consequently,  vision  is  the  most  poorly  developed  sense  at  birth.  Newborns  typically cannot see further than 8 to 16 inches away from their faces, have difficulty keeping a moving object within their gaze, and can detect  contrast  more  than  color  differences.  If  you  have  ever  seen  a  newborn  struggle  to  see,  you  can  appreciate  the  cognitive efforts being made to take in visual stimulation and build those neural pathways between the eye and the brain.\nAlthough vision is their least developed sense, newborns already prefer faces. When you glance at a person, where do you look? Chances are you look into their eyes. If so, why? It is probably because there is more information there than in other parts of the face. Newborns do not scan objects this way; rather, they tend to look at the chin or another less detailed part of the face. However, by 2 or 3 months, they will seek more detail when visually exploring an object and begin showing preferences for unusual images over familiar ones, for patterns over solids, faces over patterns, and three-dimensional objects over flat images. Newborns have difficulty distinguishing between colors, but within a few months, are able to distinguish between colors as well as adults. Infants can also sense depth as binocular vision develops at about 2 months. By 6 months, the infant can perceive depth in pictures (Sen, Yonas, & Knill, 2001). Infants who have experience crawling and exploring will pay greater attention to visual cues of depth and modify their actions accordingly (Berk, 2007).[1]"

The  ability  to  hear  is  evidenced  as  soon  as  the  5th  month  of  prenatal development. An infant can distinguish between very similar sounds as early as one month after birth and can differentiate between a familiar and non-familiar voice even earlier. Babies who are just a few days old prefer human voices, they will listen to voices longer than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their mother's voice over a stranger's  voice  (Mills  &  Melhuish,  1974).  In  an  interesting  experiment,  3-week-old  babies  were  given  pacifiers  that  played  a recording of the infant's mother's voice and of a stranger's voice. When the infants heard their mother's voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). Some of this ability will be lost by 7 or 8 months as a child becomes familiar with the sounds of a particular language and less sensitive to sounds that are part of an unfamiliar language.[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Pain and Touch\nImmediately after birth, a newborn is sensitive to touch and temperature and is also sensitive to pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular responses. Newborns who are circumcised (the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis) without anesthesia experience pain, as demonstrated by increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress hormones (United States National Library of Medicine, 2016). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), there  are  medical  benefits  and  risks  to  circumcision.  They  do  not  recommend  routine  circumcision;  however,  they  stated  that because of the possible benefits (including prevention of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and some STDs), parents should have the option to circumcise their sons if they want to (AAP, 2012) [1]\nThe sense of touch is acute in infants and is essential to a baby's growth of physical abilities, language and cognitive skills, and socio-emotional  competency.  Touch  impacts  not  only  short-term  development  during  infancy  and  early  childhood  but  also  has long-term effects, suggesting the power of positive, gentle touch from birth. Through touch, infants learn about their world, bond with  their  caregivers,  and  communicate  their  needs  and  wants.  Research  emphasizes  the  great  benefits  of  touch  for  premature babies, but the presence of such contact has been shown to benefit all children (Stack, D. M. (2010). In an extreme example, some children in Romania were reared in orphanages in which a single care worker may have had as many as 10 infants to care for at one\ntime.  These  infants  were  not  often  helped  or  given  toys  with  which  to  play.  As  a  result,  many  of  them  were  developmentally delayed (Nelson, Fox, & Zeanah, 2014). [1]"

They can distinguish between their mother's scent and that of others and prefer the smell of their mothers. A newborn placed on the mother's chest will inch up to the mother's breast, as it is a potent source of the maternal odor. Even on the first day of life, infants orient to their mother's odor and are soothed when crying by their mother's odor (Sullivan et al., 2011).[1]"

For example, those skills can be observed when an infant gazes into a caregiver's eyes or distinguishes between familiar and unfamiliar people. Infants use perception to distinguish environment features, such as height, depth, and color. \"The human infant is recognized today as 'perceptually competent'; determining just how the senses function in infancy helps to specify the perceptual world of babies\" (Bornstein 2005, p 284). Infants explore objects differently depending upon object features such as weight, texture, sound, or rigidity (Palmer 1989). Parents and professionals may have observed young children exploring a slope, such as a slide, by touching it with their hands or feet before deciding whether to slide down it. Research by Adolph, Eppler, and Gibson (1993) suggests that learning plays a part in young children's decisionmaking in physically risky situations, such as navigating slopes, and that exploratory behavior may be a means to this learning. Perception is also strongly related to the social-emotional domain, such as when young children perceive the differences between various facial expressions and come to understand what they may mean.[1]\n- [1] California Department of Education (CDE Press).

While objective and quantitative studies in very young children are challenging, a study  by  (Lewkowicz  and  Turkewitz  1980)  measured  3-4  week-old  infants'  heart  rates.  It  showed  that  these  children  could associate light and sound intensities. More recent results have shown that newborn infants can match numerosity across the senses (Izard et al. 2009) and that 4-month-old infants are sensitive to the spatial congruence of auditory-tactile events (Thomas et al. 2018). However, one constraint of most studies on infants and young children is that they are typically based on child-appropriate behavioral measures, such as preferential looking. Consequently, they provide limited insights into the putative neurobiological mechanisms and maturation of multisensory processes.[1]\n[1] Maitre, N.L., Key, A.P., Slaughter, J.C. et al.

Sensory  processing  disorder  (SPD)  has  been  described  as  a  distinct  neurodevelopmental  disorder  in  the  literature (Schoen et al., 2009; Jorquera-Cabrera et al., 2017; Crasta et al., 2020). It now has been recognized in the most recent version of the diagnostic classification of mental and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood-revised (DC: 0-5, zero to three). Sensory processing abilities develop naturally and play essential roles in child learning, behavior and emotional regulation, motor development, and task performance. Sensory processing disorder has been defined as the brain's inability to organize sensory input for  appropriate  use.  As  stated  in  the  DC:  0-5,  zero  to  three-manual,  SPD  is  diagnosed  based  on  difficulties  in  detecting, modulating, interpreting, or organizing sensory stimuli to the extent that these deficits impair daily functioning and participation. However,  the  question  of  whether  deficits  in  sensory  processing  represent  the  symptoms  of  another  disorder,  such  as  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), or SPD is its distinct condition remains (Borkowska  and Sklodowska, 2017).[1]\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2012 recommended that SPD generally should not be diagnosed citing that there is no universally accepted framework for the SPD diagnosis. Although sensory processing problems were recognized as important to identify and address, the AAP stated that there lacked evidence to solidly demonstrate that children presenting with sensory-based problems  have  an  actual  \"disorder\"  of  the  brain's  sensory  pathways.  They  concluded  sensory  processing  deficits  were  likely associated with other developmental and behavioral disorders. This view, however, does not account for children who present with sensory processing deficits affecting their daily life who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any other disorder[1].\nExperts in the field characterized tSPD as having three main types: [1]\n- sensory modulation disorder (SMD): Sensory modulation refers to the ability to notice and react to, regulate, adapt to, and grade responses that are appropriate to the sensory situations experienced in daily life.\n- Sensory discrimination disorder (SDD); Sensory discrimination disorder refers to problems with accurately perceiving and interpreting sensory information coming in or experienced from one or more of the sensory systems (Miller et al., 2007; Lane and Reynolds, 2020; Parham and Mailloux, 2020). Discrimination abilities allow for recognizing qualitative and quantitative sensory features and differences among various objects and experiences processed through the sensory systems. People with this type can register sensory stimuli. However, appreciating or detecting the qualities of a given stimulus is a challenge and can occur with one or more sensory systems.\n- Sensory-based motor disorder (SBMD), is further divided into subtypes (Miller et al., 2007).\n- Sensory over-responsivity (SOR): Atypical behaviors associated with SOR are characterized by intense, exaggerated responses to sensory events that most children do not perceive as negative or obnoxious, often resulting in withdrawal and avoidance behavior.\n- Sensory under-responsivity (SUR): Atypical behaviors with SUR include muted or slowed responses to sensory experiences, often with an apparent lack of awareness, lethargy and/or indifference, or diminished responsivity.\n- Sensory craving (SC); is sometimes referred to as sensory seeking. Atypical behavior associated with SC includes a need for more intense sensory input than what one would typically want, or that would naturally occur, often manifesting as inappropriate, disruptive, disorganized and/or risky behavior (Miller et al., 2007, 2017; James et al., 2011; Schoen et al., 2014)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding Sensory Processing Differences\nPrevalence estimates of iSPD range from 5 to 16% of children in the general population, while 60-90% of children with coexisting neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been estimated to have sensory problems (Ahn et al., 2004; Ben-Sasson et al., 2009; James et al., 2011; Galiana-Simal et al., 2020; Jussila et al., 2020). Mulligan et al. (2019) reported that 20% of the children in their sample had a co-occurring disorder while the remaining 80% had not been diagnosed with another neurodevelopmental disorder. [1]\nUnfortunately, there are a limited number of diagnostic assessment tools available to evaluate the sensory processing abilities of children, and no tool is available for explicitly identifying and measuring the SPD types as described by Miller et al. (2007).[1]\nResearch evidence is building regarding how sensory processing deficits manifest within various populations and how iSPD may be differentiated among children with other neurodevelopmental conditions. As high as 90% of children with ASD have sensory\nprocessing difficulties, with the most common pattern of SPD being the SOR modulation subtype (Schoen et al., 2009; Tavassoli et al., 2014; Tomchek et al., 2014; Little et al., 2018).  Children  with  ASD  were  more  under-reactive  to  auditory  stimuli  but  overreactive to taste and smell.\nSensory  under-responsivity  has  been  associated  with  depressive  symptoms  and  internalizing  behaviors,  while  externalizing behaviors have been more related to sensory craving, and over-reactivity. Studies demonstrating how the symptoms of children with iSPD differ from those seen in children with other neurodevelopmental conditions, including ADHD and ASD are particularly relevant for supporting SPD as its own diagnostic entity. Miller et al. (2012) compared clinical assessment findings among samples of neurotypicals, children with ADHD, those with SMD, and those with dual diagnoses. All clinical groups had significantly more sensory, attention, activity, impulsivity, and emotional difficulties than typical children.

How is it possible that your brain is  able  to  move  from  one  thought  to  the  next  in  an  orderly  fashion?  Our  brains  are  always  active  as  they  endlessly  perceive, process, plan, organize, and remember. Upon waking each morning, you begin thinking-contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day. In what order should you run your errands? Should you go to the bank, the cleaners, or the grocery store first? Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done? These thoughts are one example of cognition at work. Simply put, cognition is thinking, and it  encompasses the processes associated  with  perception, knowledge,  problem  solving,  judgment,  language,  and  memory.  In  this  section  we  will  learn  about  how  cognition  develops  in infancy and toddlerhood. [1]\nFigure : Child pausing to examine a yellow block. ( ) 8.1.1 [2]\nSpielman et al., (2020).

    "context_enriched_content": "Jean Piaget\nThe scientific study of cognitive development in young children traces its roots back to the 20th century to Jean Piaget, a pioneer in the  field  of  child  development  (Piaget,  1954,  1983).  Piaget  described  children  as  active  learners  who,  through  continuous interactions  with  their  environments,  construct  a  complex  understanding  of  the  physical  world  around  them.  From  infancy  to adolescence,  children  progress  through  four  cognitive  stages:  (1)  the  sensorimotor  stage  from  birth  to  2  years  (when  cognitive functioning is based primarily on motor reflexes and perceptions); (2) the preoperational stage from 2 to 7 years (when symbolic thought and language become prevalent, but reasoning is illogical by adult standards); (3) the concrete operational stage from 7 to 12 years (when logical reasoning abilities emerge but are limited to concrete objects and events); and (4) the formal operational stage  at  around  12  years  (when  thinking  about  abstract,  hypothetical,  and  contrary-to-fact  ideas  becomes  possible).  The sensorimotor stage can further be divided into six substages.  The  sensorimotor  substages  divide  the  first  two  years  of  life  into phases. Each substage builds upon the previous stage as the child's cognition develops. During the first two years, Piaget stressed the central role sensory and motor abilities have on supporting early cognition. According to Piaget, infant and toddler cognitive development is primarily driven by motor and sensory interactions with the environment. [1]\nWhile Piaget's theory of cognitive development continues to be foundational in understanding infant and toddler cognition, Piaget's theory has many limitations. For example, research has revealed that infants have internal mechanisms of learning, not just motor and sensory abilities, that drive cognitive development such as the automatic number system and statistical learning (Saffran & Kirkham, 2018; Wang & Feigenson, 2021). Some researchers believe infants are born with core knowledge - innate systems that help infants learn about the physical and social world around them (Spelke & Kinzler, 2007; Stahl & Feigenson, 2019). Another limitation to his theory is that Piaget underestimated the cognitive abilities of infants and toddlers. As an example, Piaget (1954) suggested that object permanence did not begin to develop until 8 to 12 months of age, as indicated by younger infants' failures to search for hidden objects, but research has since discovered object permanence develops much earlier, around three to six months of age (Baillargeon, 1987; Bremner, Slater & Johnson, 2015).

    "context_enriched_content": "Studying Cognition\nInfants'  emerging  understanding  of  the  physical  and  social  world  is  commonly  investigated  by  using  violation-of-expectation experiments.  In  violation-of-expectation  experiments,  unexpected  events  that  violate  physical  or  social  rules  lead  to  different responses  in  infants'  gaze  behavior  (Baillargeon,  2004),  pupil  dilation  (Jackson  &  Sirois,  2009),  and  brain  responses  (Köster, Langeloh, & Hoehl, 2019). For example, infants detect impossible physical events, such as a ball rolling through a wall (Spelke et al., 1992), changes in numbers, such as when the number of toys changes (Simon, Hespos, & Rochat, 1995), or irrational human actions, such as a pretzel that is put toward the ear instead of the mouth (Reid et al., 2009). Interesting research on the development of  moral  cognition  used  the  violation-of-expectation  paradigm  and  a  cookie  scenario,  presented  in  Figure ,  to  study  the possibility  that  young  infants  might  expect  resources  to  be  divided  equally  between  similar  recipients  (Dawkins,  Sloane  & Baillargeon, 2019). Infants as young as four months of age expected an experimenter to divide two cookies equally between two similar  animated  puppets,  and  they  detected  a  violation  (measured  by  longer  looking  time)  when  the  researcher  divided  them unequally instead. 8.3.1 [1] [2]\nEqual Event\nUnequal Event\nFigure : Example of how an experiment on moral cognition used violation-of-expectation. ( ) 8.3.1 [3]\nA  second  common  method  to  study  cognition  in  infants  and  toddlers  is  called  habituation.  Many  prominent  studies  of  infant cognition over the past two decades have relied on the fact that infants habituate to repeated stimuli - i.e. that their looking times tend  to  decline  upon  repeated  stimulus  presentation  (Aslin,  2007;  Oakes,  2010).  Habituation  is  one  of  the  earliest  cognitive processes to emerge in development (Colombo & Mitchell, 2009) and reflects a basic form of learning: once a stimulus is fully encoded in the mind, the infant habituates to it and demonstrates decreased attention to the stimulus. Researchers have found that the  duration  of  time  to  habituate  in  infancy  accounts  for  up  to  30  percent  of  the  variance  in  cognitive  ability  at  older  ages (Bornstein & Sigman, 1986; Colombo, 1993; Miller et al., 1980). This indicates that habituation provides important insight into early cognition as it relates to the development of more complex cognitive abilities later in childhood. [4]"

The  children  were  shown  one  of  the  objects  in  Figure until  they habituated to it (three consecutive trials in which the mean looking time to the stimulus was less than or equal to 50% of the mean looking  time  during  the  first  three  habituation  trials).  After  habituation,  the  infant  was  then  presented  with  randomized  trials containing  both  a  new  object  (not  shown  in  the  habituation  phase)  and  the  familiar  object  (shown  in  the  habituation  phase). Findings  revealed  that  deaf  infants  were  slower  to  habituate  to  and  demonstrated  a  lower  look-away  rate  than  hearing  infants. Evidence  from  prior  studies  suggests  that  the  'look-away'  rate-brief  eye  gaze  shifts  away  from  the  target  stimulus  during habituation-reflects processing efficiency and attentional control (Bahrick et al., 2016). One explanation for these results is that deaf infants' cognitive development may be protracted because of delayed language development (these deaf infants already had or were waiting to receive a cochlear implant and all of them had limited access to a fully-accessible language, like sign language). 8.3.2 [4]\nObject A\nObject B\nFigure : Examples of objects used in an infant habituation experiment.

    "context_enriched_content": "Milestones of Cognitive Development\nInfants and toddlers are constantly learning about the world as they experience it and actively engage with it during the first three years of life. Milestones represent what most children can do by specific ages; however, it is important to remember that children do not achieve these milestones at the same exact ages--milestones only represent the average age at when they are achieved. If a child has not achieved specific milestones by a specific age, it does not necessarily suggest a delay or disability; however, there are specific ages where if certain milestones are not achieved, caregivers should encourage the child's parents to communicate with their family pediatrician. Here is a table of some of the cognitive milestones infants and toddlers typically develop.\n2 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Pay attention to faces ● Begin to follow things with their eyes and recognize people at a distance ● Begin to act bored (cry, act fussy) if activity doesn't change. 4 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Let you know if they are happy or sad ● Respond to affection ● Reach for a toy with one hand ● Use their hands and eyes together, such as seeing a toy and reaching for it ● Follow moving things with their eyes from side to side ● Watch people's faces closely ● Recognize familiar people and things at a distance. 6 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Look around at things nearby ● Bring things to their mouth ● Show curiosity about things and try to get things that are out of reach ● Begin to pass things from one hand to the other. 9 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Watch the path of something as it falls ● Look for things they see you hide ● Play peek-a-boo ● Put things in their mouth ● Move things smoothly from one hand to the other ● Pick up things like cereal o's between thumb and index finger. 12 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Explore things in different ways, like shaking, banging and throwing ● Find hidden things easily ● Look at the right picture or thing when it's named ● Copy gestures ● Start to use things correctly; for example, drink from a cup, brush hair with a brush ● Bang two things together ● Put things in a container and take things out of a container ● Let things go without help ● Poke with index (pointer) finger ● Follow simple directions like 'pick up the toy'. 18 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Know what ordinary things are for; for example, telephone, brush, and spoon ● Point to get the attention of others ● Show interest in a doll or stuffed animal by pretending to feed them ● Point to one body part ● Scribble on their own ● Can follow 1-step verbal commands without any gestures; for example, sits when you say 'sit down'\nWhat most children can do at each age\n24 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Find things even when hidden under two or three covers ● Begin to sort shapes and colors ● Complete sentences and rhymes in familiar books ● Play simple make-believe games ● Build towers of 4 or more blocks ● Might use one hand more than the other ● Follow two-step instructions such as 'Pick up your shoes and put them in the closet.' ● Name items in a picture book such as a cat, bird, or dog. 36 months, What Most Children Can Do By Each Age [1] = ● Can work toys with buttons, levers, and moving parts ● Play make-believe with dolls, animals, and people ● Do puzzles with 3 or 4 pieces ● Understand what 'two' means ● Copy a circle with a pencil or crayon ● Turn book pages one at a time ● Build towers of more than 6 blocks ● Screw and unscrew jar lids or turn door handles\n[1]\nCDC's Developmental Milestones by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the public domain.\nThis page titled 8.4: Cognitive Milestones, 2-36 months is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

What about children who do not achieve these milestones by the ages listed? While children can indeed develop different abilities at different times, too great a delay in acquiring specific milestones can be a concern. The information in Figure# is from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The chart adopts a proactive stance--we should take action early when developmental concerns arise rather than the perspective of waiting to see if a child 'catches up'. Again, while children do develop at individual paces, being proactive during these critical early years is essential. The chart below lists milestones that, if children are not achieving by specific ages, caregivers should encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician. Most caregivers are not professionally trained to officially assess the developmental abilities of children; however, caregivers have the ability to track developmental progress and are often the first to notice developmental concerns.\nWhen to encourage parents to communicate with a pediatrician\nBy 4 months, Encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if: [1] = ● Child doesn't watch things as they move ● Child doesn't smile at people. By 6 months, Encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if: [1] = ● Child doesn't try to get things that are in reach ● Child shows no affection for caregivers ● Child has difficulty getting things to mouth ● Child doesn't respond to sounds around him ● Child doesn't laugh or make squealing sounds. By 9 months, Encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if: [1] = ● Child doesn't play any games involving back-and-forth play ● Child doesn't respond to own name ● Child doesn't seem to recognize familiar people ● Child doesn't look where you point ● Child doesn't transfer toys from one hand to the other. By 12 months, Encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if: [1] = ● Child doesn't search for things that she sees you hide ● Child doesn't say single words like 'mama' or 'dada' ● Child doesn't learn gestures like waving or shaking head ● Child doesn't point to things. By 18 months, Encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if: [1] = ● Child doesn't point to show things to others ● Child doesn't know what familiar things are for ● Child doesn't copy others ● Child doesn't gain new words ● Child doesn't have at least 6 words ● Child doesn't notice or mind when a caregiver leaves or returns ● Child loses skills he once had.

    "context_enriched_content": "Processes of Cognition\nImagine being an infant, what would learning about the world be like? From the sounds, sights and smells, there would be a lot of new things to try to make sense of! Indeed, the potential information available in the environment is both voluminous and complex. This led William James to coin his famous phrase about 'the blooming, buzzing confusion' that confronts the newborn (James, 1890). Contrary to what James thought, infants show remarkable feats of learning as they make sense of the world, beginning in the last  trimester  of  fetal  life  and  accelerating  through  infancy  and  toddlerhood. But how is it that infants are able to learn in such complex environments? Let's next discuss various cognitive processes during infancy and toddlerhood. [1]\nKidd et al., (2012).

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant Imitation\nImitation of others' behavior is considered a central means of learning, specifically for social cognition and the learning of cultural norms  (Goertz  et  al.,  2011;  Kugiumutzakis  &  Trevarthen,  2015;  Meltzoff  &  Marshall,  2018).  Imitation  has  been  defined  in numerous ways, emphasizing the matching of either the form of movements, the outcomes, or the intentions of an action. The often cited findings from Meltzoff and Moore (1977; 1983), that newborns imitate adult facial expressions, has been called into question. Recent research has been unable to replicate their findings and has pointed out critical weaknesses and limitations in those early newborn imitation studies (Kennedy-Costantini et al., 2017; Oostenbroek et al., 2016; Oostenbroek et al., 2018; Slaughter, 2021). [1]\nFigure : Infant imitating an adult sticking their tongue out. ( ) 8.6.1.1 [2]\nWhile newborn imitation continues to be debated, it is clear that imitation plays a role in learning for older infants and toddlers. It has been found that 12 to 18 month-olds learn one to two novel actions every day, merely by observing others around them (Barr & Hayne, 2003). Rather than imitating everything and everyone, however, infants tend to be selective in their imitative behavior, a tendency  that  is  present  beginning  around  12  months  of  age  (Schwier  et  al.,  2006;  Zmyj,  Daum  &  Aschersleben,  2009).  For example, in one study researchers presented a novel head action to two groups of 14-month-olds whereby the model illuminated a light-box with her forehead by sitting in a chair and leaning forward until her head pressed on the light-box (Gergely, Bekkering & Király, 2002). While one group of infants observed the unusual head action with the model freely resting her hands next to the light box (hands-free condition), the other group observed a demonstration of the identical head action, but the model had her hands occupied by holding a blanket wrapped around her torso (hands-occupied condition). Figure illustrates the two conditions. The majority (69%) of infants in the hands-free condition imitated this novel action of using their forehead to turn on the light-box, whereas only 21% of infants did so in the hands-occupied condition. The authors argued the results suggest that infants inferred that the model must have had good reasons to freely choose to perform the unusual action in the hands-free condition, whereas the model would have used her hands in the hands-occupied condition if she was not using her hands to hold the blanket. As a result, while imitation  can  be  a  great  way  to  learn,  the  imitation  process  for  infants  and  toddlers  is  complex  as  they  consider  various factors that may influence what actions of adults are rational or logical before imitating. 8.6.1.2 [3] [4]\nFigure :Images of the two conditions in the light-box experiment.

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant Imitation\nAs imitation is one way infants and toddlers learn about the world, caregivers can support cognitive development through imitation by including infants and toddlers in everyday care routines and by demonstrating more complex actions during play and social interactions.  Care  routines  (e.g.,  diapering,  meal  time,  etc.,)  can  sometimes  become  more  like  adult-driven  chores  if  caregivers quickly rush through with the goal of completion. However, care routines often involve complex actions that can be rich learning opportunities  for  young  children  to  watch,  imitate  and  learn  from.  For  example,  the  care  routine  of  meal  time  involves  motor movements to support pouring, scooping, holding, passing, etc., and also involves the learning of social patterns such as waiting, turn taking, manners etc.,. These motor actions and social patterns may be challenging for young toddlers, but are important as they practice these skills and are able to participate more in the meal time routine. Instead of preparing individual plates ahead of time and out of the sight of the children, plates can be prepared and shared in their presence. A family-style meal presentation where food and drinks are served at the table with toddlers, allows for them to be able to watch, imitate and learn from the meal time routine. Additionally, during play and social interactions, caregivers who are engaged with infants and toddlers and demonstrate different ways to use and play with materials encourage infants and toddlers to imitate similar actions as they learn about how the world works.\n- Paukner  et  al.,  (2017).

    "context_enriched_content": "Concept of Categorization\nInfants  and  toddlers  are  constantly  experiencing  new  and  recurring  objects  and  events.  The  ability  to  form  categories  is  a  core cognitive  ability  that  helps  organize  these  experiences.  Without  categorization,  we  would  treat  every  entity  we  encounter  (e.g., every golden retriever) as unique. Identifying a category to which an object or entity belongs (e.g., a dog, a retriever) permits us to make  inferences  that  go  beyond  our  immediate  experience  with  that  entity  (e.g.,  retrievers  bark,  have  sharp  teeth,  etc.). Categorization, therefore, is  a  fundamental  cognitive  process,  and  one  that  is  especially  important  for  infants  and  toddlers  who encounter new objects, entities, and events every day. [1] [2]\nFigure : Infant with different categories of objects. ( ) 8.6.2.1 [3]\nA considerable body of research reveals that in the first months of life, infants can already successfully and spontaneously form object categories of animals, vehicles, and geometric shapes (Balaban & Waxman, 1997; Novack et al., 2021; Quinn, Eimas & Tarr, 2001). For example, Figure shows a sample of stimuli used in a categorization experiment with 3 to 4 month old infants (Ferry, Hespos & Waxman, 2010). In the familiarization phase, infants were shown various types of dinosaurs, varying in color. In the test phase, infants saw two objects in the same color, one dinosaur (familized object) and one non-dinosaur object not shown in the  familiarization  phase  (novel  object).  To  measure  categorization,  infants'  looking  time  at  the  objects  in  the  test  phase  was measured. The results demonstrate that already by 3 to 4 months of age, infants are cognitively forming categories of objects they encounter. 8.6.2.2 [1] [2]\nFigure : Example stimuli from infant categorization research. ( ) 8.6.2.2 [4]\nBy  12  months,  however,  infants  reach  a  turning  point  where  what  matters  is  not  whether  infants  are  listening  to  language  in general, but more precisely, what is being said about specific objects. By 12 months, infants track not only which objects and which words are presented, but also how the words and objects are paired together (Waxman & Braun, 2005). Specifically, when infants hear  the  same  label  with  each  object,  the  labels  highlight  commonalities  between  them  and  thus  facilitate  their  categorization, whereas  when  infants  hear  a  distinct  label  for  each  object,  the  labels  highlight  their  differences  and  thus  facilitate  their individuation (Dewar & Xu, 2007; Xu, Cote & Baker, 2005). [5]\nThe research on categorization suggests that young infants begin categorizing objects by 3 to 4 months of age and that language promotes  categorization.  Therefore  caregivers  can  support  categorization  through  learning  experiences  and  language  use.  With learning  experiences,  caregivers  can  provide  play  objects  and  manipulatives  where  similarities  and  differences  can  be  easily\nidentified through color, size, texture and shape. Objects within and across categorical boundaries are also important. For example, objects of one type of animal such as fish can be provided alongside another type of animal, such as birds. This can help children identify commonalities within the category of fish and differences across the categories of fish and birds. To promote categorization with  language,  caregivers  can  be  purposeful  with  the  language  they  use  by  labeling  objects  within  and  across  categories  and highlighting  similarities  and  differences  between  objects.  Figure shows  a  toddler  holding  three  leaves.  Each  leaf  is  a different color, size and shape. As a caregiver, what words or phrases could you use to support a toddler's categorization process when playing with these leaves? 8.6.2.3\nFigure : Categorization of Leaves. ( ) 8.6.2.3 [6]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding Numbers\nEvidence suggests that there is an innate, non-symbolic sense of quantity that gives rise to our basic numerical intuitions. The Approximate Number System (ANS) allows humans and non-human animals to estimate quantities without explicitly counting. For example, if you look at the two images in Figure ,  which image has more dots than the other? Can you figure it out by simply looking at the two images--without counting any of the dots? While this example is slightly challenging because the number of  dots  in  the  two  images  is  similar,  in  experiments  like  this,  using  dots,  infants  have  the  innate  ability  to  distinguish  between various quantities. 8.6.3.1 [1]\nFigure : The Approximate Number System Test. ( ) 8.6.3.1 [2]\nThe ANS is present at birth as newborns are able to discriminate object sets if the ratio is at least 1:3 (e.g., arrays of 4 vs.12 dots) (Izard et al., 2009). The ability to discriminate between displays of large numbers, known as number acuity (efficiency), improves throughout childhood (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008) with dramatic changes in number acuity observed within the first year of life. In a visual only comparison, four month olds can discriminate between a 1:4 ratio but not a change to a 1:3 ratio; however, if audio and visual information are both provided, four month olds can discriminate between a 1:3 ratio, but not a change to a 1:2 ratio (Wang & Feigenson, 2021). Six-month-old infants can reliably discriminate between sets with a ratio of 1:2 (e.g., arrays of 8 vs.16 dots) but cannot discriminate between sets with a 2:3 ratio (e.g., arrays of 8 vs.12 dots) (Feigenson, 2011; Xu & Spelke, 2000). By about 9 to 10 months of age, infants are able to discriminate 2:3 ratios (e.g., arrays of 8 vs. 12 dots) but fail with 4:5 ratios (e.g., arrays of 8 vs.10 dots) (Lipton & Spelke, 2003; Xu & Arriaga, 2007; Xu & Spelke, 2000). [3]\nFigure :  Number acuity: 6 month olds can discriminate between sets with a ratio of 1:2 (e.g., arrays of 8 vs.16 dots) but cannot discriminate between sets with a 2:3 ratio (e.g., arrays of 8 vs.12 dots). ( ) 8.6.3.2 [4]\nNumber acuity  in  infancy  is  related  to  later  mathematical  performance  throughout  childhood,  adolescence  and  the  adult  years (Halberda et al., 2008; Mazzocco, Feigenson & Halberda, 2011; Libertus, Feigenson & Halberda, 2013; Starr, Libertus & Brannon, 2013). To illustrate, one study (Starr, Libertus & Brannon, 2013) placed two monitors in front of six month olds. One monitor always displayed the same number of dots (although the dots changed, varying in placement array) and the other monitor changed between various numbers of dots and placement array. Some infants spent more time looking at the monitor that displayed the changing numbers of dots than other infants. The researchers then followed the same children into preschool where they measured\nvarious math abilities. Results showed that the infants who spent more time looking at the monitor that displayed the changing numbers of dots had greater mathematical skills as preschoolers.\nWhile early number acuity may be inborn, other numerical abilities are not and develop overtime. Children come to understand the meaning of exact number words very slowly (Wynn, 1990, 1992). English-speaking children first learn the meaning of the word 'one' around two-and-a-half years of age but lack knowledge of numbers larger than one. About four to five months after learning the meaning of 'one,' children understand the word 'two' but not larger numbers, such as 'three' or 'four.' It takes several more months for children to display knowledge of the word 'three.' Not until children are three or four years of age do they fully grasp the cardinality principle-that each number word refers only to an exact set of that quantity with the last number in the count list referring to the total number of items in the set (Carey, 2009).

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding Numbers\nBefore infants and toddlers may fully understand the meaning of specific number words, they show an early sensitivity to counting. Eighteen-month-old infants showed a preference for correctly ordered counting sequences; that is, although they were unable to recite the count list themselves, they recognized and preferred to listen to the correct order of the number words (Ip et al., 2018). Similarly, 14 to 18 month-old infants appear to be able to use their ability to recognize the count list to help them overcome typical memory limits (Wang & Feigenson, 2019). Infants generally display working memory capacity limits of three items and fail to remember the number of hidden items when it exceeds this limit (Feigenson & Carey, 2003). However, when objects are counted before being hidden, infants are able to overcome this memory limit (Wang & Feigenson, 2019). Thus, even though toddlers may not grasp the full meaning of number words, they may still be aware of the numerical nature of these words and may be able to use counting knowledge despite lacking precise representations of the quantities.\nFigure : CNumbered stepping stones. ( ) 8.6.3.4 [7]\nAlthough  research  suggests  ANS  to  be  innate,  ANS  is  only  an  early  foundation  to  support  mathematical  development.  As mathematical  knowledge  continues  to  develop,  caregivers  play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  it.  Infants  and  toddlers  build  early foundations  for  math  during  play  and  daily  care  routines.  Young  children  naturally  explore  math  concepts  as  they  play,  and caregivers support their math knowledge and vocabulary with the language they use. Caregivers can use math talk during care routines by discussing spatial concepts like, 'I'm going to pick you up' or  they can compare the size of their shoes as they get ready to go outside, 'Your shoes are smaller than my shoes.' Caregivers can use math language during mealtimes: 'How many\nblueberries do you have left? Do you need more?' The more math language children hear each day, the greater the growth of their math knowledge. [8]\nAdditionally, infants and toddlers need time and space to play in open-ended ways with varied materials to boost their emerging math skills. Caregivers can introduce math concepts like size and shape, and spatial words like in, between, and under during any type  of  play  or  routine.  Create  and  look  for  patterns  in  the  environment  and  point  them  out  to  children.  Find  patterns  in  your clothing or around the environment like stripes on a rug and point them out to children while using math language to describe the patterns.  Indoor  and  outdoor  environments  present  unlimited  ways  that  we  can  discuss  math.  When  working  with  infants  and toddlers, purposefully look around the environment and at the materials being used for math concepts you can discuss. [8]\n- Ma et al., (2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Purpose of Executive Functions\nExecutive  functions  are  a  complex  set  of  cognitive  abilities,  which  enable  us  to  coordinate  mental  processes,  manipulate information, solve new problems, sequence information, inhibit non-useful responses and generate new strategies to accomplish goals  in  a  flexible  way  (Diamond,  2012;  Henry,  Messer,  &  Nash,  2012;  Miyake  &  Friedman,  2012).  Most  executive  function research focuses on three core areas: inhibition; working memory and cognitive flexibility, which some suggest underpin other more complex executive functions such as planning, problem solving, reasoning, etc., (Friedman & Miyake, 2017). [1]\nExecutive functions play an important role in the everyday life of infants and toddlers, allowing them to focus attention on specific tasks,  to  engage  in  successful  problem  solving,  and  to  plan  for  their  next  action.  Executive  functions  begin  to  emerge  early  in infancy, with basic skills needed for executive functions emerging before three years of age, and more specific skills developing in early childhood (Garon, Bryson & Smith, 2008). It has been suggested that each component of executive function develops at its own  rate  across  childhood  and  adolescence,  reaching  maturity  at  different  ages  (Diamond,  2013).  The  gradual  acquisition  of executive functions relate to the development of the prefrontal cortex and other brain areas from infancy to adulthood (Fiske & Holmboe, 2019; Thompson, 2016; Tsujimoto, 2008). [2] [3]\nFigure depicts the growth of executive function abilities in infants and toddlers from 9 to 30 months of age (Hendry & Holmboe, 2021). This data highlights two important findings. First, executive function abilities  improve  with  age,  a  consistent finding across studies (Hendry et al., 2016; Putnam et al., 2006). As Figure shows, there is a steady increase in executive function skill across the first thirty months. Second, there are early individual differences already evident by the end of the first year.  This  means  that  at  any  given  age,  some  infants  and  toddlers  have  greater  executive  function  abilities  than  others. Understanding early differences could be important as preschool and kindergarten children's performance on executive function tests is correlated with academic achievement (for both mathematical and literacy assessments) in the U.S., South Korea, Taiwan, and China (McClelland et al., 2014; Ponitz et al., 2009; Wanless et al., 2011). 8.6.4.1 8.6.4.1 [4]\nFigure : Cognitive Executive Function (CEF) scores by age.

    "context_enriched_content": "Inhibition\nInhibition,  or  inhibitory  control,  is  a  child's  ability  to  stop  a  dominant  response  and  demonstrate  more  adaptive  and/or  socially acceptable  behavior  (Diamond,  Kirkham,  &  Amso,  2002;  Rennie,  Bull,  &  Diamond,  2004).  Inhibition  is  important  in  the successful execution of tasks by providing the child with the flexibility and freedom to choose and control their actions (Dowsett & Livesey, 2000), for instance, by waiting for one's turn, sharing or cleaning up toys before playing somewhere else. [6]\nThe developmental trajectory of inhibition begins towards the end of the first year of life (Diamond, 2002, Diamond et al., 2007, Garon et al., 2008, Wolfe & Bell, 2007) with research suggesting that some early forms of inhibitory and attentional control emerge already at around 6 months of age (Courage, Reynolds, & Richards, 2006; Holmboe, Bonneville-Roussy, et al., 2018). Inhibition\nskills  develop  rapidly  between  the  ages  of  22  and  33 months  (Carlson,  2005;  Kochanska,  Murray,  &  Harlan,  2000),  and  the proportion of time children can successfully wait improves significantly between the ages of 30 and 42 months (Caughy, Mills, Owen, & Hurst, 2013). Following this, inhibition shows a rapid improvement during the toddler and preschool years (Friedman et al., 2011, Garon et al., 2008, Garon et al., 2014, Holmboe, Larkman, et al., 2018, Simpson & Riggs, 2005), increasing at a more steady pace throughout middle childhood (Best & Miller, 2010, Best et al., 2009), before eventually reaching adult levels in early adolescence (van den Wildenberg & van der Molen, 2004, Williams et al., 1999). [6] [7]\nAs infants and toddlers grow, caregiver-child interactions have an important impact on the development of children's inhibition skills.  Well-organized infant and toddler classroom environments and caregivers' use of clear, proactive strategies in supporting behavior create predictability within the classroom that further enables the child to gain a sense of control and exhibit appropriate behavior while inhibiting more inappropriate behaviors (Salminen et al., 2021). Children's ability to show better inhibition control in  classrooms  also  relates  to  the  caregivers'  sensitivity  and  responsiveness  towards  children's  needs  and  developing  skills. Children's feelings of frustration can be reduced by creating a safe and welcoming environment, showing interest in supporting infants' and toddlers' autonomy, understanding their way of seeing the world, and supporting their willingness to attend to learning activities  in  a  personally  meaningful  way  (Hamre  &  Pianta,  2005;  Ladd,  Birch,  &  Buhs,  1999).  These  caregiver  practices  of sensitivity  and  responsiveness  may  further  indicate  to  children  that  their  own  actions  and  decisions  matter,  hence  sending  out stronger signals of how to behave in an acceptable way.

    "context_enriched_content": "Inhibition\nThe concept of caregiver mind-mindedness is related to (but distinct from) that of sensitivity, but is also related to the development of inhibition. Mind-mindedness refers to a caregiver's proclivity to treat an infant as an 'individual with a mind rather than merely as a [child] with needs that must be satisfied' (Meins, Fernyhough, Fradley & Tuckey, 2001). For example, if, during a game of peek-a-boo, the infant signals that they are overstimulated (e.g., by turning away from the caregiver, tuning out, frantic movements, etc.),  the  caregiver's  appropriate  understanding  of  the  behavioral  signal  in  terms  of  the  child's  internal  states  (e.g.,  feeling overwhelmed) is critical in guiding the caregiver's reaction. When the caregiver accurately understands the signal, they are more likely to show an attuned response: pause the game, enabling the infant's autonomic system to recover from the heightened arousal. Conversely, when the caregiver does not have a mind-minded perspective, they may not see or may misinterpret the infant's signal and are more likely to continue the peekaboo game. The infant then does not experience recovery from heightened physiological arousal in a way that is matched to his or her current state of being. [8] [9] [10]\nOne way to know a caregiver's level of mind-mindedness is to measure the proportion of attuned comments in which a caregiver refers  to  a  child's  desires,  cognitions  and  emotions  (Meins,  Fernyhough,  Fradley  &  Tuckey,  2001).  Despite  only  about  10%  of caregiver  verbal  comments  being  mind-mindedness  comments  that  accurately  reflect  the  child's  internal  state  (Helmerhorst, Colonnesi & Fukkink, 2019), caregiver mind-mindedness of infants at nine months of age predicts children's developing inhibitory control at 2 and 3 years of age (  Cheng, Lu, Archer & Wang, 2018). There are cultural differences in the level of mind-mindedness of caregivers. Mind-mindedness was lower in Chinese and Hong Kong caregivers compared to caregivers in the U.K. and Canada (Bernier, Carlson & Whipple, 2010; Hughes, Devine & Wang, 2017). [8] [9]"

For a toddler, this can be seen in completing a task with two parts (e.g., 'take your paintbrush to the sink and wash your hands') or remembering simple rules in a game or in play. The basic components of working memory start to develop across the child's first year of life, while more complex working memory abilities, such as updating or manipulating representations develop during toddlerhood and throughout the preschool period (Alloway, Gathercole, Willis, & Adams, 2004; Gathercole, 1998; Pelphrey & Reznick, 2002).

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Flexibility\nCognitive flexibility, the ability to shift between different tasks or goals, is considered a key aspect of executive functions, allowing individuals to regulate their thoughts and actions adaptively Jurado & Rosselli, 2007; Miyake et al., 2000). Cognitive flexibility is sometimes  also  referred  to  by  shifting,  attention  switching,  or  task  switching,  and  includes  both  the  ability  to  disengage  from irrelevant  information  in  a  previous  task  and  to  focus  on  relevant  information  in  a  forthcoming  task  (Monsell,  2003).  Thus, cognitive flexibility enables one to think divergently, change perspective and adapt to a continuously changing environment. [11]\nThere is sparse research on the development of cognitive flexibility in infants and toddlers, as most research finds even 3 year olds struggle  on  tasks  of  cognitive  flexibility.  The  Dimensional  Change  Card  Sorting  (DCCS)  task  is  widely  used  to  measure  the cognitive flexibility of children. The DCCS task asks children to sort cards (e.g., a red rabbit and a blue boat) with one of the two\ntarget cards (e.g., a red boat and a blue rabbit) according to one rule (e.g., by color), and then after several successful trials, switch to another rule (e.g., by shape). Previous findings using the DCCS task indicated that most 3-year olds had difficulty switching between the dimensions, but by age 4, most children could successfully switch to the new rule (Perner & Lang, 2002; Zelazo, Frye & Rapus, 1996). Cognitive flexibility matures along a steep slope during early childhood (Diamond, 2006; Garon et al., 2008) and this is thought to be driven by neurodevelopmental changes in the prefrontal cortex (Diamond, 2002; Ezekiel et al., 2013). [12]\nMatching based on shape\nFigure : Examples from a Dimensional Change Card Sorting (DCCS) task. ( ) 8.6.4.2 [12]\nThere are important cultural differences in early executive function skills. Findings from cross-cultural investigations suggest that children from Eastern cultures (e.g., Chinese) typically perform better on executive function tasks than their Western counterparts (Sabbagh et al., 2006; Oh & Lewis, 2008; Lewis et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2011; Grabell et al., 2015). Different explanations have been  proposed.  While  children  from  Eastern  cultures  are  expected  to  have  mastery  of  impulse  control  around  2  years  of  age, children from Western cultures are not expected to be able to do so until the preschool years (Chen et al., 1998). This could create opportunities for Chinese children to be taught the importance of self-control (Ellefson et al., 2017) and start practicing executive function skills at an earlier age than their U.S. counterparts (Sabbagh et al., 2006). In a collectivist culture like China, children practice and learn how to behave in society through adult modeling of the 'acceptable' behaviors (Jian, 2009). On the other hand, individual choices and negotiation are valued elements in caregiving practices in individualistic cultures (Greenfield et al., 2006). According to Lan and colleagues (2011), the difference of educational styles between countries (e.g., China and the U.S.) is the major reason for the variation in executive function skills. While being able to control one's behavior, attention and concentration are a central element of Chinese education, self-expression and decision-making freedom are more of the focus in U.S. education (Song & Jinyu, 2016). [13]\nThe  overall  behaviors  and  practices  of  infant  and  toddler  caregivers  have  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of  executive functions (Bernier, Carlson & Whipple, 2010; Fay-Stammbach, Hawes & Meredith, 2014). Stephanie Carlson (2003) argued that caregiving contributes to the development of executive function through three primary aspects of interaction (scaffolding behavior, stimulation, and sensitivity) and that each has different effects on executive function."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Flexibility\nScaffolding refers  to  how  caregivers  verbally  and  non-verbally  guide  and  instruct  children  during  challenging  tasks  (Lewis  & Carpendale, 2009), support children's autonomous exploration, and encourage children to make decisions autonomously to solve problems (Matte-Gagn & Bernier, 2011). For example, a caregiver might provide gentle guidance to a child frustrated by an evercollapsing block tower by placing the larger blocks at the base. The strategies provided by caregivers tell children not only what to do, but also ways to think, guiding improvements in cognitive control, inhibition and the ability to think flexibly during problemsolving.\nSensitivity represents  a  caregiver's  ability  to  perceive  and  accurately  interpret  the  signals  shown  explicitly  or  implicitly  in  an infant's  behavior,  and  to  then  respond  appropriately  (Pederson  et  al.,  1990).  Children  who  experience  their  environments  as predictable and consistent are inclined to achieve higher-level self-regulation in their early lives and are more motivated to gain cognitive control (Carlson, 2003). For example, caregiver-toddler interactions that are warm and responsive predict longitudinal effortful control performance and delay of gratification (inhibition) ability (Kochanska et al., 2000; Sethi et al., 2000).\nStimulation covers  the  wide  range  of  interactions  between  caregivers  and  children,  such  as  the  creation  of  environments  for cognitive skill development through activities like reading (Bradley et al., 2011) and playing together (Rome-Flanders, Cronk & Gourde,  1995).  Caregiver  language  has  specifically  been  found  to  play  a  critical  role  in  children's  later  executive  processing\n(Daneri  et  al.,  2019;  Landry  et  al.,  2002).  For  example,  caregiver  verbal  scaffolding  during  problem-solving  tasks  shows  both concurrent and longitudinal associations with executive function in early childhood (Bernier et al., 2010; Hammond et al., 2012; Hughes & Ensor, 2009). This research emphasizes the importance of developmentally-appropriate activities that also challenge infants and toddlers accompanied by sensitive scaffolding by caregivers.

    "context_enriched_content": "Development of Self-Regulation\nInfants have the ability to express themselves through vocalizations, facial expressions and movements of their body. For example, upon hearing a loud unexpected sound, an infant may close their eyes, tense their body and cry to express their internal state. However,  while  they  can  express  themselves,  infants  have  limited  capacity  for  self-regulation.  Self-regulation  is  the  ability  to control  behavior  and  responses  in  adaptive  ways  across  a  variety  of  dimensions,  including  attention,  emotion,  behavior,  and cognition  (Calkins,  2007;  Calkins  &  Fox,  2002).  Self-regulation  is  a  cornerstone  of  healthy  development  (Robson,  Allen  & Howard, 2020; Thompson, 2016) and has been linked to the development of language, mathematics, reading, and literacy skills (von  Salisch  et  al.,  2015;  Bohlman  &  Downer,  2016;  Lin  et  al.,  2016).  Consider  the  strategies  you  personally  use  for  selfregulation. When you feel scared, anxious, unmotivated or distracted, what strategies have you discovered that help you regulate your internal state?\n[1]\nFigure : Caregiver helping a child self-regulate ( 8.6.5.1\nDuring  infancy,  the  early  beginning  of  self-regulation  can  be  seen  in  infants'  responses  to  input  from  caregivers  and  the environment (Samdan et al., 2020). The ongoing development of motor skills, attention, and emotion subsequently influence the development of self-regulation abilities (Calkins, 2007), as infants and toddlers begin to recruit newly developed skills for selfregulating. Whereas a young infant relies upon the caregiver to distract them from an unfavorable experience, an older infant can control their eyes and/or head to purposefully look away and a toddler can use newly developed motor abilities to independently crawl or walk away. [2]\nIt is important to recognize that processes of self-regulation might differ across cultures (Jaramillo et al., 2017). The strategies an individual uses to modify their internal states and behaviors are immersed in a cultural context that gives priority to prevailing values and outcomes in the socialization process. In this way, caregivers shape an infant's developing self-regulation skills and at the same time communicate culturally-appropriate socioemotional norms and expectations. As an example, two studies (Harwood et  al.,  1999;  Carlson  and  Harwood,  2003)  compared  socialization  goals  and  practices  of  European  American  and  Puerto  Rican toddler caregivers. In line with their socialization goals, European American caregivers preferred educational practices that gave children  learning  opportunities.  They  structured  learning  situations  indirectly,  as  they  used  suggestions  and  verbal  approvals  to guide children to act in a certain way, while giving them much room to choose for themselves what to exactly do. Puerto Rican caregivers,  instead,  tended  to  use  more  authority  to  teach  children  the  ways  of  acting,  according  to  what  they  expected.  They intervened  physically  more  often  (e.g.,  by  physically  moving  children  to  do  something),  used  more  explicit  signals  to  obtain children's attention, and gave more direct orders than European American caregivers. [3]\nCaregivers are instrumental in the development and maintenance of self-regulatory abilities among infants and toddlers. As they develop, infants transition  from  dependence on caregivers for help in self-regulating to more autonomous self-regulation. Let's return  to  and  provide  more  information  about  the  scenario  of  the  infant  who  hears  a  loud  unexpected  sound  presented  at  the beginning of  this  topic.  Eli,  3  months  old,  is  a  new  child  in  the  infant  room  at  a  child  care  center.  Ms.  Williams,  his  primary caregiver, learned from his family what techniques work best to calm Eli when he is upset. One day, a loud noise from the street suddenly wakes Eli and he starts to cry. Ms. Williams lifts him from his crib and holds him close, swaying from side to side until he relaxes and returns to sleep. [4] [5]"

But when these tasks become challenging, what determines when a toddler will give up or demonstrate persistence? Persistence in childhood has repeatedly been associated  with  positive  outcomes.  Persistence  at  6  months  predicts  cognitive  development  at  14  months  (Banerjee  & TamisLeMonda,  2007),  persistence  at  3  years  predicts  language  and  math  skills  in  kindergarten  (Mokrova  et  al.,  2013),  and persistence  in  childhood  predicts  later  academic  achievement  (Meier  &  Albrecht,  2003),  success  at  career  work,  and  healthy relationships, well into adulthood (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, & Kelly, 2007; EskreisWinkler, Duckworth, Shulman, & Beal, 2014). [1]\nFigure : Persisting in a difficult task. ( ) 8.6.6.1 [2]\nDuring challenging tasks, we consider the costs and rewards for continued persistence. Recent work has provided evidence that young children also consider costs and rewards when making decisions. For example, 18-month-olds weigh the expected costs and benefits  of  their  actions  when  deciding  whether  to  help  an  adult  construct  a  tower  composed  of  blocks  of  different  weights (Sommerville et al.,  2018).  When  toddlers  were  presented  with  a  task  researchers  purposefully  created  to  be  impossible  to  do, increased  failure  led  to  decreased  effort  by  toddlers  (Radovanovic  et  al.,  2021).  Interestingly,  toddlers  who  attempted  various strategies  during  the  impossible  task  persisted  for  longer  in  trying  to  do  it.  This  research  emphasizes  the  importance  of developmentally-appropriate activities for infants and toddlers as well as the importance for caregivers to demonstrate different approaches to solve challenges. [1]\nOne factor that influences even very young children's decisions about when to persist and when to give up is the behavior of the adults in their environment (Kamins & Dweck, 1999; Lucca, Horton & Sommerville, 2019). For example, toddlers tend to make generalizations  about  when  to  persist  based  on  adult  behavior.  When  15-month-olds  observed  an  adult  work  hard  to  achieve  a particular goal (e.g. trying different strategies, repeating actions), they themselves attempted to activate a novel toy more times than toddlers  who  observed  an  adult  succeed  after  little  to  no  effort  (Leonard,  Lee  &  Schulz,  2017).  Thus,  our  persistence  with challenging tasks as caregivers, are demonstrations for infants and toddlers to learn about persistence themselves. [1]\nRett & Walker (2020).

Spatial abilities are an important part of cognitive development because early spatial skills are associated with map use (Liben et al., 2013), numerical skills (Zhang, 2016; Cornu et al., 2018; Fanari et al., 2019), math reasoning and knowledge (Casey et al., 2015; Rittle-Johnson et al., 2019), early writing skills (Bourke et al., 2014), motor skills (Jansen & Heil, 2010), and executive functions (Lehmann et al., 2014; Frick and Baumeler, 2017).

Mental rotation refers to the ability to imagine how an object that has been seen from one perspective would look if it were rotated in space into a new orientation and viewed from the new perspective. This ability is crucial even for infants because from soon after birth they are confronted with and must cognitively represent moving and rotating objects in their natural environment. Whether a caregiver or a favorite toy, infants must learn how to recognize people and objects when viewed from different orientations.

At the top is an image of a 'same' stimulus in which the object on the right is the same as the object on the left, just  rotated.  At  the  bottom  is  an  image  of  a  'different'  stimulus,  no  matter  how  the  image  on  the  left  is  rotated,  it  cannot  be represented by the image on the right. 8.6.7.2 [3] [4] [5]\nFigure : Example of a mental rotation test item. ( ) 8.6.7.2 [6]\nSeveral studies have reported mental rotation abilities in infants as young as 3 to 5 months of age with greater abilities in boys than in girls in early infancy (Constantinescu et al., 2018; Johnson & Moore, 2020; Lauer et al., 2015; Quinn & Liben, 2014). As an example, Moore and Johnson (2008) habituated three month old infants to a video of an object, like in Figure , as it rotated around its vertical axis. Then, in test trials, infants saw the same object (just rotated) or a different object (its mirror image). In 8.6.7.3\nFigure image A represents the 'back side' of the habituation object seen in Figure (thus it is the same image, just rotated). In Figure image B represents the mirror-image of the object seen in image A. The results of the study revealed that only the boys, not the girls, differentiated between the same and the mirror object. Thus, mental rotation is developed already by three months of age, with a gender difference favoring males in the ability to mentally rotate an object in three-dimensional space. 8.6.7.4 8.6.7.4 8.6.7.4 [7]\nFigure : 3 dimensional geometric object. (Copyright; author via source) 8.6.7.3\nFigure : 3 dimensional geometric objects. (Copyright; author via source) 8.6.7.4\nStudies suggest there are various factors that might be important for supporting the early development of mental rotation abilities. Campos et al. (2000) provided evidence that self-produced locomotion, such as crawling, is relevant for infant visual-cognitive ability in general, while other studies have demonstrated a specific association between infant crawling and mental rotation ability (Gerhard-Samunda, Jovanovic & Schwarzer, 2021; Schwarzer et al., 2012). In addition, manual object exploration, such as when infants  and  toddlers  use  their  hands  to  manipulate,  rotate  and  transfer  objects,  might  be  associated  with  infant  mental  rotation ability (Möhring & Frick, 2013; (Soska et al., 2010). These findings demonstrate a relation between mental rotation abilities in infants and toddlers and object and environment exploration. Caregivers can support the development of mental rotation abilities by encouraging infants and toddlers to directly explore objects of various sizes, shapes, colors, etc, with their hands and by supporting the exploration of mobile children.

    "context_enriched_content": "Effect of Praise on Mindset\nAs a student, what were your favorite and least favorite classes in school? For many people, their least favorite class was math and they might say statements like 'I'm just not a math person'. This statement suggests that people are born with specific abilities (like being skilled at math or art, or sports, etc.,). The problem with this statement is that we are not born to be or to not be 'math people'. While indeed genetics and environment play a role in developing abilities, so too does the mindset we have.\nMindsets are defined as implicit beliefs individuals hold about basic human abilities and attributes, such as intelligence (Dweck, 2006).  They  exist  on  a  spectrum  from  fixed  mindsets,  which  refer  to  believing  that  specific  human  attributes  are  static  and unchangeable, to growth mindsets, which refer to believing that these attributes are malleable and can be shaped and developed with effort. So if we return back to math, someone who says 'I'm just not a math person' probably has a fixed mindset because they  are  suggesting  human  abilities  are  unchangeable-you  are  either  born  a  math  person  or  not.  In  contrast,  someone  with  a growth mindset can still struggle with math, but believes that their ability in math can be changed-practicing more and finding new strategies can help them improve. [1]\nThe role of mindsets has been widely investigated in the educational field, especially with older children, as mindsets are related to motivation and behavior, including the way students handle academic setbacks and challenges (Blackwell, Trzesniewski & Dweck, 2007; Aditomo, 2015). People with a fixed mindset are more prone to interpret their setbacks to a lack of inborn ability when compared to people with a growth mindset, who instead attribute setbacks to a lack of effort (Dweck, Chiu & Hong, 1995; Dweck, 2006). Growth mindset has been linked to students' higher resilience, psychological well being, and school engagement (Yeager et al., 2019; Zeng, Hou & Peng, 2016). [1]\nWhy do some people have a growth mindset while others have a fixed mindset? What factors contribute to someone developing a specific mindset? As infants and toddlers develop, they frequently reveal new abilities that are exciting for caregivers to witness. Praise is a common response to these new abilities. While praise may seem like a positive response, research has revealed that the effect of praise depends on the type of praise, and that, surprisingly, some types of praise negatively affect the motivation of the person  receiving  praise.  Many  studies  have  found  that  receiving  effort-focused  praise  positively  affected  motivation,  while receiving  ability-focused  praise  negatively  affected  motivation  (e.g.,  Brummelman  et  al.,  2014;  Mueller  &  Dweck,  1998).  In  a landmark study by Mueller and Dweck (1998), fifth-grade children were asked to work on a set of tasks; then, they were praised for their  ability  (e.g.,  'You  must  be  smart'),  were  praised  for  their  effort  (e.g.,  'You  must  have  worked  hard'),  or  received  no additional  feedback  (i.e.,  the  control  group).  Subsequently,  children  were  given  a  more  difficult  set  of  problems  and  failed. Compared to children in the control group, children in the effort praise group reported more task enjoyment and performed higher on the subsequent task, while children in the ability praise group reported less task enjoyment and performed lower on the task. [2]\nThese effects of ability-focused and effort-focused praise are related to one's mindset about one's ability and attributes (e.g., Gunderson et al., 2013; Pomerantz & Kempner, 2013). Children who receive effort-focused praise tend to endorse a growth mindset, and their enjoyment and subsequent task performance are high following failure; in contrast, those who receive ability-focused  praise  tend  to  endorse  a  fixed  mindset,  and  their  enjoyment  and  subsequent  task  performance  are  low following failure (Dweck, 2008; Mueller and Dweck, 1998). Effort-focused praise emphasizes the fundamental role of effort for  growth/improvement,  whereas  ability-focused  praise  implies  that  individuals'  intelligence  is  an  internal  and  perhaps fixed/stable trait.

    "context_enriched_content": "Effect of Praise on Mindset\nResearch with infants and toddlers demonstrates that mindsets about one's abilities are already forming during the first three years of life and the type of praise received from caregivers is important in shaping a child's mindset. Eighteen month old toddlers who have caregivers who use more effort-focused praise are more persistent in challenging tasks (Lucca, Horton & Sommerville, 2019). Toddlers who receive more ability-focused praise from their caregivers are more likely to have a growth mindset later in childhood as 7 to 8 year olds (Gunderson et al., 2013) and higher academic achievement in the fourth grade (Gunderson et al., 2018).\nAs caregivers of infants and toddlers, we not only need to be cognizant of how our praise affects childrens' developing mindsets, but also the impact our personal mindsets can have. Recent research has focused on caregivers' mindsets as a key factor that may shape caregiving behaviors and perspectives toward children (Justice et al., 2020). Caregivers' mindsets refers to the beliefs that caregivers hold regarding whether children's development is fixed or malleable as well as their belief of the importance of effort for learning (Sisk et al., 2018). [3]\nRecently,  Rowe  and  Leech  (2018)  implemented  a  random-assignment  experiment  to  examine  use  of  a  caregiver  mindset intervention to improve caregivers' non-verbal interactions with 10-month-old infants. Caregivers assigned to a training condition participated in training emphasizing the malleability of early language skills and that caregivers can play a key role in facilitating these  skills  through  non-verbal  interactions.  Compared  to  caregivers  in  a  control  group,  the  trained  caregivers  interacted  more frequently with their children at 12 months of age, and this effect was particularly strong for caregivers who originally had a fixed mindset.  Such  research  suggests  that  caregiver  mindset  may  be  a  key  factor  for  improving  children's  early  experiences  and development. To discover what your mindset is, (\\PageIndex{1}\\) presents a short Mindset assessment. [3]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Jean Piaget\nFigure : Jean Piaget. ( 9.2.1 [1]\n)\nJean Piaget (1896-1980) was a renowned psychologist of the 20th century and a pioneer in developmental psychology. Piaget did not accept the prevailing theory that knowledge was innate. Instead, he believed a child's knowledge and understanding of the world  developed  over  time,  through  the  child's  interactions  with  the  world.  By  observing  that  interaction,  Piaget  was  able  to perceive  how  children  created  schemas  (mental  ways  to  organize  information)  that  shaped  their  perceptions,  cognitions,  and judgment of the world. Just as almost all babies learn to roll over before they learn to sit up by themselves, Piaget believed that children gain their cognitive ability in a developmental order. These insights-that children at different ages think in fundamentally different  ways-led  to  Piaget's  stage  theory  of  cognitive  development.  As  a  stage  theorist,  Piaget  believed  cognitive  change occurred  in  distinct  stages  with  a  fixed-order,  rather  than  continuous  development  that  argued  for  a  more  gradual  continuous process (see Figure for an analogy). Despite various limitations, Piaget's theory of cognitive development is one of the most enduring theories in psychology. 9.2.2 [2]\nFigure : Continuous and discontinuous development depicted by the analogies of a tree growing versus a ladybug life cycle. ( ) 9.2.2 [3]\nPiaget believed that children do not just passively learn but actively try to make sense of their worlds. He argued that, as they learn and mature, children develop schemas that help them remember, organize, and respond to information. Furthermore, Piaget thought that when children experience new things, they attempt to reconcile the new knowledge with existing schemas through methods that he called assimilation and accommodation. [4]\nFigure : Assimilation and Accommodation. ( ) 9.2.3 [5]\nWhen children apply assimilation, they use already developed schemas to understand new information. If children have learned a schema for horses, then they might call the striped animal they see at the zoo a horse rather than a zebra. In this case, children fit the existing schema (knowledge that defines a horse separate from other animals) to the new experience (a zebra) because zebras fit the basic schema of a horse. Accommodation, on the other hand, involves learning new information, and thus changing/updating the schema. When a mother says, 'No, honey, that's a zebra, not a horse,' the child may adapt the schema to fit the new experience, learning that there are different types of four-legged animals, only one of which is a horse and that zebras are unique because of their black and white stripes."

    "context_enriched_content": "Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development\nOver  his  lifetime,  Piaget  contributed  significantly  to  the  study  of  cognitive  development  in  children.  Piaget's  most  important contribution  to  understanding  cognitive  development,  and  the  fundamental  aspect  of  his  theory,  was  the  idea  that  development occurs in unique and distinct stages, with each stage occurring at a specific time, in a sequential manner, and in a way that allows the  child  to  think  about  the  world  using  new  capacities.  Piaget  classified  children's  cognitive  development  into  four  sequential stages: (1) The sensorimotor period from birth to 24 months, (2) the pre-operations period between the approximate ages of two and seven years old, (3) the concrete operational period that begins around age seven and continues through about 11 years old, and (4) the formal operations period that begins around age 11 and continues through adolescence. [2]\nPiaget's Stages of Cognitive Development\n\nSensorimotor, Approximate age range = Birth to about 2 years. Sensorimotor, Characteristics = The child experiences the world through the fundamental senses of seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting.. Sensorimotor, Stage attainments = Object permanence. Preoperational, Approximate age range = 2 to 7 years. Preoperational, Characteristics = Children acquire the ability to internally represent the world through language and mental imagery. They also start to see the world from other people's perspectives.. Preoperational, Stage attainments = Theory of mind; rapid increase in language ability. Concrete operational, Approximate age range = 7 to 11 years. Concrete operational, Characteristics = Children become able to think logically. They can perform operations on objects, but only those which are real (\"concrete\"), not those which are abstract.. Concrete operational, Stage attainments = Conservation\nFormal operational, Approximate range = 11 years to adulthood. Formal operational, age = . Formal operational, Characteristics = Adolescents can think systematically, can reason about abstract concepts, and can understand ethics and scientific reasoning.. Formal operational, Stage attainments = Abstract logic\nFigure : Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development. ( ) 9.2.4 [6]\nAs this text is about infants and toddlers, we will primarily focus on the first stage, the sensorimotor stage, which includes children between the ages of 0 to 2 years. During the sensorimotor stage, children use their senses and motor capabilities to understand the world. In fact, infants' use of their senses to perceive the world is so central to their understanding that whenever infants do not directly perceive objects, as far as they are concerned, the objects do not exist. Piaget found, for instance, that if he first interested infants in a toy and then covered the toy with a blanket, infants who were younger than 6 months of age would act as if the toy had disappeared  completely-they  never  tried  to  find  it  under  the  blanket  but  would  nevertheless  smile  and  reach  for  it  when  the blanket was removed. Piaget found that it was not until about 8 months that the infants realized that the object was merely covered and not gone. Piaget used the term object permanence to refer to the child's ability to know that an object exists even when the object cannot be perceived. [4]\nFigure : 1.

    "context_enriched_content": "Sensorimotor Substages\nThe sensorimotor period begins at birth and continues through the child's first two years. It focuses on the development of schemes as infants' sensory and motor systems interact with the world. There are six substages within the sensorimotor period.\nSensorimotor Substages\nSensorimotor Substage\nAge\nSubstage 1: Simple Reflexes, Age = Birth to 1 month. Substage 2: Primary Circular Reactions, Age = 1 to 4 months. Substage 3: Secondary Circular Reactions, Age = 4 to 8 months. Substage 4: Coordination of Circular Reactions, Age = 8 to 12 months. Substage 5: Tertiary Circular Reactions, Age = 12 to 18 months. Substage 6: Internalization of Schemes and Early Representational Thought, Age = 18 months to 2 years\nStage 1 lasts from birth until around 1 month of age. At this first stage, learning by experiencing the world is largely driven by inborn motor and sensory reflexes, like the sucking and palmar reflexes. With the palmar reflex, when something is placed in the palm of an infant, their involuntary reflex is to close their fingers around it and cling on to it. By doing so, the infant is able to experience  shape,  texture,  temperature,  weight,  etc.,.  The  palmar  reflex  typically  disappears  by  six  months  of  age  (Anekar  & Bordoni, 2020). At this stage, Piaget proposed that learning about the world is not primarily voluntary, instead, infants begin to encounter the world as a result of their inborn reflexes. [2] [8]\nFigure :Infant grasping onto an adult's finger. ( ) 9.2.9 [1]\nStage 2, which occurs approximately between 1 and 4 months, includes the primary circular reaction in which an infant happens to experience an event and then attempts to repeat the action. The infant begins to discriminate between objects and adjust responses accordingly  as  reflexes  are  replaced  with  voluntary  movements.  An  infant  may  accidentally  engage  in  a  behavior  and  find  it interesting,  such  as  making  a  vocalization.  This  interest  motivates  them  to  try  to  do  it  again  and  helps  the  infant  learn  a  new behavior that originally occurred by chance. At first, most actions have to do with the body, but in the months to come, will be directed more toward objects. [2] [8]\nFigure : Infant vocalizing. ( ) 9.2.10 [10]\nStage 3,  which  takes  place  between  4-8  months,  involves  secondary  circular  reactions  when  an  infant  repeats  an  action  with  a specific, desired consequence or to achieve an unrelated consequence. The infant becomes more and more actively engaged in the outside world and takes delight in being able to make things purposely happen on their own. Repeated motion brings particular interest,  for  example,  as  the  infant  is  able  to  bang  two  things  together  or  when  sticking  out  their  tongue  leads  to  their  parents laughing. [2] [8]\nFigure : Infant sticking out her tongue. ( ) 9.2.11 [11]\nStage  4,  which  occurs  approximately  between  8  and  12  months,  comprises  the  use  of  familiar  means  to  obtain  ends.  It  entails deliberate  planning  of  steps  to  meet  a  goal  or  objective.  The  infant  can  engage  in  behaviors  that  others  perform  and  anticipate upcoming events. Perhaps because of continued maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the infant becomes capable of having a thought and carrying out a planned, goal-directed activity such as seeking a toy that has rolled under the couch. The object continues to exist in the infant's mind even when out of sight and the infant now is capable of making attempts to retrieve it.

    "context_enriched_content": "Sensorimotor Substages\nStage 5, which takes place between 12 to 18 months of age, is a tertiary circular reaction in which an infant experiments with their environment using the properties of one object to manipulate another object, in other words, using an experimental object, like a stick, to push a ball that then makes a noise. The infant actively engages in more experimentation to learn about the physical world. Gravity is learned by pouring water from a cup or pushing bowls off of table tops. The caregiver tries to help the child by picking it up again and placing it back on the table. And what happens? Another experiment! The child pushes it off the table again causing it to fall and the caregiver to pick it up again! [2]\nFigure : Infant playing in a pool of water. ( ) 9.2.13 [1]\nStage 6, which occurs approximately between 18 and 24 months, is characterized by insight, wherein the child observes how other people manipulate the environment to reach the desired goal, then the child applies that knowledge to obtain the desired goal. The child is now able to solve problems using mental strategies, to remember something heard days before and repeat it, to engage in pretend play, and to find objects that have been moved even when out of sight. Take for instance, a toddler who is upstairs in a room with the door closed, supposedly taking a nap. The doorknob has a safety device on it that makes it impossible for the child to turn the knob. After trying several times to push the door or turn the doorknob, the child carries out a mental strategy learned from prior experience to get the door opened-knocking on the door! The child is now better equipped with mental strategies for problemsolving. [2]\nFigure : Toddler using an abacus. . ( ) 9.2.14 [1]\nThe culmination of stage 6 and the sensorimotor period is the child's understanding of object permanence, that objects have an existence independent of the child's interaction with them. Classic examples of understanding object permanence include a child's realization  that  when  a  caregiver  leaves  a  room,  the  parent  continues  to  exist,  or  the  child's  attempt  to  recover  a  hidden  toy, indicating the child's understanding that the toy still exists outside of view (Beilin & Fireman,1999).

    "context_enriched_content": "Sensorimotor Stages\nWhile learning about the sensorimotor stage, did you notice how Piaget used observable behaviors from children to understand and categorize cognitive progression? Children reveal their thinking through their observable behaviors. The key then to understanding a  child's  cognitive  development  is  that  we,  as  caregivers,  need  to  take  the  time  to  carefully  observe  and  document  children's behavior. The sensorimotor substages can act like a map to help us understand a child's current cognitive stage and also the next stage(s) they will progress into. Knowing which substage children are in can inform us about the function of their behaviors and provide us insight into possible activities to support their cognitive progression.\nFor example, in stage 3, infants take delight in being able to make things purposefully happen on their own; therefore, caregivers can  consider  including  play  objects  that  infants  can  easily  manipulate  and  that  have  a  'consequence'--an  outcome  that  can  be experienced  by  the  child.  In  comparison,  during  stage  5,  an  infant  directly  experiments  with  their  environment;  therefore, caregivers can include various play objects that can be used to engage with the immediate contextual environment. Children in stage 5 love pouring water back and forth between containers of different sizes and shapes. As contexts change (e.g., inside/outside, water play, table activities, etc.,), so too should the experimental play objects to best encourage experimental curiosity. Remember, the first and most important thing we can do as caregivers is purposefully observe children. Observe the children and how they use objects and then reflect on their behaviors to consider additional or alternative objects to support their experimentation."

    "context_enriched_content": "Preoperational Stage\nAlthough  Piaget  suggested  that  only  one  year  of  toddlerhood  is  spent  in  the  preoperational  stage,  learning  about  this  stage  is important because it sheds light on the future trajectory of cognitive growth in toddlers. Furthermore, the fact that Piaget includes the second year of a child's life in the next stage of cognitive development, highlights the important cognitive growth that occurs from 24 to 36 months of age.\nAt about 2 years of age, and until about 7 years of age, children move into the preoperational stage. During this stage, children begin to use more language and to think more abstractly about objects. The term 'operational' refers to logical manipulation of information,  so  children  at  this  stage  are  considered  pre-operational  because  children's  logic  is  based  on  their  own  personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge. Children also begin to use more conversational language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information. [1] [2]\nThe  preoperational  period  is  defined  by  semiotic  function,  or  representational  thought  through  signs  and  symbols.  This  stage exhibits five characteristic behaviors: imitation, symbolic play, drawing, mental image, and verbal recalling of events. The first behavior, imitation, is when the child models observed behavior even after the disappearance of the thing the child is imitating. For example, the child may mimic a person's dance or how they play with an object, even after the person is no longer present. The next behavior, symbolic play, is a step beyond imitation. This 'make-believe' or 'play pretend' behavior is characterized by the child's ability to project an idea onto an object, symbolically. 'Let's pretend that I am the mama and this is my baby,' and the child points to a stuffed animal. In this example, both the child and the stuffed animals are symbols in the game of make-believe. The third identified behavior, drawing, begins early in the preoperational period, and incorporates both play and imitation. Drawing often begins with scribbles and proceeds to graphic imagery with the representation of objects that are present in the child's world. Through  drawing,  the  child  may  represent  family  members  with  stick  figures,  with  the  key  characteristic  being  that  the  child understands that the stick figures are only representations of the family, not the actual family members. Finally, the verbal recalling of  events,  which  is  the  culmination  of  semiotic  function,  is  the  child's  use  of  language  to  imitate  and  reflect  upon  events  that occurred in the child's past. Mastery of semiotic function is important because it indicates that a child can think and assimilate knowledge rather than merely act on objects that are physically present (Marwaha, Goswami & Vashist, 2017).

Vygotsky stated that children should be taught in the ZPD, which occurs when they can almost perform a task, but not quite on their own without assistance. With the right kind of teaching, however, they can accomplish it successfully. A good teacher identifies a child's ZPD and helps the child stretch beyond it. Then the teacher gradually withdraws support until the child can then perform the task unaided. This highlights the importance of  instructional  decisions  related  to  types  and  quality  of  interactions  in  designing  effective  learning  experiences  for  infants  and toddlers. [1] [3]\nResearchers have applied the metaphor of scaffolds (the temporary platforms on which construction workers stand) to this way of teaching. Scaffolding is the temporary support that caregivers give a child to do a task.   Scaffolding represents the way in which a caregiver guides a child's learning during a goal-oriented task by offering or withdrawing support at different levels depending on the  child's  individual  developmental  level  and  learning  needs.  Scaffoldings  typically  include  a  mutual  and  dynamic  nature  of interaction  where  both  the  learner  and  the  one  providing  the  scaffold  influence  each  other  and  adjust  their  behavior  as  they collaborate.  In  an  interactive  game  of  peek-a-book,  a  caregiver  can  scaffold  an  infant's  attention  and  understanding  of  object permanence by changing the length of time they stay hidden and by changing how they reveal themselves (e.g., using their hands or another object to hide behind). Research suggests that even in infancy scaffolding plays an important role in the development of cognitive  abilities  (Cuevas  et  al.  2014;  Matte-Gagné  &  Bernier  2011;    Neale  &  Whitebread,  2019).  Ideas  such  as  the  ZPD  and scaffolding bring to light a fundamentally different view of a caregiver who serves more as a facilitator of learning rather than someone providing  general  knowledge.  Likewise,  the  learner  takes  on  more  responsibilities  such  as  determining  their  learning goals,  becoming  a  resource  of  knowledge  for  peers,  and  actively  collaborating  in  the  learning  process  (Grabinger,  Aplin,  & Ponnappa-Brenner,  2007).  This  often  contrasts  with  how  many  people  perceive  education--as  the  teacher  being  the  source  of knowledge and the teacher directly giving their knowledge to the children. [1] [4] [3]\nFigure : Caregiver assisting a toddler in the garden. ( ) 9.4.2 [5]\nFor infant and toddler caregivers, every interaction, whether during play or a care routine, is an opportunity to engage with a child inside  their  ZPD.  To  begin  to  engage  with  an  infant  or  toddler  inside  their  ZPD,  we  must  first  purposefully  observe  them. Beginning with observation is critical because it allows us to first understand what the child is interested in and hypothesize about what their goals may be. Furthermore, observation reveals their current ability or understanding about the activity and objects they are engaged in. Next, we should then reflect upon our observations and consider our role within the child's ZPD. What type and level  of  assistance  can  we  offer  to  the  child?  What  is  the  least  amount  of  assistance  we  can  provide  as  guidance?  While implementing assistance to the child, we should constantly be reflecting upon how our assistance changes their activity and reflect upon our potential new role as their behaviors change.\nFigure : Infant and caregiver exploring flowers.

Contingency  describes  the  extent  to  which  a caregiver's interaction is dependent upon attributes of the child (for example their age, ability, attention, interest, and whether or not they are struggling with the task at hand). A contingent caregiver response is one which occurs when a child requires help of some kind, as opposed to assistance which appears unnecessary because it occurs when a child is coping adequately. A contingent response will also provide the appropriate level of support to assist the child - not taking over the task completely, and not giving too little assistance to not have any effect. As a result, to respond contingently, a caregiver must be present in the unfolding of an activity and observe the child carefully. [4]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Development and learning originate in social, historical, and cultural interactions.\nVygotsky contended that thinking has social origins. Social interactions play a critical role especially in the development of higher order thinking skills, and cognitive development cannot be fully understood without considering the social and historical context within which it is embedded. He explained, 'Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first between people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological)'\n(Vygotsky, 1978). It is only through working with others on a variety of tasks that a child adopts socially-shared experiences and acquires useful strategies and knowledge (Scott & Palincsar, 2013). [3]\nBarbara Rogoff (1990) refers to this process as guided participation, where a learner actively acquires new culturally valuable skills and capabilities through a meaningful, collaborative activity with an assisting, more experienced other, such as a caregiver. It is critical to notice that these culturally-mediated functions are viewed as being embedded in sociocultural activities rather than being self-contained. Development is a 'transformation of participation in a sociocultural activity' not a transmission of discrete cultural knowledge or skills (Matusov, 2015). The processes of guided participation reveal the Vygotskian view of cognitive development 'as the transformation of socially-shared activities into internalized processes,' or an act of enculturation (John-Steiner & Mahn, 1996). In this way, children cognitively learn about the world by participating in it with others. [3]\nExamples of guided participation can be seen when caregivers involve infants and toddlers in everyday routines. In her research with Mayan families in Guatemala, Rogoff et al., (1993) reported mothers guiding their toddlers through the process of making tortillas.  Mothers  would  give  the  toddlers  small  balls  of  dough  to  practice  rolling  and  flattening.  This  cultural  practice  both contributed to the child's cognitive development and their learning of practices important for their culture. As another example, consider a group care setting during meal time where toddlers are seated with a caregiver and the meal is separated into larger bowls on the table where the toddlers are seated. The toddlers are able to participate in the routine by serving themselves using the serving spoons and then feed themselves using the utensils. The first few times this routine is started, the caregiver may do more serving  and  guiding,  but  eventually,  through  practiced  participation,  toddlers  are  able  to  participate  more  deeply,  all  the  while learning culturally-valuable skills such as turn-taking, conversation around a meal, vocabulary and the motor skills needed to serve and eat.\nThis  Vygotskian  notion  of  social  learning  stands  in  contrast  to  some  of  Piaget's  more  popular  ideas  of  cognitive  development, which  assume  that  development  through  certain  stages  is  biologically  determined,  originates  in  the  individual,  and  precedes cognitive  complexity.  This  difference  in  assumptions  has  significant  implications  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  learning experiences.  If  we  believe,  as  Piaget  did,  that  development  precedes  learning,  then  we  will  make  sure  that  new  concepts  and problems are not introduced until learners have first developed the capabilities to understand them. On the other hand, if we believe as Vygotsky did that learning drives development and that development occurs as we learn a variety of challenging concepts and principles with others, then we will ensure that activities are structured in ways that promote interaction. We will know that it is the process of learning that enables achievement of higher levels of development, which in turn affects a child's 'readiness to learn a new concept' (Miller, 2011). [3]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Private Speech\nDo  you  ever  talk  to  yourself?  Why?  Chances  are,  this  occurs  when  you  are  struggling  with  a  problem,  trying  to  remember something, or feel very emotional about a situation. Children talk to themselves too. Piaget interpreted this as Egocentric Speech or a practice engaged in because of a child's inability to see things from another's point of view. Vygotsky, however, believed that children talk to themselves in order to solve problems or clarify thoughts. As children learn to think in words, they do so aloud before eventually closing their lips and engaging in private speech or inner speech. Thinking out loud eventually becomes thought accompanied by internal speech, and talking to oneself becomes a practice only engaged in when we are trying to learn something or remember something. This inner speech is not as elaborate as the speech we use when communicating with others (Vygotsky, 1962). Despite the fact that toddlers are still progressing through the early stages of language acquisition, they nevertheless use private speech. For example, young toddlers, between 14 to 18 months of age, independently use gestures to help think through the use of complex toys and for self-regulation (Basilio & Rodríguez, 2017) and when left alone in their bed at night, toddlers sing to themselves as a way to 'practice musical skills, reflect, experiment, self-soothe, and understand their own worlds' (Sole, 2017). [1]\nFigure : Toddler constructing block tower. ( ) 9.4.4 [7]\nAlthough Piaget's  theory  of  cognitive  development  receives  more  attention,  sociocultural  theory  has  several  widely  recognized strengths. First, it emphasizes the broader social, cultural, and historical context of all human activity. It does not view individuals as isolated entities; rather, it provides a richer perspective, focusing on the fluid boundary between self and others. It portrays the dynamics of a child acquiring knowledge and skills from the society and then in turn shaping their own personal environment (Miller,  2011).  Second,  sociocultural  theory  is  sensitive  to  individual  and  cross-cultural  diversity.  In  contrast  to  the  universal aspects of Piaget's theory, sociocultural theory acknowledges both differences in individuals within a culture and differences in individuals across cultures. It recognizes that 'different historical and cultural circumstances may  encourage  different developmental routes to any given developmental endpoint' depending on particular social or physical circumstances and cultural tools available (Miller, 2011). Finally, sociocultural theory greatly contributes to our understanding of cognitive development by integrating the notion of learning and development. The idea of learning driving development rather than being determined by a developmental  level  or  age  of  the  child  fundamentally  changes  our  understanding  of  the  learning  process  and  has  significant instructional and educational implications for the care and education of infants and toddlers.

    "context_enriched_content": "Limitations of Vygotsky's Theory\nThere are critical limitations to the sociocultural perspective. The first limitation is related to Vygotsky's premature death, as many of his ideas remained incomplete. Furthermore, his work was largely unknown until fairly recently due to political reasons and issues with translation. The second major limitation is associated with the vagueness of the ZPD. Individuals may have wide or narrow zones, which may be both desirable and undesirable, depending on the circumstances. Knowing only the width of the zone 'does not provide an accurate picture of a child's learning, ability, style of learning, and current level of development compared to other children of the same age and degree of motivation' (Miller, 2011). Additionally, there is little known about whether a child's zone is comparable across different learning domains, with different individuals, and whether the size of the zone changes over time. And importantly, there is not a common metric scale to measure ZPD. [3]\n[1]\nLally & Valentine-French (2019). Lifespan Development: A Psychological Perspective.

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding the Theory of Core Knowledge\nThe theory of core knowledge proposes that infants are born with 'core knowledge systems' that support basic intuitions about the world  (Spelke  &  Kinzler,  2007).  Whereas  Piaget  claimed  that  children  construct  knowledge  by  engaging  with  the  world  and Vygotsky  claimed  children  develop  cognitively  by  participating  with  others  in  culturally-relevant  activities,  the  theory  of  core knowledge  claims  that  children  are  born  with  basic  knowledge.  Supporters  of  this  theory  suggest  that  the  many  studies documenting  cognitive  abilities  in  just  the  first  few  months  of  infancy,  provide  evidence  for  this  theory.  For  example,  Renée Baillargeon's early work discovered that object permanence is developed in infants at a much younger age than Piaget proposed-already by 3 to 4 months of age (Baillargeon, 1987)! The fact that infants have an understanding of object permanence already, in only the first few months of life, suggests that this knowledge might be inborn. [1]\nIn one experiment on object permanence, young infants were familiarized with a display in which a screen lying flat and facing the infant rotated up and away from the infant 180° in the manner of a drawbridge (Baillargeon, 1987). During the test phase, a new object was then placed at the far edge of the screen, which either did or did not impede the rotating screen (see Figure for a depiction  of  the  experimental  scenarios).  In  the  'impossible'  scenario,  the  screen  moved  exactly  as  during  familiarization, appearing  to  rotate  right  through  the  object.  In  the  'possible'  scenario,  the  screen  rotated  only  to  the  point  where  it  would  be expected to make contact with the object and then stopped moving. Infants looked longer at the 'impossible' scenario than the 'possible' scenario - which was interpreted in terms of a violation of infants' expectations regarding object permanence. In another experiment on object permanence (see Figure for a visual depiction of the scenarios), 3 to 4 month old infants looked longer at an impossible event (tall carrot moving behind a box with a section cut out near the top of the box that should have shown the green top of the carrot as it moved behind the box) than the possible event (short carrot moving behind a box with a section cut out near the top of the box that should not have shown the green top of the carrot as it moved behind the box) (Baillargeon & DeVos, 1991). 9.5.1 9.5.1\nFamiliarization phase\nImpossible scenario\nPossible scenario\nFigure : Depiction of the object permanence stimuli from Baillargeon (1987). Side view of habituation and test displays. In both  conditions,  infants  were  habituated  to  a  180°  drawbridge-like  motion.  The  decline  and  plateau  of  looking  times  during habituation are depicted. In the Experimental Condition, infants completed two types of test trials, both of which contained a new object on the far side of the display. The Impossible Test involved the same full 180° rotation from habituation, but now the screen surprisingly passed through the box as it completed its rotation (with the box disappearing as it became obscured). The Possible Test involved a novel shorter rotation of screen up to the point where it would contact the box, where it stopped; this motion was 'possible'  in  terms  of  solidity  and  object  permanence,  but  was  more perceptually  novel than  the  Impossible  Test.  infants dishabituated to the Impossible Test but not the Possible Test. However, in the Control Condition no preference was observed. 9.5.1\nThese results were interpreted as reflecting the violation of infants' expectations regarding solidity and/or object permanence..

Unlike  Piaget's  and  Vygotsky's theories, the theory of core knowledge suggests that some aspects of early knowledge do not need to be learned with experience or from more knowledgeable others because children are instead born with this knowledge.

    "context_enriched_content": "Theory of Information Processing\nInformation processing theory uses the analogy of a computer to consider how the mind works.\nIt  is  theorized  that  cognitive  processes  work  in  specific  sequences,  as  does  a  computer,  by  receiving  input,  processing  the information,  and  delivering  an  output.  In  this  way,  the  mind  functions  like  a  biological  computer  responsible  for  processing information from the environment. As children grow, their brains also grow, leading to advances in their ability to cognitively process the information they receive. In contrast with Piaget's theory of cognitive development that proposed development occurs in stages, information processing theory instead emphasizes a continuous pattern of development. [1]\nMemory is one cognitive process that is commonly used to explain information processing theory. The idea is that there are specific steps  in  the  memory  process,  similar  to  how  information  storage  on  a  computer  can  involve  multiple  distinct  steps.  Using  the Atkinson and Shiffrin Model shown in Figure , memory has three main components in which information can flow in and out of the memory system. The process begins when information from our senses flows into sensory memory. If we pay attention to this information, it then enters short-term memory where, if attention is further maintained toward it, it can continue on to longterm memory. 9.6.1 [1]\nFigure :  Environmental input to Sensory input (sights, sounds, etc.) both feeding into Sensory memory, from where it can either  be  forgotten  or  into  short-term  memory.  In  short-term  memory  it's  either  forgotten  through  decay  or  displacement  of maintenance occurs through rehearsal. A two-way exchange between short-term memory and long term memory occurs. During this exchange elaborate rehearsal leads to storage (short term to long term) or items are retrieved from short term into long term. 9.6.1\nOnce in long term it can be forgotten through interference or retrieval failure. ( ) [2]\nAlong with suggesting specific steps in cognitive processes, following the analogy of a computer, information processing theory explains growth in cognitive abilities through continuous maturational growth in cognitive systems and the brain. Whereas Piaget proposed stages based on ages to represent important periods of change in cognitive growth, information processing theory instead examines the  continuous  growth  in  cognitive  processes.  Consider  the  cognitive  process  of  visual  working  memory,  which  is  a cognitive system that actively holds visual information, such as the color or shape of something, in the mind temporarily for use in ongoing tasks. Research reveals a continuous increase in visual working memory capacity over the first year (Rose et al., 2001; Kaldy  and  Leslie,  2003,  2005;  Oakes  et  al.,  2006,  2017;  Kibbe  and  Leslie,  2011;  Kwon  et  al.,  2014;  Kaldy  et  al.,  2016)  that continues to develop into childhood (Simmering, 2012; Guillory et al., 2018). For example, ten and twelve month-old infants are successful in remembering three objects but are unable to remember more than three objects (Feigenson and Carey, 2003, 2005). Similarly, brain research has found visual working memory activation evident by 4 months of age with continuous developmental change between 4 months and one year of age (Reyes et al., 2020). As an example of how growth in some cognitive systems influence  the  abilities  in  other  cognitive  systems,  fourteen  month-old  infants  can  use  high-level  strategies  such  as  chunking  to remember more items (Feigenson and Halberda, 2004; Kibbe and Feigenson, 2016). Information processing research continues to document the continuous growth in cognitive processes of infants and toddlers.

Both of these theories continue to be highly influential  in  leading  discussions  of  cognitive  development in young children.

Despite the strengths and limitations of each theory,  what  is  clear  is  that  recent  research  has  revealed  that  infants  and  toddlers  know  more  about  the  world  than  was  once thought, and it is through their active engagement with the world and quality interactions with others that is most important for ongoing cognitive development.\nThis page titled 9.7: Conclusion is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

There are rectangle stacking blocks of various colors and sizes and a recycled food container that has a circle cut into the lid.

First, children are actively making sense of the world around them through interactions with the physical and the social world. Like young scientists, they use their knowledge to make hypotheses, then act upon them, constantly updating their knowledge based on the results. In this way, it is through the interactions with the physical and social worlds that cognition primarily grows; therefore, the quality of the physical and social environments and overall learning experiences of infants and  toddlers  is  of  utmost  importance  for  supporting  optimal  cognitive  development.  As  evidence,  let's  next  consider  how  the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the significance  of  early  learning  experiences  for  supporting  cognitive  development  in infants and toddlers.\nImages adapted from Ashley Siokwu licensed under CC by 3.0 [1]\nThis page titled 10.2: Observing Cognition is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "COVID-19 and Quality Care\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 and was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus spread throughout the world and in the spring of 2020, many schools and childcare centers in the U.S. closed in an effort to reduce its spread and impact.\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  presented  a  unique  opportunity  to  explore  the  importance  of  learning  experiences  on  the  cognitive development of  infants  and  toddlers  as  the  childcare  arrangements  of  children  changed.  Compared  to  toddlers  born  before  the pandemic, children born during the pandemic showed lower scores in cognition, language and motor abilities as toddlers (Deoni, Beauchemin, Volpe & D'Sa, 2021; Huang et al.m 2021; Shuffrey et al., 2021). The negative cognitive impact was greatest for boys and  for  children  from  lower  socioeconomic  backgrounds.  These  results  suggest  the  pandemic  somehow  changed  learning experiences enough to make a significant impact on the experiences that support optimal cognitive development. Although there are various potential contributing factors that could be argued to explain these results (e.g., reduced social interaction, increased screen time, increased parental stress, etc.,), one significant contributing factor was the care and educational experiences infants and toddlers received during the pandemic. [1]\nFigure : Toddler wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. ( ) 10.3.1 [2]\nDuring the early months of the pandemic childcare arrangements shifted. Some childcare providers closed temporarily and later opened with strict protocols. Many children, instead of attending a group care program, stayed home under the care of parents and extended  family.  The  various  experiences  infants  and  toddlers  received  during  the  pandemic  had  an  impact  on  their  cognitive development.\nOne study examined how childcare arrangements during the pandemic impacted cognitive growth in infants and toddlers (Davies et al.,  2021).  Their  data  revealed  that  children  who  attended  infant  and  toddler  group  care  programs  during  the  pandemic  showed greater cognitive growth, regardless of their socioeconomic background. The benefits of attending infant and toddler group care programs for cognitive development, compared to other childcare arrangements such as care from a family member, may be due to group care programs being more likely to implement developmentally appropriate learning materials and adult-child interactions which scaffold learning, and have been shown to promote early cognitive development (Clark et al., 2013; DeJoseph, Sifre, Raver, Blair, & Berry, 2021; Rosen et al., 2020). [3]\nInterestingly, compared to children who attended infant and toddler group care programs, informal childcare by family members did not show the same benefits for cognitive growth (Davies et al., 2021). Although the overall evidence is mixed regarding the cognitive benefits of informal childcare (Green, Pearce, Parkes, Robertson, & Katikireddi, 2020; Hansen & Hawkes, 2009; Laing &  Bergelson,  2019;  Melhuish  et  al.,  2015),  the  strengths  of  infant  and  toddler  group  care  programs,  such  as  caregiver-child interactions,  predictable  schedules,  lower  screen  use,  and  caregiver  education  is  likely  to  be  important  for  supporting  cognitive growth (Dowsett, Huston, Imes, & Gennetian, 2008). [3]\nFigure : Caregiver wearing a mask while holding an infant. ( ) 10.3.2 [4]\nThe handful of studies that have examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cognitive development of infants and toddlers have highlighted the role learning experiences have in supporting cognitive development. In particular, the quality of the care and educational experiences infants and toddlers receive are related to their cognitive growth. These findings further document the significant role infant and toddler caregivers have in creating safe and high quality contexts that contribute to the trajectory of cognitive development in children.\nIn  the  next  section  we  will  discuss  four  factors  of  infant  and  toddler  quality  group  care  that  support  cognitive  development: environments, materials, experiences and interactions."

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development and the Environment\nEnvironments are significant in supporting cognitive development because they are both the stimulating backdrop and the active contributor  of  learning.  Therefore,  we  should  change  the  way  we  think  of  environments-we  should  think  of  them  as  learning environments instead of simply physical environments. Learning environments are nurturing spaces that support the development of  all  young  children.  They  include  classrooms,  play  spaces,  areas  for  caregiving  routines,  and  outdoor  areas.  Learning environments  are  well-organized  and  managed  settings.  They  offer  developmentally-appropriate  schedules,  indoor  and  outdoor opportunities for  choice,  play,  exploration,  and  experimentation.  Learning  environments  include  age-appropriate  equipment  and materials They integrate home cultures and are flexible to support the changing ages, interests, and characteristics of a group of children over time. [1]\nFigure :  Which includes a bench with two storage baskets within. A small size armchair with a pillow and two child size cubbies in the corner. Children's artwork and pictures adorn the wall.  ( ) 10.4.1 [2]\nThe educational framework of Reggio Emilia holds the classroom environment to a special status and therefore provides a great perspective  to  learn  about  how  the  environment  can  support  cognitive  development.  Reggio  Emilia  was  founded  by  Loris Malaguzzi (1920-1994) to provide provisions for children of the city of Reggio Emilia, Italy, after World War II (Wien, 2008). The Reggio Emilia philosophy perceives physical space as a primary aspect of cognitive development, envisioned as a third teacher (Wien, 2008). What do you think it means to consider the environment as a third teacher? The importance of the environment lies in  the  belief  that  children  can  best  create  meaning and make sense of their world through environments that support \"complex, varied,  sustained,  and  changing  relationships  between  people,  the  world  of  experience,  ideas  and  the  many  ways  of  expressing ideas.' (Cadwell, 1997). While infants and toddlers are active meaning makers, the quality of materials and interactions in their environments influence the quality of meaning that they can make. [3] [4]\nPhysically, Reggio Emilia classrooms generally incorporate natural light and indoor plants. Classrooms capture the attention of children through the use of mirrors, photographs, and children's work accompanied by transcriptions. Other supportive elements of the environment include ample space for supplies, frequently rearranged to draw attention to their aesthetic features. The Reggio Emilia environment informs and engages the viewer while always making an effort to create opportunities for children to interact. [4]\nFigure :  A  childsize  table  with  a  low  profile  woven  basket  and  small  wooden  objects  within.  Two  life  plans  and  a  large window letting in natural light sit behind the table.  ( ) 10.4.2 [5]\nWith this basic understanding of some of the ideas related to how Reggio Emilia regards learning environments, we can now start to consider important factors for creating learning environments in infant and toddler classrooms. Here are some factors, inspired by Reggio Emilia, to consider for the environments of infants and toddlers: [3]\n- Create environments that have an open concept, allowing flow between rooms and amongst areas within a classroom. Windows, indoor plants and materials from nature create a feeling of flow between indoor and outdoor spaces.\n- Photographs hung on walls should represent the children, their families and individuals of various cultures who are enrolled in the program and that make up the local community.\n- Hang child-created artwork around the classroom ensuring they are placed on walls that are located at heights the children can easily visually engage with.\n- Label shelves and containers to support early literacy and help make the process of finding and cleaning easier.\n- Consider how the type of storage impacts invitation and ease of access. Storing and displaying materials in clear containers and open baskets visually invites children to play with them and provides easy access without challenging lids to open.\nFigure :  Play  materials stored in open baskets on a low shelf.  The bottom shelf contains various size wooden rings in a wooden basket. The upper woven basket contains clean wine corks.  ( 10.4.3 [6]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development and the Environment\nIn  addition  to  the  overall  physical  setting  of  the  environment,  it  is  important  to  consider  how  materials  in  the  environment  are arranged.

Therefore,  materials  should  be  developmentallyappropriate, intriguing and easily accessible. Figure shows two collections of materials stored in baskets on a shelf.

    "context_enriched_content": "Materials and Cognitive Development\nJean  Piaget's  theory  of  cognitive  development  proposed  a  pivotal  connection  between  experiences  and  cognitive  development during  the  sensorimotor  stage  of  infancy  and  toddlerhood.  The  sensorimotor  period  begins  at  birth  and  continues  through  the child's  first  two  years.  During  this  stage,  infants  and  toddlers  experience  the  world  through  sensation  (sensory)  and  movement (motor). Materials can stimulate both sensory and motor experiences and therefore are an important way to support the cognitive development of infants and toddlers. [1]\nTo encourage exploration, the selection of materials provided to infants and toddlers should be age-appropriate and based on what caregivers observe them to be interested in. As infants age, their strategies for exploring materials changes. For example, mouthing is a predominant form of exploration at 6 months of age but is exchanged for more refined forms of manual exploration later in infancy (Kaur, Srinivasan & Bhat, 2015). Another example can be seen in the developmental changes in grasping ability. Infants improve their grasping abilities  between  6  and  15  months  of  age  (Butterworth,  Verweij  &  Hopkins,  1997).  Similarly,  12  to  14 month old infants show appropriate, anticipatory changes in grasp formation based on object shape and size compared to 5 to 6 month old infants (Barrett et al., 2008; Fagard, 2000). Infants with more advanced motor abilities (i.e., those who could crawl, stand,  or  walk)  are  more  interested  in  objects  with  handles  (Nelson  &  Oakes,  2021).  Based  on  this  research,  caregivers  should observe the developmental changes of infants and toddlers, such as exploration and grasping strategies, and provide materials that continue to challenge, intrigue and support their age-appropriate developing abilities. For example, consider the collection of play materials in Figure .  How might the different developing grasping abilities of infants and toddlers influence how they are able to hold, manipulate and explore the various materials? 10.5.1 [1]\nFigure :  V arious play materials including Various play materials which include wooden cars, small rings and balls, plastic people and golf ball size wiffle balls.   ( 10.5.1 [3]\nAlong with age-appropriateness, exploratory behaviors are also influenced by material properties including size, shape, texture, and weight of objects (Barrett et al., 2008; Bourgeois et al., 2005; Corbetta & Snapp-Childs, 2009; Libertus et al., 2013; Newell et al., 1989, 1993; van Hof et al., 2002). For example, infants showed greater grasping of smaller objects whereas they looked more at larger objects (Rochat, 1989). In addition, 9 to 12 month old infants explored object properties such as shape, size, and texture by rotating, fingering, and transferring objects, whereas they explored properties such as weight, sound, and rigidity by banging and shaking objects (Ruff, 1984). Infants' grasping patterns depended on object size and structure as smaller objects were grasped with one hand and larger objects were grasped with two hands (Kaur, Srinivasan & Bhat, 2015). Similarly, infants squeezed non-rigid objects  more  compared  to  rigid  objects  (Barrett  et  al.,  2008;  Newell  et  al.,  1989,  1993).  This  research  suggests  that  caregivers should constantly be observing the developing abilities of infants and toddlers and providing age-appropriate materials based on these close observations.

    "context_enriched_content": "Loose Parts\nLoose parts refers to materials that are open-ended and manipulable (Nicholson, 1971). Loose parts are moveable, non-dictated materials that children can use in a variety of ways (Daly & Beloglovsky, 2015; Maxwell, Mitchell, & Evans, 2008). Loose parts are often considered in contrast to pre-designed toys, like most toys sold at stores. For example, a toy airplane, if provided to a\nchild, will probably be used in a limited number of ways, limited to what the toy is, an airplane. In contrast, materials such as leaves and popsicle sticks affords creative engagement with unlimited ways to interact with the materials. Figure is a picture of a loose parts table with various objects from nature: small pumpkins, leaves, slices of trunk from a small tree, sticks, etc., and tools like tweezers and magnifying glasses, to support further exploration. Take a moment to look over the objects and tools in Figure , then consider these questions: 10.5.2 10.5.2 [4]\n- What do you imagine toddlers doing while at the table?\n- How many different ways of using the materials can you imagine for toddlers?\n- How do the carefully selected tools (twissors, magnify glasses) further support exploration than would probably happen if the tools were not present?\n- What other tools could be added?\n- What cognitive concepts are toddlers experiencing as they engage with the materials?\nFigure : Materials from nature. ( ) 10.5.2 [5]\nWhen children have exposure to intriguing loose parts, they become curious. Children's curiosity is triggered when they see and experience new things and have unique experiences that may not be otherwise possible in the indoor environment. This sense of curiosity is how children become inspired to engage in new explorations and discoveries (Perry, 2004). Loose parts give children the freedom to develop their play experiences based on their personal ideas and goals, rather than the play being predetermined by the materials or surroundings (Änggård, 2011). This means that the materials do not dictate the type of play children engage in. Children create play episodes based on their past experiences, curiosity, creativity, and new ideas.

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development and Interactions\nWhile materials are indeed important for supporting cognitive development, the interactions we, as caregivers, have with infants and toddlers may be even more important. Toddlers who experience more language from caregivers have greater cognitive abilities later in childhood (Brown, Wang & McLeod, 2022; Marchman & Fernald, 2008). One study examined features of childcare quality for two year olds and their potential association to later cognitive abilities when the same children were four years of age (Côté et al.,  2013).  Childcare  quality  was  measured  using  two  dimensions.  The  'Provision  for  Learning'  dimension  measured  the availability, accessibility, and diversity of activities available for children. The 'Teaching and Interactions' dimension measured the quality of the interaction and engagement between caregivers and children. Overall, higher levels of quality childcare at age two was  associated  with  stronger  cognitive  abilities  at  age  four.  Of  the  two  dimensions,  it  was  the  dimension  of  'Teaching  and Interactions' that was associated with longitudinal cognitive performance, supporting the role of quality interactions for cognitive growth. Interestingly, the 'Provision of Learning' dimension did not significantly contribute to later cognitive development.\nFigure : Infants interacting with a caregiver. ( ) 10.6.1 [1]\nThese results are supported by numerous studies that also have found it is the quality of relationships and the interactions within these relationships during infancy and toddlerhood that are most significant for supporting cognitive development and long-term cognitive growth (Forget-Dubois et al., 2009; Fraley, Roisman, & Haltigan, 2013; Marchman & Fernarld, 2008; McCormick et al., 2020; Rodriguez & Tamis-LeMonda, 2011). In a longitudinal study, Tamis-LeMonda and colleagues (2019) found that the early learning environments of infants and toddlers predicted their later academic skills all the way out into fifth grade. Using the phrase 'learning  environment'  can  be  slightly  misleading  as  it  may  lead  one  to  think  only  about  the  physical  environment  and objects/materials.  While  one  dimension  of  it  did  focus  on  stimulating  objects/materials,  the  other  two  dimensions  focused  on stimulating  engagement  and  interactions  (frequency  of  engaging  children  in  literacy  activities  and  sensitive  and  stimulating interactions). The research is clear: access to quality learning materials is important, but it is the quality of the interactions while using these materials that may be the most important.\nWhat is the take away message for infant and toddler caregivers?\n- Consider communication to be an integral part of the curriculum.\n- If you plan an activity, do not just consider what the child will be doing, but also consider the critical role of the adult and their interactions during the activity.\n- Enroll in or provide staff training that demonstrates how to improve interactions with infants and toddlers.\n- Implement caregiving policies that support and encourage quality interactions, such as primary care, small groups, continuity of care, individualized care, culturally responsive care, and inclusive care.\nImage by ParentiPacek on Pixabay.

    "context_enriched_content": "Cognitive Development and Experiences\nThe overall value of high quality experiences infants and toddlers receive during childcare supports their cognitive development. High-quality, center-based childcare during the first three years of life shows benefits for children's cognitive, language, and social development at school entry and beyond, across a range of national contexts (Albers, Riksen-Walraven & de Weerth, 2010; Barnes & Melhuish, 2017; Burchinal et al., 2000; Camilli, Vargas, Ryan, & Barnett, 2010; Drange & Havnes, 2019; Eryigit-Madzwamuse & Barnes, 2014; Hansen & Hawkes, 2009; Melhuish et al., 2015; Melhuish & Gardiner, 2017; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network, 2000; Ruzek et al., 2014). These effects are particularly pronounced in children from disadvantaged backgrounds (Connell & Prinz, 2002; Felfe, Nollenberger, & Rodríguez-Planas, 2015; Geoffroy et al.,  2007,  2010;  Larose,  Côté,  Ouellet-Morin, Maughan, & Barker, 2020; Melhuish, 2004; Melhuish et al., 2015), meaning that investment in early childhood education and care is a powerful way of reducing socioeconomic inequalities (Bustamante et al., 2021; Center on the Developing Child, 2010; Heckman, 2006; Reynolds, 2021). [1]\nFigure : Toddler experimenting with water and buckets outside. ( ) 10.7.1 [2]\nWhile the benefits of center-based childcare is well documented, the quality of care and education for infants and toddlers is not created equal as numerous studies have documented dramatically different differences in childcare quality (Kuchirko & Nayfeld, 2020; Kuchirko & Tamis-LeMonda, 2019). In a national study of Early Head Start center-based programs for infants and toddlers in the U.S., most classrooms were of midrange quality with higher scores in the area of emotional and behavioral support and lower scores  in  the  area  of  engaged  support  for  learning  (V ogel  et  al.,  2015).  The  National  Institute  of  Child  Health  and  Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care is one of the largest research projects on early childcare in the U.S. and has followed  over  1,000  children  longitudinally  to  measure  the  long  term  impact  of  experiencing  high  quality  infant  and  toddler childcare. Children who received higher quality care as infants and toddlers scored higher on cognitive tests across the first three years and all the way through adolescence (Belsky, 2006; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2001; Vandell et al., 2010). Importantly, caregiver language (asking questions, responding to child vocalizations, etc.,) was the strongest predictor of cognitive development. [3]\nThe research is clear: high quality infant and toddler care is important for supporting cognition, but what does high quality care look  like?  The  overall  quality  of  care  and  education  for  infants  and  toddlers  is  commonly  separated  into  two  componentsstructural  quality  and  process  quality  (Beller  et  al.  1996;  Howes  &  Rubenstein,  1983;  Penn,  2011;  Phillipsen  et  al.,  1997). Structural quality refers to components such as the physical environment (buildings, space and materials), child-staff ratios, staff education and training, and curriculum (Barros et al., 2016; Slot et al., 2015; OECD, 2006). On the other hand, process quality focuses on the nature of interactions between the children and caregivers, among children, and among adults-teachers, parents, staff, and on the nature of leadership and pedagogy (Barros et al., 2016;   Cryer 1999; Goelman et al. 2006; Slot, 2017; Thomason & La Paro, 2009; Vandell and Wolfe 2000). Structural quality is easier to measure although process quality may be more strongly related to greater developmental outcomes. [4]\nFigure : Caregiver with older infant sitting in lap.

Studies that have used the ITERS to assess quality have found low scores in general. Research  in  the  U.S.  has  found  quality  scores  of  infant  and  toddler  programs  to  be  in  the  low  to  medium  range  (La  Paro, Williamson & Hatfield, 2014; Tietze & Cryer, 2004). For example, one study examined the quality of 93 toddler programs across the  state  of  North  Carolina  and  found  that  83%  of  the  programs  were  in  the  mid-range,  with  scores  between  3  to  5  (La  Paro, Williamson & Hatfield, 2014). While childcare centers in the U.S. score higher in overall average quality compared to most other countries, there is more variance in the quality of U.S. programs compared to other countries (Vermeer et al., 2016). Higher than average quality scores have also been found in Australia (Fenech, Sweller & Harrison, 2010).\nITERS scores from around the world are low. Results from studies in the Netherlands found an overall quality score on the ITERS to be at the minimal level, with an average score of 3, and showing a downward trend in quality over time (Helmerhorst et al., 2015; Vermeer et al., 2008). Seventy-five childcare centers in Eastern and Western Germany had an average ITERS score of 3.2 (Tietze  &  Cryer,  2004).  Three  studies  in  Portugal  reported  poor-quality  care  and  education  with  scores  all  under  3  (Barros  & Aguiar, 2010; Pessanha et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2013). Results from a study of 93 centers in Norway found a minimal average quality  of  3.9  (Bjørnestad  &  Os,  2018).  In  Greece,  infant  and  toddler  programs  ranged  between  2.60  to  5.40  using  ITERS (Megalonidou, 2020). In England, 75 childcare centers were assessed and found to have a mean score of 4.2 (Smith et al. 2009). Chile  reported  an  ITERS  score  between  3  to  4,  with  public  childcare  centers  (3.08)  scoring  lower  than  private  centers  (3.57) (Cárcamo et al., 2014). Across seventy-nine infant and toddler classrooms from Jinan, in the Shandong province in eastern China, the overall mean score was 3.50 (Hu et al., 2019). Overall quality was low in Ecuador with an average score of 2.08 (Lopez Boo, Dormal & Weber, 2019). [4]\nFigure : Toddler experimenting with bubbles. ( ) 10.7.3 [6]\nWhat is the take away message for infant and toddler caregivers?\n- Quality of learning experiences during the first three years is related to later cognitive abilities.\n- Infants and toddlers who attend center-based programs of higher quality have higher cognitive scores later in childhood and adolescence.\n- The overall quality of care and education infants and toddlers experience can vary widely.\n- While programs in the U.S. tend to receive average quality scores in the midrange and above, U.S. programs have been found to vary greatly in quality.\n- While a handful of countries receive quality scores in the midrange and above, many more countries consistently receive scores of low quality, emphasizing the importance of education and training for infant and toddler caregivers and staff.\n- Caregivers can use measures of program quality, such as the ITERS-R, to assess the quality of their programs, identify areas of lower performance and strive to improve.\n- As process quality may be more strongly related to cognitive development than structural quality, caregivers can seek to actively improve their abilities and strategies for engaging with infants and toddlers, especially in terms of language exposure."

Beyond the amazing feat that infants and toddlers acquire complex language systems rapidly and with relative ease, language changes a child's interactions with the people around them and how they think about their physical surroundings. Language affords the ability for adults and children to share inner thoughts and feelings and discuss past, present, and future events. With language, children transform their thinking about the world around them with new ways to label, organize, categorize and memorize. Furthermore, early language ability in toddlerhood is important not only for later  language  ability  but  also  for  cognitive  development  in  later  childhood.  This  section  will  provide  an  overview  of communication  and  language  development  during  the  first  three  years,  considering  acquisition  patterns  and  the  importance  of individual differences.\nThis page titled 11.1: Introduction is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "Communication & Language Concerns\nThe above chart represents averages of when infants and toddlers achieve various communication and language milestones. What about children who do not achieve these milestones by the ages listed? While children can indeed develop different abilities at different times, too great a delay in acquiring specific milestones can be a concern. The chart below is from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The chart adopts a proactive stance-we should take action early when developmental concerns arise rather than the perspective of waiting to see if a child 'catches up'. Again, while children do develop at their own pace, being proactive during these critical early years is essential as early recognition of delays and disabilities can lead to early intervention with the potential for greater positive outcomes (Caselli, Pyers & Lieberman, 2021; Fuller et al., 2020; Roberts & Kaiser, 2015). Caregivers should encourage parents to communicate with their family's pediatrician if children are not achieving milestones by the ages  listed  below.  Most  caregivers  are  not  professionally  trained  to  officially  assess  the  developmental  abilities  of  children; however, caregivers have the ability to track developmental progress and are often the first to notice developmental concerns.\n[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Eye Gaze\nInfants and toddlers learn language best through face-to-face interactions with their caregivers in social contexts, and face-to-face communication is inherently multimodal as it uses more than just speech to communicate (e.g., gestures, facial expressions, eye gaze, etc.,). Eye gaze is, in fact, a central element in human communication. Not only do adults often use social eye gaze when communicating with infants, but infants also show a sensitivity to, and preference for, eye gaze signals early on (Simpson et al., 2020). Newborns look longer at faces with open eyes than faces with closed eyes (Batki et al., 2000). They also prefer faces with direct gaze with which they can engage in mutual eye contact (Farroni, Johnson & Csibra, 2004). Infants begin developing gazefollowing abilities between 2 to 4 months, which become fairly stable by 6 to 8 months (D'Entremont et al., 1997; Gredeback et al., 2010).  Following  gaze  cues  becomes  almost  automatic,  with  adult's  gaze  direction  causing  fast  visual  attention  shifts  even  in infants as young as 3 months of age (Hood et al., 1998).\nFigure : Demonstration of Eye Gaze. ( ) 11.3.1 [1]\nThere is a strong association between infants' ability to follow an adult's gaze direction, and their later receptive and expressive vocabulary (Çetinçelik, Rowland & Snijders, 2020). Eye gaze, both in the form of eye contact and gaze following, may direct and help infants in sustaining their attention and thus learn about relevant information in the environment. For example, when an infant follows an adult's gaze to the sky toward an airplane overhead, the sounds produced by the airplane and the language the adult uses while communicating in the moment about the airplane can be more easily linked to the airplane itself. The use of eye gaze cues support infants' learning by highlighting the important information in the environment and channeling their attention to it.

    "context_enriched_content": "Language Acquisition\nChildren will typically go through the four stages of language acquisition.\n1. Pre-language stage (3 to 10 months) where a child makes a lot of 'cooing' and 'babbling';\n2. The holophrastic stage (12 to 18 months) where a child starts to comprehend a single unit of utterance like 'milk', 'eat', 'dad', 'brother';\n3. Two-word stage (18 to 20 months) where a child, through a process of acquiring two nouns or a noun and a verb (noun + verb), begins pairing two words together such as 'baby chair', 'mommy eat', 'cat bad';\n4. Telegraphic speech-stage (before 3 years old) defines a stage where a child puts some words together, even if the words are in the incorrect order.

    "context_enriched_content": "Vocal Development\nThe  quality  of  infants'  vocalizations  progresses  markedly  during  the  first  year  of  life.  From  birth,  infants  produce  reflexive vocalizations, such as cries, fusses, and vegetative noises (e.g., coughs, burps, sneezes), as well as prespeech (a.k.a. 'protophone') vocalizations (Buder, Warlaumont & Oller, 2013; Oller et al., 2009). Protophones are speech-like sounds including both canonical babbling  (consisting  of  canonical  syllables  such  as  'ba'  or  'da'  and  sequences,  'baba'  or  'dada'  and  so  on)  and  non-canonical babbling (e.g. squeals, growls and vowel-like sounds). Infants produce approximately 3,500 protophone vocalizations every day (Oller  et  al.,  2019).  Infants  begin  cooing  around  two  months  of  age.  By  three  months  of  age,  infants  typically  demonstrate  an expanded range of vocal types, such as raspberries, squeals, growls, full vowels, yells, and whispers (Buder, Warlaumont & Oller, 2013; Oller, 2000). Between four to six months of age, infants begin to produce single syllable babbling sounds (e.g., da, ba) and then combine these syllable sounds (e.g., dadada, bababa) between six-eight months of age. [1] [2]\nFigure : Example of vocalization. ( ) 11.5.1 [3]\nBabbling represents the specific sounds used in the language a child is exposed to. At around 7 months infants typically begin to demonstrate  canonical  babbling,  which  contains  both  consonants  and  vowels  with  swift  transitions  between  them.  Canonical babbling is considered speech-like and is a foundation for the first words that infants begin producing around the first birthday (Oller, 2000; Stoel-Gammon & Cooper, 1984). Cross-linguistic research shows that monolingual infants between 8 to 12 months of age begin to produce the characteristic intonation (Whalen, Levitt & Wang, 1991), syllable, and word-forms (Levitt & Utman, 1992; Levitt & Wang, 1991; Lleó, Prinz, El Mogharbel & Maldonado, 1996) of the specific language to which they are exposed, whether that be Spanish, Russian, Tagalog, a signed language or Arabic (Petitto & Marentette, 1991; Sundara, Ward, Conboy & Kuhl,  2020).  Interestingly,  frequency  of  early  infant  vocalizations  is  related  to  expressive  language  at  twelve  months  of  age (Lyakso, Frolova & Grigorev, 2014; Werwach, Mürbe, Schaadt & Männel, 2021). [1] [4]\nWhile infants' early vocalizations are important, it is the specific combination of infant vocalizations followed up by a caregiver response  that  is  the  strongest  predictor  of  language  growth  (Donnellan  et  al.,  2020).  When  caregivers  respond  to  infants' vocalization it creates a meaningful dyadic interaction that extends language learning. When caregivers do respond to the speechlike  vocalizations  from  infants,  infants  are  more  likely  to  produce  another  speech-like  vocalization,  creating  a  language-rich interactional  loop  (Warlaumont,  Richards,  Gilkerson  &  Oller,  2014)  that  is  positively  related  to  later  vocabulary  development (Lopez, Walle, Pretzer & Warlaumont, 2020).\nLopez  et  al.,  (2020).

    "context_enriched_content": "Gesturing\nInfants and toddlers use a variety of gestures to communicate. Gestures involve movements of the body, particularly the fingers, hands, and head, that are interpreted as a form of intentional communication (Iverson & Thal, 1998). Children most commonly produce  two  main  types  of  gestures-deictic  and  representational  (Iverson  &  Thal,  1998).  Deictic  gestures,  such  as  pointing, establish reference to indicate or call attention to something and can be used to indicate a wide range of meanings in the immediate environment (Bates, Camaioni, & Volterra, 1975). Infants start to use pointing gestures within the second half of their first year of life and usually before they begin talking. Infants may first use so called whole-hand points, in which the arm and the hand are extended toward a referent, followed by index-finger points, in which the arm and the index finger are clearly extended toward a referent (Lock et al., 1990; Liszkowski & Tomasello, 2011; Lüke et al., 2017). [1] [2]\nFigure : examples of whole hand pointing and index-finger pointing ( ) 11.6.1 [3]\nThe second main type of gestures, representational gestures, identify a referent and carry fixed semantic meaning. Representational gestures  may  include  (a)  culturally  defined  conventional  gestures  (e.g.,  shaking  head  for  ''no,''  waving  for  ''bye''),  (b)  iconic gestures  (e.g.,  moving  arms  in  the  air  to  represent  an  airplane  flying),  or  (c)  baby  signs,  which  involve  hand  movements deliberately taught by an adult (e.g., bringing the hands together and tapping the fingertips to indicate ''more''). Gestures provide infants  and  toddlers  a  way  to  refer  to  objects  and  events  as  they  are  developing  spoken  language,  and  provide  caregivers  an opportunity to contingently respond to and translate the child's gesture into words (Dimitrova et al., 2016). These bidirectional influences between caregivers and children help scaffold the development of communication and language (LeBarton & Iverson, 2017). [1]\nAlthough gestures can be a form of preverbal communication, the use of gestures continues to grow throughout toddlerhood, even with the onset and development of children's expressive language. Figure shows the number of gestures produced by a large group of Hebrew-speaking toddlers. At each month during the second year of life, some toddlers produce very few gestures, while others  produce  a  lot.  For  example,  at  nineteen  months  of  age,  the  median  is  around  forty  gestures  produced.  The  median  is  a midpoint, separating the top higher scores from the bottom lower scores. Therefore, this graph shows the large differences in the number of gestures toddlers produce, as some produced only around 30 gestures at nineteen months while others produced nearly twice as many. 11.6.2 [4]\nFigure : Number of gestures produced from a sample of 881 native Hebrew-speaking children in the second year of life. The results show that as age increased, the gap grew between toddlers ranked at the lowest and highest quantiles in terms of the number of words produced by each group. The gap between the number of words produced by toddlers in the 0.10 and the 0.90 quantiles at 12 months was 24 words, while the gap between the number of words produced by toddlers in the same quantiles at 24 months was 279 words ( ) 11.6.2 [4]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Gesture and Its Relation to Language Acquisition.\nEarly infant gestures are more than simple motor accomplishments-rather gestures are indicative of a dynamic, social process involving gradual transitions in the way in which infants engage with their physical environment and the people within it. Decades of  research  have  revealed  a  robust  correlation  between  gesture  use  and  the  later  development  of  receptive  language  (Rowe  & Goldin-Meadow, 2009; Rowe, Ozcaliskan, & Goldin-Meadow, 2008; Watt, Wetherby, & Shumway, 2006) and expressive language (Iverson & GoldinMeadow, 2005; Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009). Brooks and Meltzoff (2008) offer a potential explanation for the predictive power of early gestures for later language outcomes. They argue that pointing has a bidirectional function; it aids infants by providing them with a communicative tool, and it makes caregivers more likely to produce the labels that the toddler is pointing at, therefore fostering the infant's linguistic abilities. Furthermore, by gesturing, children can obtain and maintain attention of the adult, thereby establishing new language learning opportunities (Bates et al., 1979;Capone & McGregor, 2004). Pointing at the  beginning of the second year is related to the beginning of word comprehension and production, and it plays a key role in coordinating attention to persons, objects, and events with other people and to labels associated with them (Sansavini et al., 2010; Tomasello  et  al.,  2007).  Thus,  infants  who  point  less  frequently  may  have  fewer  opportunities  to  initiate  and  maintain  joint attention with their caregivers and to associate labels with their referents in daily interactions.

    "context_enriched_content": "Gesture and its Relation to Language Delay.\nIn  addition  to  gesture  being  positively  correlated  with  later  language  abilities,  gesture  is  also  indicative  of  children  with developmental  delays  and  disabilities.  Reduced  gesture  use  has  been  reported  in  toddlers  with  language  delays  early  in development (Hsu & Iyer, 2016; Iverson et al., 2018; Lüke et al., 2017; Manwaring et al., 2019). Language delay can be identified between 18 and 36 months in young children with limited  expressive  vocabularies,  equivalent  to  the  10th  percentile  or  below compared to normative values, and who are free from cognitive, neurological, socio-emotional, or sensory disabilities (Rescorla, 2011). Research suggests a lower rate of pointing in toddlerhood may be an early marker of language delay (Lüke et al., 2017; Sansavini et al., 2019). Lower production of communicative gestures between 18 and 28 months of age also distinguishes truly delayed  late  talkers  from  'late  bloomers'  (their  language  development  is  initially  delayed,  but  they  eventually  catch  up), highlighting  the  predictive  value  of  measures  of  gesture  use  for  later  expressive  language  skills  (Thal  &  Tobias,  1992).  Taken together, these findings underscore the relevance of gestures in the second year as a potential index of later language acquisition and delay. [1] [7]\nFigure : Toddler producing a gesture.

    "context_enriched_content": "Gesture and its Relation to Autism Spectrum Disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. Gesture deficits have been identified as one of the earliest social communication indicators of ASD (Iverson et al., 2018;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2006;  Yirmiya  &  Charman,  2010).  Young  children  with  ASD  may  demonstrate  particular  difficulty  with deictic  gestures  compared  to  typically  developing  toddlers  (LeBarton  &  Iverson,  2016;  Manwaring  et  al.,  2018;  Özçalişkan, Adamson, & Dimitrova, 2016). Studies of infants at increased genetic risk for ASD (due to having an older sibling diagnosed with ASD) indicate that reduced gesture use is present in infancy (Mitchell et al., 2006) and persists over time (Iverson et al., 2018) in infants  later  diagnosed  with  ASD.  There  is  emerging  evidence  showing  that  social-communication  skills  in  ASD  do  not  differ significantly from typical development during the first year of life, with identical outcomes for typically-developing and high-risk infants  who  go  on  to  receive  an  autism  diagnosis  (Rogers,  2009;  Elsabbagh  and  Johnson,  2016).  This  trajectory,  nevertheless, begins to diverge soon after, with a steady decline in the growth rates of both gesture and language production (Iverson et al., 2017) and a decline in social engagement in toddlers later diagnosed with ASD.

    "context_enriched_content": "What is Statistical Learning?\nBefore infants can successfully link appropriate sound sequences to their referents, they must determine the set of sounds within a speech stream that correspond to potential words. For example, infants must segment the auditory statement 'that is such a cute doggie' into meaningful chunks to accurately link it to its referent (e.g., 'doggie'). This ability to segment speech sounds into word-level  units,  termed  'word  segmentation,'  is  a  critical  part  of  the  word  learning  process  (Saffran  &  Kirkham,  2018). Successful word segmentation requires exposure to the patterns and probabilities of sound sequences, maintaining phonological working memory and the order of the sequence of phonemes within the stream of speech to track the transitional probability so that one can increasingly identify potential word boundaries. Infants, children, and adults are all skilled at statistical word segmentation, often referred to as 'statistical learning skills' (Aslin & Newport, 2012; Aslin, 2014; Saffran & Kirkham, 2018). [1]\nStatistical learning is the implicit ability to track regularities in linguistic or other input (e.g., visual or motor) and learn from the distributional information (Saffran, 2001; Lany & Saffran, 2013). The foundational statistical learning experiments in 8-month-old infants  demonstrated  that  young  infants  could  segment  speech  into  potential  word  units  using  transitional  probabilities  or  cooccurring  probability  information  between  syllables  (Saffran,  Aslin  &  Newport,  1996;  Aslin,  Saffran  &  Newport,  1998). Researchers have argued that the ability to learn from the patterns of language a child is exposed to plays an important role in language learning (Saffran, 2001, 2003). These studies suggest that during their first year, before children begin to produce words, they  start  learning  the  patterns  of  the  language  they  hear,  tracking  the  sound  combinations  that  correspond  to  potential  words. Furthermore, statistical word segmentation is one of the important aspects of word learning and vocabulary acquisition in toddlers. Eighteen-month-olds' ability to use statistical information derived from fluent speech to identify words within the stream of speech and then to map the words to meaning predicts vocabulary size at 24-months and vocabulary growth from 18 to 24 months (Ellis, Borovsky, Elman & Evans, 2021).

Despite tremendous individual variation in children's rate of development (Fenson et al., 2007), the first words that they utter are strikingly consistent (Schneider, Yurovsky, & Frank, 2015; Tardif et al., 2008): they tend to talk  about  important  people  in  their  life  ('mom,'  'dad'),  social  routines  ('hi,'  'uh-oh'),  animals  ('dog,'  'duck'),  and  foods ('milk,' 'banana'). Even as children learn from their own experiences and according to their own interests (Mayor & Plunkett, 2014;  Nelson,  1973),  their  vocabulary  grows  rapidly,  typically  adding  more  nouns,  but  also  verbs  ('go')  and  other  predicates ('hot') to their repertoires. Figure shows when the proportion of children between 10 to 30 months of age, across various languages, begin producing the word 'dog' and 'jump' in their native language.

The reality is that in between isolated stages and milestones, language is growing month by month (and even really day by day). In addition  to  presenting  language  milestones,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  the  month  by  month  growth  in  comprehension  and production in early language development. To illustrate what language growth looks like month by month over the first three years years, let's examine some data.\nWhen we talk with infants and toddlers, they can understand a lot, despite not yet being able to say much in return. Figure illustrates the month by month development of language comprehension in children from eight months to eighteen months of age. The 50th percentile lines indicate the median growth over time. The data shows a steep upward trajectory of growth. At 8 months of age, half of the infants did not understand more than 7 words.

The speed at which children are able to process language while comprehending it, is a critical aspect of language growth during toddlerhood. An experiment called the looking-while-listening (LWL) task has been used to measure language processing efficiency in children. Typically, in LWL tasks, children see a pair of images on a screen (e.g., a ball on the left side of the screen and a shoe on the right) while simultaneously listening to speech that refers to one of these images (e.g., 'Where's the ball?'). Children look towards the objects being named as their eye movements are monitored and are then coded offline to measure the speed with which children move their gaze to the correctly named pictures. [1]\nFigure :  Configuration  of  a  version  of  the  looking-while-listening  task  adapted  for  children  learning  American  Sign Language (ASL): A) shows the stimuli presented to the children and B) shows the configuration of the sentences. ( ) 11.11.1 [2]\nThe large body of research using this task has revealed important discoveries:\n1. Maturational improvement . Language development involves more than the ability to understand or express single wordschildren need to be able to efficiently process streams of language in real-time. Over toddlerhood, children are consistently improving in their ability to rapidly and efficiently process language in real-time (Fernald, Perfors & Marchman, 2006; Fernald et al., 1998; MacDonald et al., 2018).\n2. Individual differences . While all children improve in their language processing efficiency over time, there are important individual differences early on. Children who have larger expressive vocabularies and who are exposed to more child-directed language are more efficient at processing language in real-time (Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2008; MacDonald et al., 2018; Marchman et al., 2017; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Already by eighteen months of age, children from higher SES backgrounds had larger vocabularies and faster response times in the LWL task and by twenty four months of age, there was a six month gap in language processing efficiency ability between children from low and high SES backgrounds (Fernald, Marchman & Weisleder, 2013). Late talking toddlers with more efficient language processing skills at eighteen months of age were more likely to 'bloom', showing greater increases in language ability at thirty months of age (Fernald & Marchman, 2012).\n3. Links to later abilities . Early language processing abilities are associated not just with language outcomes later in childhood, but also cognitive outcomes as well. Amongst preterm toddlers, those who were more efficient at processing language at eighteen months scored higher on language and IQ tests at fifty-four months of age (Marchman et al., 2018). In a group of children followed longitudinally, language processing at twenty-five months was associated with language and cognitive outcomes at eight years of age (Marchman & Fernald, 2008). One hypothesis for why more efficient language processing leads to these outcomes is that faster processing of familiar words frees up cognitive resources that can then be dedicated to the learning of new words (Fernald & Marchman 2012).

The quantity and quality of language exposure from caregivers is positively associated with toddlers' language growth. Toddlers who heard more child-directed language from caregivers at 18 to 19 months of age, had larger vocabularies and were more efficient at processing language when they were two years of age (Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2008; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). It is important to emphasize that it was child-directed language that was most significant, not language that was simply overheard. This research suggests that caregivers should engage in meaningful back-and-forth conversations with infants and toddlers as they increase the quantity and quality of language children are exposed to, especially child-directed language.\n2.

    "context_enriched_content": "Conclusion of Overview of Language Development\nBefore children can produce their first word, the process of acquiring a language is already well underway as infants use eye gaze, gestures  and  vocalizations  to  communicate.  Research  has  identified  acquisition  patterns,  which  has  helped  in  the  creation  of milestone charts. Milestones reveal the patterns of language development and help caregivers notice if a child's delay should lead to  a  conversation  with  a  specialist.  While  there  are  general  language  patterns,  there  are  also  important  individual  differences throughout the acquisition process. Despite all we now know, observing children acquiring language is still an amazing experience to behold. Learning how to best support and encourage language development is critical as language experience during the first three years is a foundation for language and cognitive abilities later in childhood (Gilkerson et al., 2018).\nThis page titled 11.12: Conclusion is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

Despite  years  of  practice, enrollment  in  language  classes,  books,  videos,  and  countless  resources,  etc.,  learning  a  language  as  an  adult  is  difficult!  Now imagine what learning a language must be like for an infant. Infants do not enroll in language classes, do not have access to various help  resources,  and  do  not  have  the  wealth  of  previous  knowledge  you  do  as  an  adult.  So  how  do  infants  acquire  language? Language theories attempt to explain the 'how' behind language acquisition. This section presents some of the main theories that have been proposed to explain how infants and toddlers acquire language.\nThis page titled 12.1: Introduction is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "Behaviorism and Language Acquisition\nYou  might  recall  the  theory  of  behaviorism  from  an  introductory  child  development  or  psychology  course  you  have  taken. Behaviorism is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals' observable behaviors- changes in what people say or do. In terms of language acquisition, behaviorism might make note of the developmental changes in early non-language communication  (i.e.,  eye  gaze,  gesture,  and  vocalization)  or  the  changes  in  language  development  as  children  accumulate increasing vocabularies and then begin combining words. These are all aspects of language development that can be observed.\nTo explain how these developments in language acquisition actually take place, behaviorists applied many of the same ideas that they used to understand how children learn in general. For example, behaviorists proposed that one way children learn is through operant  conditioning.  B.F.  Skinner  believed  that  behavior  is  motivated  by  the  consequences  we  receive  for  the  behavior:  the reinforcements and punishments. Operant conditioning focuses on how the consequences of a behavior affect the behavior over time. It begins with the idea that certain consequences tend to make certain behaviors happen more frequently. For example, when an infant vocalizes through cooing or babbling, the result will likely be an adult who turns toward the infant with attention, makes eye  contact  and  responds  with  engaged  infant-directed  language.  Thus,  as  a  reward  for  vocalizing,  the  infant  receives  adult attention and infant-directed language--a highly desired type of communication for infants! With a great gift like this, the infant is very likely to vocalize again in the hope to receive the same gift next time. Indeed, research has found that the more responsive caregivers are when interacting with infants and toddlers, the earlier they will achieve language milestones (Masek et al., 2021; Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein & Baumwell, 2001). Through operant conditioning children also receive rewards for using language in a functional manner. For example, a behaviorist might suggest that children learn to say the word 'drink' when they are thirsty because after doing so they receive something to drink, which reinforces their use of the word for getting a drink.

    "context_enriched_content": "Nativism and Language Acquisition\nNativism suggests that infants are born with an innate ability to acquire language that is hardwired in human brains. The linguist Noam Chomsky, the most well-known nativist, argued that human brains contain a language acquisition device (LAD) that includes a  universal grammar that underlies all human language (Chomsky, 1965, 1972). Chomsky proposed that children are born with knowledge of general grammatical rules so that with exposure, children are able to acquire language rapidly and with relative ease. The idea is  that  each  of  the  many  languages  used  around  the  world  has  the  same  underlying  set  of  grammatical  rules  that  are hardwired  into  human  brains--a  'universal  grammar'.  Chomsky  (1959)  rebutted  behaviorism's  argument  on  several  grounds. Chomsky  argued  that  it  was  unlikely  that  parents  were  doing  the  slow  and  careful  shaping  of  children's  vocalizations  that behaviorism proposed. According to Chomsky, language develops as long as the infant is exposed to it. No additional teaching, training, or reinforcement is required for language to develop. [1] [2]\nFigure : Noam Chomsky. ( ) 12.3.1 [3]\n1. All human languages share certain properties.\n2. Children are exposed to different inputs yet still converge on the same grammar.\n3. Children know things about language which they could not have learned from the input available to them. This is the most famous, and most powerful, argument for universal grammar.\n4. Humans are the only species that has language.\n5. Children learn language quickly and effortlessly, on minimal exposure.\n6. All children acquiring language go through the same stages in the same order.\n7. Different brain circuits are responsible for representing/processing linguistic and non-linguistic information.\nThere is general agreement among experts that babies are genetically programmed to learn language. In fact, fetuses have already begun their language acquisition journey while they are still in the womb (DeCasper & Spence, 1986; Ghio, Cara & Tettamanti, 2021; Moon, Lagercrantz & Kuhl, 2013)! Additionally, children are born ready to acquire any language they are exposed to, even languages of an entirely different modality (spoken modality versus a signed modality), such as a American Sign Language (Krentz & Corina, 2008;   Stone, Petitto & Bosworth, 2018). Neuroscience continues to document the innate brain mechanisms that support language acquisition in infants (Friederici, 2017; Friederici & Wartenburger, 2010; Kuhl, 2010; Perani, et al., 2011). Nevertheless, there is still debate about Chomsky's idea that there is a universal grammar that can account for all language learning. Evans and Levinson  (2009)  surveyed  the  world's  languages  and  found  that  none  of  the  presumed  underlying  features  of  the  language acquisition device were entirely universal. In their search they found languages that did not have noun or verb phrases, that did not have tenses (e.g., past, present, future), and even some that did not have nouns or verbs at all, even though a basic assumption of a universal  grammar  is  that  all  languages  should  share  these  features.  Another  limitation  to  the  nativist  theory  is  their  lack  of acknowledgement of the role of social interactions and cultural contexts in language acquisition. In summary, most experts agree that children are born primed to acquire language; however, the role of social interactions and the effect various contexts can have on the acquisition process is undeniable.

Once language does emerge it is usually within a specific sequence of stages that is universal in most children (Goodluck, 1991). The common progression through these language stages suggests that language is developing alongside other cognitive abilities. For example, infants and toddlers typically go through four stages of language acquisition:\n1. Pre-language stage (3 to 10 months) where a child makes a lot of 'cooing' and 'babbling';\n2. The holophrastic stage (12 to 18 months) where a child starts to comprehend a single unit of utterance like 'milk', 'eat', 'dad', 'brother';\n3. Two-word stage (18 to 20 months) where a child, through a process of acquiring two nouns or a noun and a verb (noun + verb), begins pairing two words together such as 'baby chair', 'mommy eat', 'cat bad';\n4. Telegraphic speech-stage (before 3 years old) defines a stage where a child puts some words together, even if the words are in the incorrect order. It has a similar meaning as a sentence, such as 'cookie I want', 'toy me fall', but is not a complete sentence. [1]\nJean Piaget is famous for his four stages of cognitive development. He believed that children do not think like adults and so before they  can  begin  to  develop  language  they  must  first  actively  construct  their  own  understanding  of  the  world  through  their interactions  with  the  environment.  A  child  has  to  understand  a  concept  before  they  can  acquire  the  particular  language  which expresses that concept. For example, a child first becomes aware of a concept such as a 'cat' and only afterward do they acquire the words to convey that concept. Essentially it is impossible for a young child to voice concepts that are cognitively unknown to them; therefore, a child must first learn about their environment, then they can connect language to their prior experiences. [1]\nPiaget's cognitive theory states that children's language reflects the development of their logical thinking and reasoning skills in stages. In this way, Piaget's stages reflect the primary role cognitive development has over language development and also reflects how  language  develops  overtime  as  a  child's  cognitive  development  progresses  through  each  stage.  Infants  and  toddlers  are included in the first two stages of Piaget's theory. These stages are most often discussed in reference to cognitive development. Their connection with language development will be explained below. [1]"

Initially, language is limited to infants because they must first experience the world and develop mental schemas as a way to represent these experiences. The first words that infants produce are strikingly consistent as they tend to talk about important people in their life ('mom,' 'dad'), social routines ('hi,' 'uh-oh'), animals ('dog,' 'duck'), and foods ('milk,' 'banana') (Schneider, Yurovsky, & Frank, 2015; Tardif et al., 2008). From a cognitive theorist perspective, this makes sense because these first words represent schemas that infants have been able to consistently develop and reinforce, due to high frequency exposure. In other words, infants' first words are for concepts they have strong cognitive representations for. [2]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Interactionist/Social Theory of Language Acquisition\nThe interactionist/social theory proposes that language exists for the purpose of communication and can only be learned in the context  of  interaction  with  adults  and  other  children.  It  stresses  the  importance  of  the  environment  and  culture  in  which  the language is being learned. Interactionists acknowledge the presence of innate biological mechanisms, but emphasize the critical role of social interactions (Jensen & Arnett, 2017; Levine & Munsch, 2018). Lev Vygotsky is the most well-known interactionist theorist and provided a theoretical framework for other interactionists to further develop theories of language acquisition. [1]\nInfluenced by the work of Vygotsky, Jerome Bruner believed that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the development of cognition in general and language in particular. Whereas Chomsky focused on innate mechanisms of language acquisition such as the idea of a language acquisition device (LAD), Bruner proposed the language acquisition support system (LASS) in opposition to Chomsky (Bakhurst & Shanker, 2001). The LASS refers to the social and cultural experiences that support and encourage language acquisition. This includes child-directed language exposure (e.g., parentese, dialogic reading, etc.,) as well as the various activities children engage in while also receiving exposure to language. Whereas the LAD emphasizes that children come into the world programmed ready to learn language, the LASS emphasizes that it is the world that is ready to expose and support children in learning language. [2]\nFigure : Caregiver interacting with an infant. . ( ) 12.5.1 [3]\nA powerful argument for the critical role of social interaction and not just language exposure in general, comes from the body of research comparing language learning from live interactions versus pre-recorded exposure played from a screened device. Toddlers who hear a new word uttered by a speaker on a recorded video are less likely to learn that word than those who hear the same word from an in-person speaker (Krcmar et al., 2007; Krcmar, 2010; Kuhl, Tsao & Liu, 2003; Roseberry et al., 2014; Troseth et al., 2018). Although language learning from video occurs in some situations (e.g., Scofield et al., 2007; Linebarger and Vaala, 2010; Vandewater, 2011), when learning from video is directly compared to learning from face-to-face interactions, toddlers usually learn better  from  an  actual  event  or  person  who  is  present.  Even  when  language  is  presented  through  a  screen,  infants  demonstrate greater language learning when two or more infants are present together (Lytle, Garcia-Sierra & Kuhl, 2018). To explain what is missing from video, Patricia Kuhl and her colleagues (2003) proposed that interpersonal social cues offered in a face-to-face setting 'attract  infants'  attention  and  motivate  learning'  and  that  the  presence  of  a  person  allows  the  sharing  of  'information  that  is referential in nature' (Kuhl, 2007). A speaker's communicative intentions may be less clear when offered on video, and the parts of language may be more challenging to extract. [4]\nFigure : Caregiver holding an infant. ( ) 12.5.1 [5]\nThe interactionist approach can also help explain how differences in the quantity and quality of language exposure affect a child's language development. The contexts that children are raised in  can  be  very  different  and  the  differences  in  language  exposure across  various  contexts  should  be  emphasized  when  considering  how  children  acquire  language  (Rowe  &  Weisleder,  2020)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Statistical Learning Theory of Language Acquisition\nThe natural environment presents infants with multiple streams of information occurring simultaneously. They encounter many objects, some moving, some stationary; they hear sounds, some language-related, others from animals and objects; they see people, some interacting with them, others in the background. Despite all of this information, these experiences are not completely random, there are predictable patterns that occur together. An infant's surroundings contain statistical regularities that they can use to detect structure in a busy environment. Infants are able to detect regularities and co-occurrences in visual shape sequences and visual scenes (Fiser & Aslin, 2002; Kirkham et al., 2002, 2007). For example, take a look at Figure ,  which shows three object clusters,  each  cluster  is  composed  of  three  colored  shapes.  Can  you  spot  the  regularity  that  co-occurs  across  the  three  object clusters? Although the three object clusters are not exactly the same, the regularity that occurs across all three are the yellow and pink connected shapes. In one study (Wu et al., 2011), 9-month-old infants were shown sequences involving these same threeshape object clusters in which two pieces always co-occurred and one piece constantly changed. They found that infants could keep track of which pieces co-occurred, suggesting that infants were able to track the statistical regularities they experience. 12.6.1 [1]\nFigure : Sample of stimuli from an infant statistical learning task. ( ) 12.6.1 [2]\nJust as infants are able to track regularities in the visual environment, they are also able to track the regularities that naturally occur in language. When we talk, we produce a consistent stream of speech sounds. An important task for an infant is to figure out which specific set of sounds within a speech stream go together to create words. One way infants do this is by tracking the statistical regularities of speech sounds that co-occur together. To demonstrate this, a research study (Antovich & Graf Estes, 2018) had 14 month olds listen to a speech stream consisting of four made up words: timay, dobu, kuga, pimo. While listening, the children heard each of the four words repeated 120 times, but the order of the words was mixed up. Despite the random presentation of words in a consistent  speech  stream,  there  were  regularities  of  sounds  that  always  co-occurred.  For  example,  'ti'  was  always  followed  by 'may'  (the  two  syllables  in  the  word  'timay'),  and  'pi'  always  co-occurred  with  'mo'  (the  two  syllables  in  the  word  'pimo'). However, as the order of the words was mixed up, the last syllable of a word and the first syllable of the next consecutive word occurred much less frequently as 'may' (the last syllable in the word 'timay') could be followed up by either of the other three words at any time. The results revealed that even though the words used were made up, the infants were able to track the statistical regularities and segment the words from the continuous speech stream. This research study, along with many others (for a review, see  Romberg  &  Saffran,  2010),  demonstrates  that  infants  are  able  to  track  the  statistical  regularities  of  the  language  they  are exposed to and this helps them in the initial stages of acquiring their native language(s)."

Detecting visual statistical regularities has even been documented in newborns (Bulf et al., 2011).

In this way, young infants are 'citizens of the world' (Kuhl, 2004) because they are able to phonetically distinguish between the sounds of all the world's languages and acquire any language they are exposed to. Phonetics refers to how the sounds in a language are made and what they actually sound like. Infants are very good at noticing phonetic differences, and they can tell the difference between all kinds of different sounds from many different languages. But this ability  changes  within  the  first  year  of  life.  To  acquire  a  language,  infants  must  be  able  to  discover  which  specific  phonetic distinctions  will  be  utilized  in  their  native  language.  The  early  ability  of  young  infants  to  phonetically  distinguish  between  the sounds of different languages begins to diminish as repeated exposure to one's native language leads to infants becoming 'culturebound listeners', now only able to distinguish the sounds in their native language (Kuhl, 2004). For example, at six months of age, English-learning babies are about 80-90% successful at noticing phonetic differences in English, in Hindi, and in Salish (Werker & Tees, 1984). But by ten months of age, their success rate drops to about 50-60%, and by the time they are one year old, they are only about 10-20% successful at hearing the phonetic differences in Hindi and Salish. The theory of NLM-e explains the narrowing of infant speech perception and the subsequent growth of native language abilities. [1] [2]\nNLM-e  proposes  that  young  infants'  universal  early  speech  perception  ability  narrows  with  language  experience  as  the  brain neurally commits to the child's native language, thereby fostering the language acquisition process. There are five basic principles of NLM-e (Kuhl et al., 2008):"

    "context_enriched_content": "Distributional patterns and infant-directed language are agents of change.\nIn order to comprehend language infants first have to acquire the sound inventory of a given language, that is, learn how many and which speech sounds are functionally distinct units. When a caregiver talks with an infant, what the infant hears is a long strand of continuous language sounds. How does an infant learn the individual words within a speech stream? One of the mechanisms they use is distributional learning, which refers to learning by simply listening to the frequency distributions of the speech sounds in language. Different languages have different distributional sound patterns, as some sounds are more likely to frequently be heard together than others. Infants as young as 2 months of age are sensitive to the distributional sound patterns in language (Maye, Werker,  &  Gerken,  2002;  Wanrooij,  Boersma,  &  van  Zuijen,  2014).  As  research  suggests  distributional  learning  is  one  of  the mechanisms by which infants start to acquire the phonemes of their native language, NLM-e includes it as an important agent of change. When adult caregivers talk with infants and toddlers, they tend to use a different speech style, often referred to as infantdirected speech, that includes higher pitch, greater pitch range, and longer pauses between words, (Fernald et al.,1989; Outters et al., 2020). Infants prefer to listen to infant-directed speech over adult-directed speech at birth (Cooper & Aslin, 1990), as well as later in infancy (Fernald, 1985; Werker & McLeod, 1989). When listening to infant-directed speech, compared to adult-directed speech, infants are better able to discriminate speech sounds (Karzon, 1985; Trainor & Desjardins, 2002), more efficiently segment words from continuous speech (Thiessen, Hill & Saffran, 2005), demonstrate better long-term memory for words (Singh et al., 2009),  and  learn  new  words  more  effectively  (Graf  Estes  &  Hurley,  2013;  Ma  et  al.,  2011).  As  a  result,  NLM-e  proposes  that infant-directed speech is an agent of change because it helps infants phonetically discriminate language sounds as well as helps them acquire their native language.

For example, infants' speech perception abilities change with as little as 5 hours of exposure to a second language (Kuhl et al., 2003; Conboy & Kuhl, 2011) and remain changed even a month after exposure has been discontinued (Sundara et al., 2020).

Through vocalization, infants relate the articulatory properties they use to create various sounds, to the sounds they hear themselves produce and then relate that to the language sounds they have mapped out from adult language exposure.

    "context_enriched_content": "Individuality of Language Growth\nLanguage develops rapidly during the first three years of life. Figure shows growth curves for the development of toddlers' productive vocabulary between 16 to 30 months of age. On the x-axis is the age of children and the y-axis represents how many words children produce. Each gray dot is a child's data. When you look at this chart closely, what do you notice? Did you notice the individual differences within each age? For example, look at the spread of dots at 24 months. Even within the same age, 24 months, there is a large variability in productive vocabulary between children. At 24 months, some children have been heard to speak more than 500 or even 600 words, while many others spoke less than 200 words. Also, notice that the growth curves suggest that  these  individual  differences  start  early,  before  16  months  and  continue  throughout  the  second  year  of  life.  Where  do  these individual differences in language ability come from and do they have any long term significance? 13.2.1\nFigure :  Growth  curves  for  the  number  of  words  children  produce.  Table  with  all  data  points  can  be  found  Wordbank  | Analyses (stanford.edu) ( ) 13.2.1 [1]\nEarly individual differences in language ability does have long term significance. For example, individual differences in language processing  abilities  remain  stable  across  development GLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif> those  children  who  were  faster  at  processing  language  at  19  months continued to be faster at processing language 12 months later (Peter et al., 2019). For children born prematurely, children who were faster at processing language at 18 months, had larger vocabulary comprehension abilities at 30 months (Marchman et al., 2016) and  had  higher  scores  on  language  and  IQ  at  54  months  (Marchman  et  al.,  2018).  By  18  months,  children  from  higher  SES backgrounds already have larger productive vocabularies and are more efficient at processing language (Fernald, Marchman & Weisleder, 2013). When these same children were followed up six months later, those with larger vocabularies and more efficient language processing skills  at  18  months  continued  to  perform  at  a  higher  level:  at  two  years  of  age,  children  from  lower  SES backgrounds performed at the level children from higher SES backgrounds did when they were 18 months oldGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>representing a six month performance gap by age two. [2]\nIn summary, individual differences in language ability begin to form early in life and have the potential to lead to very different developmental  outcomes  later  in  childhood.  Specifically,  larger  vocabularies  and  more  efficient  language  processing  skills  in toddlerhood is related to higher performance on language, cognitive and academic assessments in later childhood. Clearly early individual differences in language ability are important, but where do they come from?"

    "context_enriched_content": "The Word Gap\nThe individual differences in language abilities that appear early in the first three years can be partly explained by the various levels of language exposure children recieve. For example, early language processing abilities are associated with the amount of language children hear as research has found that children who are exposed to less language tend to have lower language abilities (Fernald & Weisleder, 2010; Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2008). [3]\nFigure : Caregiver interacting with a toddler. ( ) 13.2.2 [4]\nIn one important study on individual differences, researchers went into families' homes once per month and recorded what children heard and said for one hour (Hart & Risley, 1995). They started doing this when the infants were nine months old, and they kept going to their homes every month until the children were three years old. During this time, the toddlers began to talk, and the scientists tracked every new word that they produced. They also wrote down all the words and sentences that parents said to their children.  After  analyzing  these  recordings,  they  found  that  most  children  started  speaking  around  their  first  birthday,  but  some learned new words much more quickly than others did. They also found that children were better at learning new words if their parents talked to them a lot at home. Children who heard lots of language-more words, more different words, more questions, more encouraging words, and more words that described things-had bigger vocabularies than children who did not hear as much language. [5]\nOne  important  finding  from  this  study  was  that  children  heard  more  language  if  they  were  from  families  with  a  higher socioeconomic status (SES). This relationship between family (SES) and the amount of words spoken to the child has become known as the word gap. Hart and Risley (2003) estimated that there is a 30 million word gapGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>children from higher SES families are exposed to 30 million more words by age three than children from families with a lower SES. While some researchers argue that the actual word gap may be less than the 30 million words originally proposed, the word gap is nonetheless present and impactful, as  numerous  studies  have  documented  a  difference  in  language  exposure  based  on  family  SES  (Ellwood-Lowe,  Foushee  & Srinivasan, 2022; Hoff, 2003; Huttenlocher et al., 2010; Golinkoff et al., 2019; Rowe, Leech & Cabrera, 2017). For example, the language of parents with a lower SES often use a lower diversity of words in comparison to the language of parents with a higher SES (Burchinal et al., 2008; Huttenlocher et al., 2010). As a consequence of these input differences, children with a higher SES background  often  have  a  larger  vocabulary  (Gilkerson  et  al.,  2017;  Hoff,  2006)  and  more  often  use  diverse  and  advanced grammatical constructions than children from lower SES families (Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Cymerman & Levine, 2002). [6]\nThe idea of a word gap highlights the importance of early language exposure for positive long term developmental trajectories. Early language experiences and abilities lead to stronger later language performance and are even related to later cognitive and academic abilities (Bornstein, Hahn, Putnick & Pearson, 2018; Lehrl et al., 2020; Rodriguez & Tamis-LeMonda, 2011; Rose, Lehrl,\nEbert & Weinert, 2018; Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2019). For example toddlers with larger vocabularies and more efficient language processing demonstrated stronger language and cognitive skills at 8 years of age (Marchman & Fernald, 2008)."

In one study, researchers looked at the potential factors in language growth across a group of toddlers, all from families with a low SES (Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Children wore a special recorder that captured the language they were exposed to throughout the day, over multiple days. Results revealed great variability in language exposure, even though the children were all from families with lower SES. Figure charts the varied language exposure of the children. Each colored column represents one child and the height of the column represents the number of words a child heard in a 10 hour dayGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>the taller the bar, the more words heard by a child. Some children heard over 25,000 words in one day, while others heard under 2,500 words in one day. This is data from just one day, but imagine the compounding effect this has over the first three years of a child's life if these daily patterns are repeated! 13.2.3 [5]\nFigure : Number of words toddlers, from low SES families, heard in one day. Each bar represents one child's level of word exposure. There are total of 28 bars on this graph, for 28 different children. This graph shows the number of words that different kids heard from grownups in 1 day. The bottom section/green part of each bar shows the number of words that grownups said to that kid in 1 day. The top/blue part of each bar shows the number of words that kids overheard when grownups were talking to other people. For example, kid 2 heard 2,500 words total. 2,000 words are directed to her, and 500 words are overheard. Child 23 hears 20,000 words total. 2,000 words are directed to her, 18,000 words are overheard. Child 27 hears 21,000 words total. 15,000 words are directed to her, 6,000 words are overheard. ( 13.2.3 [7]\nThese results move the spotlight away from SES per se and instead shine it more specifically on the variable language experiences of children, one of which can include SES. In general, children from families with high SES hear more language than children from families with low SES, but even within the same SES level there are significant differences in language experience. There are also other reasons besides SES for wide-ranging levels of language exposure. For example, in Senegal, cultural traditions and beliefs discourage caregivers from talking with infants and toddlers, therefore greatly restricting their language exposure (Weber, Fernald & Diop, 2017). Other research shows that the quantity of words infants experience varies greatly based on how infants are placed during activities and the type of activity. Infants placed in sitting devices (e.g., bouncy seats, highchairs) experience fewer adult words and less consistent language exposure throughout the day (Malachowski, Salo, Needham & Humphreys, 2021). Considering various  daily  activities,  infants  were  exposed  to  the  most  words  during  book  sharing  (mean  of  55.91  words  per  minute)  and grooming (mean of 56.60 words per minute) and the least amount of words during object play (mean of 34.10 words per minute) and feeding (mean of 32.44 words per minute) (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2019).\nUntil now we have learned that the number of words children are exposed to can vary greatly depending on factors such as SES and culture, but what does the 'typical' amount of language exposure look like? To estimate how many words infants and toddlers hear across different ages, another team of researchers also used small language recorders worn by children to count the number of words infants and toddlers heard throughout the day (Gilkerson et al., 2017). Figure summarizes some of their data. Take a moment to look carefully at the data in Figure . What did you notice? Consider how developmental growth in other domains, such as motor abilities, might influence the amount of words children hear. 13.2.4 13.2.4"

Why do you think infants and younger toddlers are exposed to more words than older toddlers? Across 2 to 36 months of  age,  children  are  approximately  exposed  to  an  average  amount  of  words  between  the  range  of  12,000  to  just  over  15,000. Although the difference between 12,000 and 15,000 may not seem very significant, consider how these numbers could play out over just one year. A child who is exposed to 12,000 words everyday for one year would hear 4,380,000 words, but a child exposed to 15,000 words daily would hear 5,475,000 words in one year. This represents a difference of over one million words!\nIt is critical to stress that while this data was recorded in the child's home environment as families moved throughout their daily routines in an attempt to capture 'natural' language exposure, the data in no way should be interpreted as representing what may be 'typical' language exposure for all children. The participants in the study were all monolingual English speaking children, mostly (66%) white, all from the Denver, Colorado area and educated with a high school GED (26%), some college experience (29%) and a  college  degree  (23%).  Irrespective  of  these  limitations,  the  data  does  provide  intriguing  insight  into  daily  natural  language exposure for infants and toddlers."

    "context_enriched_content": "Quality of Language Exposure\nWhile quantity, the sheer amount of language children are exposed to, is clearly important, research suggests the quality of the exposure is even more important (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015; Romeo et al., 2018). Let's revisit the chart that showed the number of words  toddlers,  from  low  SES  families,  heard  in  one  day  (see  Figure ).  While  the  height  of  the  columns  represents  the quantity of language exposure, the colored sections of the columns represent the quality of exposure. Some children heard lots of language spoken directly to them, like when they were talking and playing with their caregivers, this is referred to as child-directed speech. The bottom color of each column is green, representing the amount of words heard that were child-directed. Other children heard lots of language that was not directed to them, like when their caregivers were talking to each other or to other children nearby, this is referred to as overheard speech. The top color of each column is blue, representing the amount of overheard words. 13.2.5 [8]\nFigure : Number of words toddlers, from low SES families, heard in one day. Each bar represents one child's level of word exposure. There are total of 28 bars on this graph, for 28 different children. This graph shows the number of words that different kids heard from grownups in 1 day. The bottom section/green part of each bar shows the number of words that grownups said to that kid in 1 day.

( ) [5]\nDistinguishing between the quantity of language children are exposed to is critical. The research revealed that the toddlers who heard more child-directed language had bigger vocabularies and had more efficient language processing abilities than the children who did not hear as much child-directed speech. This shows that the quality of the words caregivers use with infants and toddlers, such as child-directed speech, may be even more important than the overall quantity of language exposure.\nChild-directed language is just one way to think about the quality of language infants and toddlers experience. Another way to perceive  language  quality  is  through  the  conversational  turn  counts  between  children  and  adults.  Turn  counts  are  an  important quality  measure  because  they  capture  the  critical  interactive  and  responsive  aspect  of  a  back-and-forth  conversation.  After controlling for SES, toddlers who experienced more conversational turn counts with caregivers had higher IQ scores and language abilities later in childhood at ages 9 and 13 (Gilkerson et al., 2018).\nFigure : Caregiver holding a toddler. ( ) 13.2.6 [9]\nThere are important early differences in the quantity and quality of language that infants and toddlers experience above and beyond SES.  Research  has  found  that  both  quantity  and  quality  of  language  exposure  during  the  first  three  years  of  life  is  related  to language  and  cognitive  abilities  in  later  childhood.  While  caregivers  should  consider  increasing  the  quantity  of  language  their infants and toddlers experience, focusing on various quality aspects of their language interactions is the most important. The next session will introduce various strategies that caregivers can use to improve the quantity and quality of the language they share with infants and toddlers."

    "context_enriched_content": "Responsiveness and Sensitivity\nResponsiveness  refers  to  a  caregiver's  ability  to  detect  and  respond  to  a  child's  behavioral  signals  during  shared  interactions (Landry et al.,  2001).  Sensitivity  refers  to  caregivers  who  are  aware  and  capable  of  understanding  a  child's  behaviors  and  that respond  to  the  child's  needs  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner  (Grossmann,  Bretherton,  Waters  &  Grossmann,  2013).  Thus responsiveness  and  sensitivity  are  related  constructs  that  when  implemented,  support  the  language  development  of  infants  and toddlers (Alvarenga et al., 2021; Madigan et al., 2019). [1]\nFigure : Caregiver responding to an infant's interest. ( ) 13.3.1.1 [2]\nInfants and toddlers benefit from interacting with responsive and sensitive caregivers. For example, removing social feedback from interactions  between  caregivers  and  infants  leads  to  fewer  vocalizations  from  5-month-old  infants  (Goldstein,  Schwade  & Bornstein,  2009),  while  providing  social  feedback  in  response  to  8  month  olds'  vocalizations  results  in  a  higher  number  of vocalizations  (Goldstein,  King  &  West,  2003).  One  study  found  that  when  children  were  9  and  13  months  old  caregivers' responsiveness predicted when children reached various language milestones, such as when children produced their first words and first fifty words (Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein & Baumwell, 2001). Both caregiver responsiveness and sensitivity are related to the development of expressive language abilities in toddlers (Bruce, Panneton & Taylor, 2022; Prime, Wade & Gonzalez, 2020) and higher  levels  of  caregiver  sensitivity  during  infancy  are  related  to  greater  abilities  in  language  comprehension  in  toddlerhood (Baumwell, Tamis-LeMonda & Bornstein, 1997). [3] [4]\nTo  support  language  development,  caregivers  should  participate  in  training  sessions  that  practice  and  improve  their  ability  to provide responsive and sensitive care and interactions with infants and toddlers. When caregivers do receive such training, their responsiveness improves and is linked to an improvement in communication abilities of infants (Alvarenga et al., 2021). Engaging in responsive and sensitive interactions not only takes practice, but also uninterrupted focused time with children. To be responsive, a caregiver must pay close attention to a child's signals and to be sensitive, a caregiver must respond to their signals in a timely and appropriate way.\n[1]\nCaldas et al., (2018).

    "context_enriched_content": "Turn-taking\nInfants spend much of their awake time in face-to-face interactions with their caregivers and it is this face-to-face conversational setting that provides an important context for infants to start acquiring language. Additionally, before infants acquire language they start to interact in social exchanges with caregivers characterized by turn-taking patterns, such as peek-a-boo games and give and take interactional sequences (Bates, Camaioni & Volterra, 1975; Ratner & Bruner, 1978; Rochat, Querido & Striano, 1999). These mutually  engaged  interactions  can  consist  of  behaviors  in  multiple  modalities  such  as  vocalizations,  gazes  and  smiles. Conversational  turn-taking  is  important  during  infancy  as  it  lays  the  foundation  for  the  flow  and  pattern  of  interactions,  but continues to be important throughout toddlerhood and the preschool years as the amount of turn-taking children and caregivers engage in is related to language development and brain function (Donnelly & Kidd, 2021; Romeo et al., 2018, 2021). [1]\n[2]\nFigure : Caregiver and an infant engaged in a face-to-face turn-taking interaction ( 13.3.2.1\nThere are many ways caregivers can engage in turn-taking with children. Questions are a common way to start back-and-forth conversations  (Gilkerson  et  al.,  2018;  Rowe,  Leech  &  Cabrera,  2017).  Questions  can  have  many  formats  (Wasik  &  Hindman, 2013), including open (involving no single correct answer and likely requiring multiple word response) or closed (single correct answer),  with  the  latter  including  label  questions  (What's  this  called?)  or  yes/no  questions  (Is  this  a  dog?).  There  is  extensive evidence that questions in the classroom are a powerful tool for eliciting child language and fostering conversation. Open-ended questions  may  be  relatively  rare,  representing  approximately  only  5%  of  caregivers'  prompts  (Davis,  Torr  &  Degotardi,  2015; Siraj-Blatchford & Manni, 2008). Interestingly, Kidd and Rowland (2021) found that, with two and three year olds, when presented with conversational opportunities, children contributed just about one-third (37%) of the turns. Caregivers can try to increase the number of turn-taking exchanges during interactions by talking about abstract, non-present concepts (Leech & Rowe, 2021). [3]\nHilbrink  et  al.,  (2015).

    "context_enriched_content": "Protoconversations\nInfants  produce  both  speech-like  vocalizations  (i.e.,  protophones)  and  cries  from  birth  (Nathani,  Ertmer  &  Stark,  2006).  Even before  infants  produce  their  first  words,  caregivers  and  infants  show  turn-taking  communication  patterns  referred  to  as 'protoconversation' (Bateson, 1975; Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001). Protoconversations involve communicative turn-taking between caregivers and infants using a variety of communication such as vocalizations, gestures, facial expressions and language. Infants between  3  and  5  months  produce  more  than  40%  of  their  turns  in  overlap  with  caregivers,  while  this  proportion  of  overlap decreases after 5 months and drops to around 20% at 18 months (Hilbrink, Gattis & Levinson, 2015). Caregiver responses (verbal or  non-verbal)  to  infant  protophones  most  often  occur  within  one  second  after  infant  protophones  (Keller  et  al.,  1999;  Yoo, Bowman  &  Oller,  2018).  Caregiver  responses  to  protophones  thus  appear  to  provide  a  rich  learning  opportunity.  Through protoconversation, caregivers play a key role for infants in helping them learn the turn-taking system necessary for communication (Hilbrink,  Gattis  &  Levinson,  2015).  Furthermore,  many  longitudinal  studies  have  shown  that  protophones  are  foundations  for language development (Koopmans-van Beinum & van der Stelt, 1986; Oller, 1980; Roug et al., 1989; Stark, 1980). In summary, early turn-taking and protoconversations support language development by laying the foundation of back-and-forth communication and highlight the role of social interactions for supporting language development (Donnelly & Kidd, 2021). [1]\nFigure : Caregiver and an infant engaged in a protoconversation. ( ) 13.3.3.1 [2]\nCaregivers can use protoconversations to support language development in the following ways:\n- Recognize that protophones offer a special opportunity to bond with an infant and are important for the beginning development of speech.\n- Even before an infant's vocalizations begin to sound like speech, engage with the infant in protoconversations.\n- A protoconversation involves contingent, bidirectional turn taking, so make sure you allow for time devoted to an infant where you can respond to their communication promptly and continue the turn taking conversation.\n- Being an engaging caregiver in the communicative partnership positively affects the quantity and quality of infant vocalizations (Goldstein & Schwade, 2008).\n- There are various ways to respond to infant vocalizations including physical touch, vocalizations, speech and facial expressions. In terms of vocal and speech responses, caregivers have been found to primarily use affirmations and imitations with young infants, and then expand their responses to include expansions, descriptions, and questions as children's abilities increase\n(Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein & Baumwell, 2001). This shows that caregivers are sensitive to infant vocal capacities and respond accordingly, thereby fostering infant vocal development.\nYoo et al., (2018).

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant-Directed Speech\nWhen caregivers interact with infants, their speech often takes on specific, distinguishing features in a speech register known as infant-directed  speech  (Ferjan  Ramírez,  2022;  Fernald  et  al.,  1989).  Infant-directed  speech  is  produced  by  caregivers  of  most (although  not  all)  linguistic  and  cultural  backgrounds  and  is  typically  characterized  by  a  slow,  melodic,  high-pitched,  and exaggerated cadence (Farran, Lee, Yoo &  Oller, 2016; Fernald et al., 1989; Kitamura, Thanavishuth,  Burnham  & Luksaneeyanawin, 2001; Pye, 1986; Shute & Wheldall, 1999). From early in life, infants tune their attention to infant-directed speech, preferring to listen to infant-directed speech over adult-directed speech at birth (Cooper & Aslin, 1990), as well as later in infancy (Cooper & Aslin, 1994; Cooper, Abraham, Berman & Staska, 1997; Fernald, 1985; Hayashi, Tamekawa & Kiritani, 2001; Kitamura & Lam, 2009; ManyBabies Consortium, 2020; Newman & Hussain, 2006; Pegg, Werker & McLeod, 1992; Santesso, Schmidt & Trainor, 2007; Singh, Morgan & Best, 2002). [1]\nInfants' preference for infant-directed speech may play a useful role in early language learning. For example, infants are better able to discriminate speech sounds in infant-directed speech than in adult-directed speech (Karzon, 1985; Trainor & Desjardins, 2002), more efficiently  segment  words  from  continuous  speech  in  an  infant-directed  speech  register  (Thiessen,  Hill  &  Saffran,  2005), demonstrate better long-term memory for words spoken in infant-directed speech (Singh, Nestor, Parikh & Yull, 2009), and learn new words more effectively  from  infant-directed  speech  (Graf  Estes  &  Hurley,  2013;  Ma,  Golinkoff,  Houston  &  Hirsh-Pasek, 2011). Overall amount of infant-directed speech in everyday speech input between 7 to 11 months is positively correlated with language outcomes at five years of age (Weisleder & Fernald, 2013), and amount of infant-directed speech in a one-on-one setting between 11 and 14 months of age is correlated with productive vocabulary at 24 months (Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra & Kuhl, 2014; 2017a) as well as word production at 33 months (Ramírez-Esparza et al., 2017b).

    "context_enriched_content": "Singing\nWhile  infant-directed  speech  has  been  extensively  investigated,  research  on  infant-directed  singing  and  its  relationship  with language development is gaining more attention (Falk & Tsang, 2020; Papadimitriou et al., 2021). Across most cultures, caregivers naturally sing to infants throughout the day (Fernald, 1992; Hilton et al., 2022; Trehub & Trainor, 1998; Yan et al., 2021). In fact, one study captured daylong audio recordings from thirty-five 6 to 12 month old infants and found that 100% of the infants heard both live and recorded music (Mendoza & Fausey 2021). However, not all children are exposed to singing daily. Nationally in the U.S., only 57.4% of infants and toddlers are sung to everyday (Keating, 2021). Comparing the prevalence of daily singing with infants and toddlers across the U.S., Texas had the lowest prevalence (47.6%), Alaska had the highest (72.3%) and California was just under the national average (56.4%) (Keating, 2021). Similar to infant-directed speech, infant-directed singing is characterized by higher pitch and slower tempo than non-infant-directed versions of the same songs by the same singers (Trainor, Clark, Huntley & Adams, 1997; Trehub,   Hill & Kamenetsky, 1997; Trehub et al., 1998). [1] [2] [3]\nTwo common types of songs for infants and toddlers include lullabies and play songs. In line with their soothing function, lullabies feature very slow tempo, low pitch, falling pitch contours, limited amplitude variation, and soothing tone of voice (Trehub, Trainor & Unyk, 1993; Trehub & Trainor, 1998; Unyk, Trehub, Trainor & Schellenberg, 1992), properties that are shared with soothing infant-directed speech. Although play songs are commonly sung to Western infants, unlike lullabies, they are not universal (Trehub & Trainor, 1998). Examples of play songs are 'Old MacDonald had a farm', 'Five little monkeys jumping on the bed' and 'The wheels on the bus'. [4]\nFigure : Caregiver singing with an infant. (Copyright; author via source) 13.3.5.1\nResearch indicates that infants find infant-directed singing more engaging and prefer to listen to it compared to non-infant-directed singing (Masataka, 1999; Nakata & Trehub, 2004; Trainor, 1996; Tsang, Falk & Hessel, 2017). Singing lullabies to infants, even unfamiliar lullabies in an unfamiliar language, helps infants relax and enter a calmer state (Bainbridge et al., 2021). Songs allow infants to capitalize on the acoustic boundary cues within song melodies to organize a continuous song into structurally relevant parts and recognize different phrases while the song unfolds. For example, six month old infants are able to segment children's songs into  phrases  (Hahn,  Benders,  Snijders  &  Fikkert,  2020).  Already  before  their  first  birthday  infants  are  able  to  recognize changes in the syllable order in songs (François et al., 2017; Lebedeva & Kuhl, 2010; Suppanen, Huotilainen, & Ylinen, 2019; Thiessen & Saffran, 2009), differentiate between rhyming and non-rhyming songs (Hahn, Benders, Snijders, & Fikkert, 2018), and learn novel words recurring in the song lyrics (Snijders, Benders, & Fikkert, 2020). Furthermore, infant-directed singing is related to later language development. Specifically, higher levels of infant-directed singing is related to greater language comprehension abilities in infants and later language skills in toddlerhood (Franco et al., 2020; Papadimitriou et al., 2021; Schaal et al., 2020).

    "context_enriched_content": "Joint Attention\nJoint  attention  refers  to  a  shared  focus  between  a  caregiver  and  a  child  (including  gaze,  pointing,  and  visual  attention).  Joint attention is an important feature of language development because once joint attention is shared, the caregiver and child have a communicative context in which information about objects or events in the environment can effectively be communicated. [1]\nFigure : Caregiver and toddler engaged in joint attention ( ) 13.3.6.1 [2]\nDuring the child's first two years of life, joint attention is thought to emerge gradually in interaction with the child's emotional and social development, as well as resulting from cognitive development involving skills like processing, attention and self-regulation (Morales et al., 2000). Already in the first four months of life, infants start to engage with their caregivers in sustained periods of face-to-face or mutual eye gaze (Johnson & de Haan, 2011). Between the ages of 9 to 12 months, children start to explore their environment more. At this point, dyadic attention shifts to triadic attention in which caregiver and child start to coordinate and systematically  divide  their  attention  between  objects  or  events  in  the  environment  and  with  each  other  (Carpenter  et  al.,  1998; Wille, Van Lierde & Van Herreweghe, 2019). It should be noted, however, that these episodes of triadic joint attention do not occur frequently until children are about 15 to 18 months old (Carpenter et al., 1998). [1]\nJoint attention is related to language development. Children's ability to respond to bids of joint attention by their caregiver at 6, 8, 10, and 18 months of age has been reported to predict vocabulary size at 30 months of age (Morales et al., 2000). Interestingly, there is also some evidence suggesting that responding to joint attention may be predictive of receptive vocabulary size and that initiating joint attention may be predictive of expressive vocabulary size (Markus et al., 2001; Mundy, Fox & Card, 2003; Mundy & Gomes, 1998). Gaze-following behavior at 10 to 11 months predicted receptive vocabulary at both 14 and 18 months (Brooks & Meltzoff,  2005).  Further,  full-term  infants'  responsiveness  to  gaze  alternations  in  triadic  interactions  at  9  months  and  initiating triadic interactions at 14 months were positively correlated with later language, such that infants with more responsivity to gaze shifts  had  better  receptive  and  expressive  language  scores  at  30  months  (De  Schuymer  et  al.,  2011).  Individual  differences  in responding  to  joint  attention  at  9  and  12  months  and  initiating  joint  attention  at  18  months  predicted  24-months  expressive language (Mundy et al., 2007). [4] [3]\nFigure : Caregiver and toddler engaged in joint attention. ( ) 13.3.6.1 [4]\nOne reason joint attention is related to language development is because shared attention toward an object allows for language to be more easily mapped to objects. For example if a caregiver and an infant are jointly attending to the same object, such as a dinosaur, when the caregiver uses the word 'dinosaur' it creates a clear link between the object (dinosaur) and its linguistic label."

    "context_enriched_content": "Joint Attention\nAlthough engaging in joint attention is a natural activity for caregivers, it does require an investment of uninterrupted time to truly engage with infants and toddlers. So much of a caregivers' time can be devoted to care routines, preparation and cleaning, it can be a challenge to set aside time for joint attention to take place. For joint attention to occur, caregivers must be fully present in their interactions with children as they share joint attention through eye gaze, visual attention and pointing, oftentimes accompanied with physical touch and language. One study found that across 200 toddlers recorded for twenty minutes while attending group care programs, one third of the children did not engage in any joint attention with caregivers (Smith, 1999). When caregivers practice reading the communicative cues and practice engaging in joint attention with infants and toddlers, they improve in their ability to share in joint attention with children (Cain, Rudd & Saxon, 2007; Gouri-Guberman, 2015; Rudd, Cain & Saxon, 2008). One reason joint attention may be beneficial is that it increases the amount of time infants pay attention to something, such as an object. During moments of joint attention, caregivers can increase an infant's attention by talking about and manually manipulating the object an infant is interested in (Suarez-Rivera, Smith & Yu, 2019).\nLammertink et al., (2022).

    "context_enriched_content": "Baby Signs and Sign Language\nBaby signs are gestures created to provide an early way for caregivers to communicate with infants and toddlers and acquire insight and respect for underestimated communicative abilities of children before they can talk (Vallotton, 2008; 2011). The baby signs system is not a full system and is not the same as sign language. Baby signs were created as a means to ease communication as manual communication often precedes spoken language production (Goldin-Meadow, Goodrich, Sauer & Iverson, 2007). Baby signs  are  usually  used  while  simultaneously  using  a  spoken  language  and  do  not  mark  each  word  spoken  in  a  sentence.  For example, if a caregiver asks an infant, 'Do you want more?', the baby sign for 'more' will be used when the spoken word 'more' is pronounced.\nFigure :  Signs for 'more' and 'drink'. Signs for more: fingers of both hands together and bring them together and apart repeatedly. Sign for drink, hold hand as if holding a cup and bring to mouth to mimic drinking. ( ) 13.3.7.1 [1]\nIn  comparison  to  baby  signs,  sign  languages  are  fully-fledged  language  systems  naturally  created  by  Deaf  individuals.  As misconceptions about sign languages continue to persist, there are a few facts to know: [2]\n- Sign languages are complex language systems with similar linguistic properties as spoken languages (Sandler, 2017; Woll, 2013).\n- Most countries have their own sign language (Jepsen, De Clerck, Lutalo-Kiingi & McGregor, 2015), such American Sign Language in the U.S., Lengua de Señas Mexicana in Mexico and Nederlandse Gebarentaal, the primary sign language used in the Netherlands.\n- Infants and toddlers learning a signed language as a native language show acquisition patterns and reach milestones similar to children learning a spoken language (Caselli, Lieberman & Pyers, 2020; Lillo-Martin & Henner, 2021; MacDonald et al., 2018).\n- Similar neural systems support the processing of both signed and spoken languages (Corina & McBurney, 2001; MacSweeney, Capek, Campbell & Woll, 2008).\nAfter  early  investigations  reported  that  very  young  children  of  Deaf  parents  often  attained  early  language  milestones  in  sign language at  younger  ages  than  children  learning  a  spoken  language  (Bellugi,  &  Klima,  1982;  Bonvillian,  Orlansky  &  Novack, 1983; McIntire, 1977), other investigators began to study the learning of signs or symbolic gestures by the young hearing children of  hearing  parents  (Acredolo  &  Goodwyn, 1996; Goodwyn & Acredolo, 1993, 1998). In this research, those infants who were taught a collection of 'baby signs' typically acquired the signs faster than speech-trained infants acquired a collection of spoken target  words.  The  investigators  attributed  the  children's  slower  acquisition  of  spoken  words  to  the  difficulties  and  complexities involved in spoken language production early in a child's development. In other words, a child's physical ability to produce speech or control the muscles needed for recognizable speech seems to lag behind the child's physical ability to control the arm and hand movements  needed  to  produce  recognizable  signs.  The  children  in  the  sign-trained  group  showed  a  long-term  advantage  on  a number  of  language  development  measures  throughout  early  childhood,  as  well  as  higher  school-age  IQ  scores  (Acredolo, Goodwyn,  &  Abrams,  2002;  Goodwyn,  Acredolo,  &  Brown,  2000).  These  findings  indicate  that  early  signing  or  symbolic gesturing does not hamper verbal development and may, in fact, enhance it. [3]\nFigure :  Signs  for  'eat'  and  'finish'.

    "context_enriched_content": "Baby Signs and Sign Language\nIn another investigation, forty infants were followed from the age of eight months to twenty months where half of the mothers modeled signs or gestures for a limited number of target set signs, whereas the remaining half of the mothers focused on spoken language input (Kirk, Howlett, Pine & Fletcher, 2013). The mothers in the sign/gesture-input conditions became more sensitive to their infants' nonverbal cues than the mothers in the speech-only condition. Numerous studies have shown that use of baby signs is related to more responsiveness from caregivers and helps infants and caregivers to be more insync with each other when interacting (Góngora & Farkas, 2009; Norman & Byrne, 2021; Olson & Masur, 2013; Paul et al., 2019; Vallotton, 2009; 2012; Zammit & Atkinson, 2017). This increased sensitivity to infants' nonverbal cues may be an important benefit of sign input as such sensitivity may contribute to closer caregiver-infant bonding. [3]\nIn an attempt to explain the positive outcomes associated with baby-signing in their research, Goodwyn and Acredolo suggested that the children's symbolic gestures or signs may have elicited more spoken language input from the children's parents as well as indicated  to  the  parents  the  specific  topics  in  which  the  children  were  interested  in.  There  are,  however,  other  possible interpretations. One is that combining sign and spoken language input may facilitate the vocal production of typically developing babies as it does for many children with Down syndrome (Özçalişkan et al., 2016) or autism (Özçalişkan et al., 2017). A second possibility is that because 'baby-signing' typically involves caregivers producing signs for only the key words in their utterances, this  combining  of  signs  and  spoken  language  may  help  infants  segment  the  speech  stream  by  making  the  signed  words  more prominent, thus facilitating their acquisition (Mueller & Acosta, 2015).

Sign for hurt, extend pointer finger, curl other fingers in and move hands together and apart. ( ) 13.3.7.3 [5]\nAlong  with  the  claim  of  potentially  fostering  more  rapid  spoken  language  development,  the  early  use  of  signs  also  has  been associated with fewer and less severe temper tantrums in infancy and early childhood (Acredolo et al., 2002). Additional support for this claim of improved social behavior is seen in a study of hearing infants who were taught manual signs early in their lives. Once  these  infants  acquired  minimal  functional  sign  skills,  their  incidence  of  crying  and  whining  decreased  substantially (Thompson et al., 2007). [3]\nCaregivers can easily learn basic signs and use them with infants and toddlers. Using baby signs per se is not necessary. Baby signs are based on signed languages and often require unnecessary financial purchases. Baby signs are sometimes modified to be easier to  manually  produce  for  young  children,  but  young  children  natively  acquire  sign  languages  and  naturally  produce  signs  that caregivers can understand even if they are not exact replicates of the adults'.

    "context_enriched_content": "Shared Reading\nIs reading books with infants and toddlers important? Most likely, you quickly answered this question with a resounding 'yes!'. While  most  people  might  strongly  agree  that  reading  with  young  children  is  an  important  activity,  only  37.2%  of  infants  and toddlers  nationally  are  read  to  everyday  (Keating  et  al.,  2021).  Reading  is  so  important  because  it  maximizes  the  kinds  of experiences that optimally predict language learning. A study of 3,547 children between 1 to 2 years of age, found that children who were read to for at least eleven minutes everyday had stronger reading, spelling, and grammatical skills in both third grade and fifth grade (Brown, Wang & McLeod, 2022). There are at least three ways in which book reading influences language learning: [1]\n- First, it offers children the opportunity to hear new vocabulary items embedded in varied grammatical sentences. Books written for children use well-formed, relatively short sentences that are rich in varied vocabulary. Furthermore, books often use the same words in diverse grammatical constructions, offering implicit lessons in how words are used. The texts of books tend to have more words that are less commonly used than does spoken language (Dickinson & Tabors, 2001) and books encourage use of a wider range of words than would occur in everyday conversations. Indeed, shared reading is a robust predictor of children's vocabulary and reading comprehension abilities (Demir-Lira, Applebaum, Goldin-Meadow & Levine, 2019; Sénéchal, 2011). [1]\n- The second way in which book reading enriches children's language development is that it promotes joint attention and interest. Consider all the ways in which books help children maintain their attention. Children's books often use bold colors and strong contrasts and typically depict illustrated objects and animals that appeal to young children. The page of the book provides a clear focus for attention, and, unlike movable toys such as balls and trucks, books are held and remain relatively stationary. An attentive adult can easily notice what a child is attending to and build on it with commentary. In turn, children are able to draw an adult's attention to interesting areas of the pictures using a broad range of cues including gestures, sounds, and words. Thus, attention can be managed by the child as well as the adult. [1]\n- Finally, book reading helps children learn language because it requires the participants, both caregiver and child, to be active and engage in responsive interactions about word meanings. It is an opportunity for a caregiver to focus on the child and make efforts to be responsive to their interests. When caregivers and young children communicate during book reading and move away from the text, they are engaging in a language-rich activity that yields even more varied vocabulary and diverse sentence structures (Arnold, D. H., Lonigan, Whitehurst & Epstein, 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988). Dialogic reading occurs when adults follow the child's interest and engage in conversation about material on the printed page or about experiences the child has had that relate to the story. Book reading becomes an 'up close and personal' experience when done in this way and yields the most in the way of language learning (Valdez-Menchaca & Whitehurst, 1992). [1]\nAdditionally, the frequency of shared reading, the age at which caregivers begin to read to children and repeated reading of books are important factors that further the benefits of shared reading for language development.\nThe importance of reading frequency for children from birth to age three is clearly revealed by numerous studies (Rodriguez & Tamis-LeMonda, 2011). Just reading one picture book every day can lead to an increase of approximately 78,000 words each year (Logan, Justice, Yumus & Chaparro-Moreno, 2019). Findings of a large study finding caregivers' reports of daily book reading at age 14 months related to vocabulary and language comprehension at 14 and 24 months (Raikes et al., 2006). A longitudinal study focused on 1,046 children examined language and cognitive abilities at 14, 24, and 36 months of age (Rodriguez et al., 2009). Literacy experiences at each of the three ages was related to language and cognitive skills at three years of age. [1]\nFigure : Infant looking through a collection of books. ( ) 13.3.8.1 [2]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Shared Reading\nThere is also evidence that the age at which parents begin to read to children is important. One observational study found that children in households where reading was reported with children as young as eight months had stronger early language growth (Debaryshe, 1993). An intervention study compared the effects of interactive reading when their babies were 4 months old and when babies were 8 months old. Only the condition with older babies was effective, with improved language abilities being found when the babies were 12 and 16 months old (Karrass & Braungart-Rieker, 2005). [1]\nRepeated readings of the same books can also increase children's engagement (Fletcher & Jean-Francois, 1998; Morrow, 1988) and enhance their language learning through shared reading (Snow & Goldfield, 1983). Children who read a familiar book talk more than when reading a novel book (Fletcher & Reese, 2005). Moreover, parents and children talk more about related content or their own experiences when re-reading the same book, which also increases children's world knowledge (Haden et al., 1996; Hayden & Fagan, 1987). For children with lower language abilities, repeated readings of the same book increase engagement in comparison to readings of different books (Morrow, 1988). Repeated readings provide multiple opportunities for repeated imitation (Ninio, 1983) and processing of novel words in a meaningful context (Sénéchal, 1997) as books contain more unique words compared to childdirected  speech  (Montag,  Jones  &  Smith,  2015).  Experimental  studies  have  found  that  children's  expressive  vocabulary  is enhanced after two or more readings of the same book, whereas one reading often does not result in significant vocabulary gains (Horst, Parsons & Bryan, 2011; McLeod & McDade, 2011; Sénéchal & Cornell, 1993; Sénéchal, 1997;).

Reading the words on the pages is a great start, but there can be so much more to discuss! Variation in how books are read and discussed has been found to be important. Ninio (1980) examined interactions  between  Israeli  caregivers  and  infants  between  17  and  22  months  of  age.  Caregivers  tended  to  use  one  of  three interactional routines, asking one of two types of questions 'What's that?,' 'Where's that?,' or simply naming objects. A large study of the reading approaches of 126 caregivers found variability in how they read to children at age 7 and 24 months (Britto, Brooks-Gunn & Griffin, 2006). Caregiver reading style was related to language growth, with children showing greater language growth when they were encouraged to participate in the reading and supported in their understanding; however, this reading style was found in only 30 of the 126 caregivers. [2]\nOne of the most common methods to improve caregivers' reading with young children is dialogic reading as it is not commonly implemented when caregivers read with infants and toddlers  (Huebner  &  Meltzoff,  2005).  To  encourage  caregivers  to  see  that reading should be about more than just the words on pages, reading with infants and toddlers is best perceived as an interaction between  the  caregiver,  the  child  and  the  book.  Perceiving  book  reading  as  more  of  an  interaction  is  oftentimes  referred  to  as dialogic reading. Dialogic reading uses techniques that encourage the caregiver to be responsive to the child with conversations that follow the child's interest and lead. Dialogic reading typically involves recasts, expansions, and open-ended questions, all of which have been shown to have a positive impact on a child's language development (Baker & Nelson, 1984; Cleave et al., 2015; Farrar, 1990; Girolametto & Weitzman, 2002; Huttenlocher et al., 2010; Nelson, 1977). A meta-analysis of dialogic reading found that it loses its value with the older children (Mol, Bus, De Jong & Smeets, 2008). It may be that the method is best suited to book reading with infants, toddlers, and younger preschool children. [2] [3]\nFigure : Caregiver reading with two toddlers. ( ) 13.3.9.2 [1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Dialogic Reading\nOne reason dialogic reading is so beneficial for children's language development is because it involves quality language-boosting practices.  For  example,  the  child-directed  speech  delivered  during  interactive  shared  book  reading  contains  higher  levels  of syntactic and lexical diversity than the speech children are exposed to during play-based activities (Cameron-Faulkner & Noble, 2013; Demir-Lira, Applebaum, Goldin-Meadow & Levine, 2019; Noble et al., 2018; Salo, Rowe, Leech & Cabrera, 2016), and high  levels  of  syntactic  and  lexical  diversity  in  speech  directed  to  children  are  linked  to  higher  levels  of  syntactic  and  lexical diversity  in  children's  speech  (Huttenlocher  et  al.,  2002).  Interactive  shared  book  reading  has  also  been  shown  to  foster  higher levels  of  joint  attention,  responsiveness,  and  contingent  talk,  all  of  which  have  been  shown  to  support  language  development (Carpenter et al., 1998; Farrant & Zubrick, 2013; McGillion, Pine, Herbert & Matthews, 2017; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986). It also encourages the caregiver to use additional language-boosting practices, which have all been shown to support children's language development,  including  expanding,  recasting,  and  asking  open-ended  questions  (Baker  &  Nelson,  1984;  Cleave  et  al.,  2015; Girolametto & Weitzman, 2002; Huttenlocher et al., 2010). []\nFigure :Caregiver reading with an infant. ( ) 13.3.9.3 [4]\nMany studies that have trained caregivers in dialogic reading strategies report positive gains in young children's language outcomes (Chacko, Fabiano, Doctoroff & Fortson, 2018; Grolig, Cohrdes, Tiffin-Richards & Schroeder, 2020; Kim & Riley, 2021; Lonigan et  al.,  1999;  Opel,  Ameer  &  Aboud,  2009;  Purpura,  Napoli,  Wehrspann  &  Gold,  2017;  Simsek  &  Erdogan,  2015;  Towson, Gallagher,  &  Bingham,  2016;  Valdez-Menchaca  &  Whitehurst,  1992).  For  example,  Valdez-Menchaca  and  Whitehurst  (1992) trained teachers to read using a dialogic reading style that involved asking more open-ended questions and responding to children's attempts to answer these questions with low-income Mexican toddlers. Children who received the dialogic reading intervention scored significantly higher on measures of both expressive and receptive language than children in the control group. [3]\nMany studies have found that asking basic comprehension questions during shared reading increases the effects on oral language skills in comparison to reading story books aloud without asking questions (Flack, Field & Horst, 2018; Wasik, Hindman & Snell, 2016).  Asking  such  literal  comprehension  questions  both  serves  to  attain  joint  attention  and  to  establish  a  fundamental\nunderstanding of concepts and events. Discussing the meanings of new words in the context of the story and in other contexts facilitates a deeper word understanding (Coyne et al., 2009). [5]\n[3]\nBy implementing the PEER sequence, the caregiver:\n- prompts the child to say something about the book,\n- evaluates the child's response,\n- expands the child's response, and\n- repeats the prompt to help the child learn from the expansion.\nA fundamental element of dialogic reading is the use of prompts to begin the PEER sequence while reading with a child.

In order to design the most responsive and linguistically enriching care and educational experiences for multilingual infants and toddlers, it is important  for  caregivers  to  have  a  good  understanding  of  the  unique  contexts  that  shape  the  development  of  children  learning multiple languages, in which ways they differ from those of monolingual children and practices to best support their multilingual development. This section will explain what multilingualism means, address common misconceptions, describe how infants and toddlers develop multiple languages and provide strategies for caregivers to best support multilingual children.\nThis page titled 14.1: Introduction is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "What is Multilingualism?\nWhat does it mean to be multilingual? Across educational and research fields, a number of different terms and definitions have been used to describe children who are multilingual. The term multilingual may encompass or overlap substantially with other terms frequently used, such as 'bilingual', 'dual language learner', 'English language learner' and 'children who speak a language other  than  English'.  For  the  purpose  of  this  section,  the  term  multilingual  refers  to  children  who  are  learning  two  (or  more) languages at the same time, or learning an additional language while continuing to develop their native language(s). [1]\nFigure : Toddler and caregiver from India. ( ) 14.2.1 [2]\nMultilingualism is a complex construct that has been redefined over the past several decades. Scholars once defined multilinguals exclusively as a small group of speakers who were perfectly 'balanced' in their languages (Lambert, Havelka, Gardner, 1959). The definition of multilingualism has since expanded to include individuals with varying degrees of proficiency and different language experiences. An individual's multilingual status is not a trait that can be directly measuredGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>multilingualism cannot be determined in the  same  way  as  someone's  height,  for  example.  When  measuring  multilingualism,  researchers  often  rely  on  a  combination  of factors, such as language proficiency and amount of exposure, to determine an individual's multilingual status (Anderson, Mak, Keyvani  Chahi  &  Bialystok,  2018;  Li,  Sepanski  &  Zhao,  2006,  2014;  Marian,  Blumenfeld  &  Kaushanskaya,  2007;  Marian  & Hayakawa, 2020). [1]\nLow-proficiency multilinguals\nMonolinguals\nHigh-proficiency multilinguals\nL2 learners\nFigure : Representation of a categorical model of multilingualism with different possible groups of multilinguals. ( ) 14.2.2 [4]\nIn order to account for the full spectrum of multilinguals' experiences and language abilities, some scholars have proposed that multilingualism should be viewed as a continuous variable (Baum & Titone, 2014; de Bruin, 2019; Kaushanskaya & Prior, 2015;\nMarian & Hayakawa, 2020; Takahesu Tabori, Mech & Atagi, 2018). Under such an approach, the continuum of being multilingual would  span  the  range  from  completely  monolingual  (i.e.,  never  having  any  exposure  to  a  second  language)  to  fully  proficient multilingual (i.e.,  'balanced'  across  languages).Figure shows  a  visual representation of  a  continuous  model  of multilingualism. Other models of multilingualism may even combine both categorical and continuous models (Kremin & ByersHeinlein, 2021). Clearly, being multilingual is much more complex than simply learning or knowing two or more languages. 14.2.3 [3]\nFigure : Representation of a continuous model of multilingualism. ( ) 14.2.3 [5]\nEach  multilingual  child's  language  learning  experience  is  unique:  children  differ  in  terms  of  the  specific  languages  they  are learning, when they start learning each, and how they experience them. Contexts for multilingualism may be very different across families, child care programs, communities, and cultures (Rowe & Weisleder, 2020). Taking this diversity into account is key to understanding early multilingual development. As a result, each multilingual child will have their own developmental path (de Bruin, 2019)GLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>there are nearly as many ways to grow up multilingual as there are multilingual children!

    "context_enriched_content": "What is Multilingualism?\nDespite the diversity, a common factor across multilingual development is the crucial role of the quantity and quality of exposure infants and toddlers receive in their different languages (Marchman, Fernald & Hurtado, 2010; Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra & Kuhl, 2017). For example, we would not expect a child to learn a language they only hear for 5 minutes per day (low quantity) or to learn a language from 5 hours a day of isolated vocabulary words recited from an audiotape (low quality). It is difficult to know exactly what combination of quantity and quality is required, but some studies estimate that children need a minimum of 10% to 25% of overall exposure in a language to achieve fluency in it, which will only occur if their language experience is rich and varied (Place  &  Hoff,  2011).  If  children  do  not  receive  sufficient  high-quality  multilingual  exposure,  they  are  unlikely  to  become proficient in all of their languages.

    "context_enriched_content": "Multilingual Children\nMany  children  around  the  world  are  multilingual.  Recent  estimates  suggest  that  approximately  7,000  languages  are  currently spoken worldwide in only 196 Countries (Simons & Fennig, 2018). This suggests that the vast majority of the world's population is consistently exposed to two or more languages and can be considered multilingual (Baker, 2006; Jonak, 2015; Marian & Shook, 2012). Reported rates of multilingualism in places such as Europe (67%), Canada (55%), India (25%), and the United States (20%) indicate that multilingualism is both common and increasing (Luk, 2017; Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India, 2001). The current rates for the number of multilingual children are often even higher than that for adults. For example, in the U.S. 26% of 5 to 17 year children nationwide are multilingual, although rates differ by state. In the U.S. the state of California has  the  highest  percentage  of  multilingual  children  at  43%,  while  only  2%  of  children  in  West  Virginia  are  multilingual  (Kids Count Data Center,  2019).  An  estimated  15%  of  children  in  Australia  (Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics,  2006),  18%  to  25%  of children in Canada (Schott et al., 2021), 29% of children in parts of Spain (Statistical Institute of Catalonia, 2007) and 90% of children in Singapore (Wu et al., 2020) grow up multilingual. [1] [2] [3]\nIt is much more challenging to find estimates of the number of children under age three that are multilingual. Data from Canada provides unique insight into estimates of infant and toddler multilingualism and how rates differ geographically even within the same country. Across Canada, 15.6% of children aged 0 to 4 and 20.4% of children aged 5 to 9 years of age are multilingual. Broken down by province/region, the rate of child multilingualism was highest in Northern Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and  Nunavut),  with  nearly  one  in  three  children  speaking  two  languages  at  home,  in  most  cases  an  Indigenous  language  and English. Nearly one in four children aged 0 to 4 in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montréal, spoke at least two languages at home. In Calgary and Edmonton, rates were one in six for children aged 0 to 4. Provinces with larger cities had higher overall rates of multilingualism (i.e., British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec). Across all provinces, the rate of multilingualism among 5 to 9 year olds was higher than 0 to 4 year olds, which could be due to some children acquiring a community language at school and then starting to use that language at home. This pattern has been documented in the United States for native Spanish-speaking children learning English (Hammer, Lawrence & Miccio 2008). [4]\nFigure : Map of Canada.

In the U.S., children in a multilingual home, are likely to have parents without a high school education, are likely to be growing up under economic challenges, and are likely to be raised in specific cultural contexts that may differ from mainstream U.S.  norms.  (Winsler  et  al.,  2014).  In  addition,  it  has  been  found  that  children  with  immigrant  parents  (who  are  likely  to  be multilingual) are more likely than those with parents born in the U.S. to live in two-parent families (Hernandez & Napierala, 2012); immigrant  mothers  are  more  likely  to  be  married,  less  likely  to  be  depressed,  and  more  likely  to  have  larger  families  than nonimmigrant mothers (Mistry, Biesanz, Chien, Howes, & Benner, 2008). These sociocultural factors represent a constellation of strengths and potential challenges for multilingual children growing up in the U.S. [7]\nFigure : Infant with his Indonesian grandmother ( ) 14.3.3 [1]\nThis page titled 14.3: Demographics of Multilingual Children is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

As infant and toddler multilingualism becomes a prominent phenomenon across the U.S. it is critical to examine how caregivers' beliefs and knowledge regarding multilingualism relates to childrens' language experiences in group care and childrens' developmental outcomes over time. [7]\nOne common concern about multilingualism is that early exposure to multiple languages is confusing for children. Research does not support this concern. Young infants can perceive the difference between different languages within the first few days or months of life (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 2001; Byers-Heinlein, Burns & Werker, 2010). Infancy and toddlerhood represent a sensitive period for language acquisition, when the brain is particularly receptive to the properties of language (Kuhl et al., 2005; Werker & Tees, 2005). For this reason, multilingual children exposed to their languages earlier in development become better at them, and will speak and process them in a more native-like manner (Bialystok, 2001; Zhao, Boorom, Kuhl & Gordon, 2021). [3]\nAnother common concern is that childhood multilingualism can cause language disorders and delays. Research does not support this concern. Language disorders and delays occur in multilingual children at the same rates as in monolingual children (Kohnert, Ebert & Pham, 2020; Peña et al., 2011). In fact, many children with various developmental disabilities also grow up multilingual, including children with specific language impairments (Paradis et al., 2011), children with Down Syndrome (Kay-Raining Bird et al., 2005), and children with autism spectrum disorder (Gonzalez-Barrero & Nadig, 2019). Importantly multilingual children with developmental disabilities should have difficulties across their languages, not just with one language (Kohnert, 2010; Peña, Iglesias & Lidz, 2001; Restrepo & Kruth, 2000). Multilingualism neither causes nor facilitates/aggravates a possible condition of dyslexia or any specific language disorders in general (Crescentini, Marini & Fabbro, 2012). To ensure accurate assessment of the language development of multilingual infants and toddlers, caregivers must assess all of the child's languages (Nayeb et al., 2021) [1] [3] [8]\nThis page titled 14.4: Multilingualism- Beliefs and Misconceptions is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Todd LaMarr."

    "context_enriched_content": "Uniqueness of Multilingualism\nAs the population of young multilingual children continues to increase across the U.S., there has been a corresponding explosion of research about their development. These research findings provide a scientific basis for designing child care program approaches, and assessment procedures. [7]\nSome features of multilinguals' language development may look like speech or language delays (Sandhofer & Uchikoshi, 2013). The ongoing challenges of processing more than one language and frequently switching between languages results in a different set of language and cognitive strengths and needs for multilingual children than those of monolingual children (Francis, 2021). Young children  who  are  learning  through  two  languages  initially  make  slower  progress  in  each  of  their  languages  than  monolingual children  (Sandhofer  &  Uchikoshi,  2013).  In  addition,  they  typically  have  smaller  vocabularies  in  each  of  their  languages  than monolingual  children,  but  their  total  vocabulary  size  (the  sum  of  what  children  know  in  all  of  their  languages)  is  similar  to monolingual children (Core, Hoff, Rumiche & Señor, 2013). Young multilinguals also take longer to recall words from memory and have lower scores on verbal fluency tasks, as their language processing is more complex than that of monolingual children (Petitto et al., 2011). Most often these differences are temporary and disappear as young multilinguals become more proficient in both of their languages (Conboy, 2013). It is important to remember that these early differences in the language development of young multilinguals are just that-differences and not delays! They are a byproduct of the challenges of hearing, processing, and making meaning from multiple language systems during the early childhood years. [1]\nLuo  et  al.,  (2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Language Discrimination\nOne potential challenge for infants growing up with regular exposure to multiple languages is in discriminating between languages. Being able to  separate  the  languages  from  very  early  on  seems  crucial  given  that  the  child  has  to  establish  different  linguistic systems for the languages. [1]\nEarly research on monolingual infants has demonstrated that newborns are able to discriminate between different languages but only  if  the  languages  belong  to  different  rhythmic  classes.  For  example,  French  newborns  could  discriminate  English  from Japanese,  Spanish  and  Italian  but  not  from  Dutch  (Nazzi,  Bertoncini  &  Mehler,  1998;  Ramus  et  al.,  2000).  The  only  study  on multilingual exposure effects with newborns tested infants from multilingual English-Tagalog mothers who regularly used both languages during pregnancy (Byers-Heinlein, Burns & Werker, 2010). The experiment tested discrimination using a habituation paradigm in which infants were first exposed to either English or Tagalog sentences until their sucking rates to a special pacifier decreased below a predefined criterion (habitituation) and then were presented with sentences from the other language. Results revealed  that  both  monolingual  and  multilingual  infants  showed  an  increase  in  their  sucking  after  the  language  change, demonstrating that multilingual newborns were able to discriminate between both languages, just like monolinguals. [1]\nAt  the  age  of  4  months,  monolingual  infants  begin  to  discriminate  languages  of  the  same  rhythmical  class  from  their  native language (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 2001; Chong, Vicenik & Sundara, 2018; Molnar, Gervain & Carreiras, 2014; Nazzi, Jusczyk & Johnson, 2000) suggesting that they have acquired some inventory of cues that help them separate their native language from other  languages.  Similar  to  monolinguals,  multilinguals  are  able  to  discriminate  between  languages  at  the  same  age  as monolinguals (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 2001; Garcia, Guerrero-Mosquera, Colomer & Sebastian-Galles, 2018). For example, monolingual Basque and multilingual Spanish/Basque infants were first habituated with stimuli from one language, and then tested with stimuli from both languages. Results showed that both groups were able to discriminate between the two languages (Molnar, Gervain & Carreiras, 2014). This suggests that by the age of 4 months multilingual infants have detected some properties that separate their two languages and that they can assign these properties specifically to one of their languages.

    "context_enriched_content": "Growth of Word Learning\nWord learning starts in the second half of the first year of life, with some evidence for knowledge of a limited number of words as early as 6 months (Bergelson & Swingley, 2012; Tincoff & Jusczyk, 1999, 2012). Word learning then increases, often with a sharp acceleration,  in  the  second  year  of  life  (Fenson,  Dale,  Reznick,  Bates,  Thal  &  Pethick,  1994).  This  early  development  is characterized by extensive individual variability in the sizes of both receptive and productive vocabularies. [1]\nSince multilingual infants' input is distributed over more than one language, they are likely to receive less input in each of their languages than monolinguals, which can have an impact on early lexical development. Moreover, since multilingual infants will vary in terms of the relative amount of input they receive in their languages, the languages might not develop at the same speed. Recent studies support these points. When multilinguals are evaluated on each of their languages separately, studies report that they lag  behind  monolinguals  starting  in  the  second  year  of  life  (Core,  Hoff,  Rumiche  &  Señor,  2013)  and  the  relative  amount  of exposure for each language is related to the growth of that specific language (Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2014). [1]\nOne crucial aspect when comparing monolingual and multilingual infants' trajectories of word learning is in how vocabulary is counted. One is conceptual vocabulary: counting every referent for which a child has a word for in either language (a FrenchGerman child would get a 1 for knowing either chien, hund, or both); another approach is total vocabulary, counting every word known across  both  languages  (the  same  child  would  get  a  2  for  knowing  both  chien  and  hund).  Considering  how  to  measure multilingual vocabulary growth, especially when comparing to monolinguals, is critical as the results can vary greatly (Hoff et al., 2012).  For  example,  a  study  comparing  English-German  and  English  monolingual  24  to  27  month  old  toddlers  found  that  the multilinguals' total vocabularies were significantly larger than both their conceptual vocabularies and the English vocabularies of English-learning children (Junker & Stockman, 2002). Evidence also suggests that vocabulary growth is influenced by language dominance, with higher vocabulary scores in the dominant as compared to the non-dominant language (Hoff et al., 2012). What is clear is that when multilinguals' vocabulary levels are evaluated using measures that take into account both of their languages, they fall within a similar range as monolingual infants. When assessing the language development of multilinguals, the development of all of their languages should always be considered (Nayeb et al., 2021). [1]\nFigure : Toddler (1.5 years old) growing up in China. ( ) 14.6.2 [3]\nBesides charting the growth trajectory of word learning through vocabulary knowledge, some studies have explored word learning by  investigating  the  speed  at  which  multilingual  infants  recognize  words  in  each  of  their  languages.  Previous  research  with monolinguals has revealed that speed of language processing is related to later cognitive and language outcomes (Fernald, Perfors & Marchman, 2006; Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2007; Marchman & Fernald, 2008). In a study with Spanish/English 30 month old multilinguals, results revealed that processing speed in each of the children's languages was related to their vocabulary in that specific language (Marchman, Fernald & Hurtado, 2010). Similar findings were also shown in another study with 16 to 22 month old  Spanish/English  multilinguals  (DeAnda,  Hendrickson,  Zesiger,  Poulin-Dubois  &  Friend,  2018).  This  research  suggests  that language processing speed and vocabulary acquisition are linked in multilinguals, as had been found in monolinguals, but that this link is language specific. [1]"

One  reason  is  that  children's  experience  is  divided  between  their  different  languages.  Moreover, multilingual children must engage in a constant 'mental juggling' of their two languages (Kroll et al., 2011; Kroll & Bialystok, 2013;  Bosworth,  Binder,  Tyler  &  Morford,  2021),  which  can  present  challenges  and  opportunities  for  cognition,  language representation, and processing (Marian & Shook, 2012).

Studies also show that acquiring multiple languages in infancy, compared to acquiring an additional language in later childhood or adolescence, results in more efficient neural language processing (Berken, Gracco & Klein, 2017; Klein, Mok, Chen & Watkins, 2014) and higher brain tissue density in regions supporting language, memory, and attention (Mechelli et al., 2004). [2]\nMultilingualism sculpts the brain's functional and structural organization (Arredondo, Aslin & Werker, 2021; Hayakawa & Marian, 2019; Pliatsikas, 2020). For example, multilingual infants show different brain responses to native and non-native speech sounds compared to monolingual infants (Conboy & Kuhl, 2011; Garcia-Sierra et al., 2011), and multilingual children recruit different brain areas during sentence processing (Jasinska & Petitto, 2013). Adult research shows that the age of acquisition of a second language  affects  the  brain's  language  networks  (Berken,  Gracco,  &  Klein,  2017),  and  functional  connectivity  (Kousaie,  Chai, Sander, & Klein, 2017). Moreover, multilingualism also affects the structure of both gray (Andrea et al., 2004; Ressel et al., 2012) and white matter (Kuhl et al.,  2016)  in  adults.  Looking  at  the  tissue  in  the  brain,  there  are  regions  that  predominantly  contain neuron cell bodies and dendrites and regions that are largely composed of just axons. These two regions are often referred to as gray matter (the regions with many cell bodies and dendrites) or white matter (the regions with many myelinated axons). Patterns of  structural  differences  appear  to  depend  on  whether  the  languages  were  acquired  simultaneously  from  birth,  or  sequentially before age five (Berken, Gracco, Chen & Klein, 2015), suggesting that timing of multilingualism interacts with brain development. [1] [3]\nGarcia et al., (2018) analyzed the brain activity of 4.5 month old monolingual and multilingual infants in their native language and two  foreign  languages.  Figure shows  the  event  related  potential  (ERP)  waveforms  of  monolingual  (left  side)  and multilingual (right side) infants to native (blue), Italian (green) and German (red) languages. The ERP component they looked at was the P200. Most ERP components are referred to by a letter (usually N or P) indicating polarity (negative/positive), followed by a  number  indicating  the  latency  or  timing  delay  between  the  presentation  of  a  stimulus  and  the  specific  brain  response  in milliseconds. So the P200 component refers to a positive spike around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus. 14.7.1 [4]\nFigure : ERP waveforms to native and non-native languages in monolingual (a) and multilingual (b) four-month-old infants.

    "context_enriched_content": "Brain Development\nAlthough both groups of infants showed a P200 response to all languages, monolinguals showed shorter latencies (less processing time) of the P200 component for their native language compared to the language of the different rhythmic class (German). In other words, the P200 waveform for monolinguals listening to their native language occurred earlier than their responses for the nonnative  languages,  especially  German.  This  can  be  seen  in  Figure by  the  early  peaking  of  the  waveform  for  their  native language. In contrast, multilinguals did not show a statistically significant difference in the latency of the P200 component for any of  the  languages.  This  lack  of  differences  may  reflect  multilinguals'  reduced  familiarity  with  each  of  their  languages  since multilinguals'  speech  input  is  split  across  multiple  languages.  Therefore,  multilinguals'  P200  response  to  their  native  language would  be  more  similar  to  the  one  elicited  by  the  unfamiliar  languages  for  monolinguals.  The  results  point  in  the  direction  of different language discrimination strategies for multilingual and monolingual infants. While only monolingual infants show early discrimination of their native language based on familiarity, multilinguals perform a later processing pattern which is compatible with an increase in attention to the speech signal. This is the earliest evidence found for unique brain specialization induced by multilingualism. 14.7.1 [6]\nNeuroimaging studies suggest that monolingual infants activate a left-lateralized brain network in response to spoken language, which is similar to the network involved in processing spoken and signed language in adulthood. Left-lateralization to language refers to the brain processing language primarily on the left side. How does language experience, like being multilingual, impact this  left-lateralization  process?  To  answer  this  question,  researchers  conducted  a  functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy  (fNIRS) experiment  with  sixty  infants  between  the  ages  of  4  to  8  months  (Mercure  et  al.,  2020),  some  infants  were  spoken  language monolinguals  and  some  were  spoken  language  multilinguals,  but  neither  of  these  two  groups  had  ever  been  exposed  to  sign language. [7]\nFigure : Infants participating in an fNIRS experiment. 14.7.2 [8]\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures hemodynamic (blood flow) responses elicited from neuronal activation by shining near-infrared light into the brain. Figure shows an infant and a toddler wearing the fNIRS cap during an experiment. As this light passes through the head, some of it is absorbed by the blood flowing through the brain. When brains are active, they require oxygen from the bloodstreamGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif>the harder a particular area of the brain is working, the more oxygenated blood will be sent to that area and the more light will be absorbed there. Because the fNIRS cap measures how much light comes back out of the brain, the areas with less light shining through them are the most active. 14.7.2 [7] [9]\nFigure : Lobes of the brain.

In  multilinguals,  a  significant  increase  of oxygenated blood was observed in the right temporoparietal area. Results indicate that the neural tissue supporting language is plastic in infancy and influenced by language input and language modality (spoken modality versus signed modality), suggesting that there may be different neural paths to language development based on different language experiences. 14.7.4 [17]"

Many  claim  that  the  experience  of  multilingualism  leads  to  a cognitive advantage in executive functioning, a view that has gained substantial traction within the popular media. According to the prevailing  multilingual  advantage  hypothesis,  because  the  mental  representations  for  each  language  are  always  'turned  on', multilinguals become highly practiced at selecting and controlling attention after years of experience managing conflicts between competing phonological and lexical mental representations. Over the course of time, these practice effects generalize to problems outside the domain of language and contribute to a bilingual advantage in executive functioning (Bialystok, 2011, 2017; Bialystok, Craik & Luk, 2012; Kroll & Bialystok, 2013). Research suggests that potential cognitive advantages to being multilingual appear early, even within the first three years of life. [11]\nThe idea that each language known by a multiglinal is always 'turned on' suggests that even when they are speaking, writing, listening or thinking in one language, mental representations for the other language(s) are simultaneously activated (Kroll, Bobb & Hoshino, 2014). For example, Figure has three pictures in it: a piece of paper, cheese (wedges and slices) and a wrist watch. In an eye-tracking experiment, researchers showed participants arrays of stimuli containing multiple pictures (  Shook & Marian, 2012), similar to this. As participants looked at the pictures, they heard a statement that named one specific picture in the array and all the participants needed to do was look at the picture named. So if a participant was looking at the array of pictures in Figure and heard 'cheese', all they would need to do was look at the picture of cheese. Quite simple, huh? The results however revealed something interesting. 14.7.5 14.7.5\nFigure : Stimuli used to simultaneously activate multilinguals' mental language representations. ( ) 14.7.5 [12]\nSome of the participants looked at another picture before looking at the named picture in every trail. To find out why, we need to look closer to the backgrounds of the participants. In this study, participants included hearing English monolinguals and hearing American  Sign  Language(ASL)/English  multilinguals.  The  pictures  were  carefully  selected  to  contain  pictures  with  ASL translations that shared phonological features. The ASL signs for cheese and paper are phonologically similar. To illustrate, Figure shows the ASL signs for 'cheese' and 'paper'. These two signs share the phonological feature of handshape. The findings from the study revealed that the ASL/English multilinguals spent more time looking at signs that were phonologically similar to the named picture (  Shook & Marian, 2012). The results suggest that even though the study was conducted in English and did not involve ASL at all, ASL was simultaneously activated when English was activated. This study supports numerous others in finding that the mental representations of each language are always active in multilinguals (Kroll & Bialystok, 2013; Villwock, Wilkinson, Piñar & Morford, 2021). 14.7.6\nASL sign for cheese\nASL sign for paper\nFigure : ASL signs for cheese and paper. ( ) 14.7.6 [13]\nEnhanced cognitive abilities, mainly related to executive function, appear early, even in infancy and toddlerhood (Barac, Bialystok, Castro & Sanchez, 2014). Bilingual toddlers between 24 and 31 months of age show enhanced inhibitory control, another executive function, compared to monolingual toddlers (Crivello et al., 2016). A study even found evidence of enhanced cognitive abilities in infancy!  Seven  month  old  infants  have  greater  cognitive  control,  another  executive  function,  compared  to  monolingual  infants (Kovács & Mehler, 2009). [14]"

Despite  many studies claiming to show supportive evidence from sets of multilinguals tested across the lifespan, these multilingual effects are currently the subject of intense research debate. For example, in a study of over 11,000 people, when confounding variables were controlled for, multilinguals did not show any advantage in executive function (Nichols et al., 2020). As with adult studies, large meta-analyses on the overall research with multilingual children have found little support for a cognitive advantage (Gunnerud et al., 2020; Lowe, Cho, Goldsmith & Morton, 2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Supporting Heritage Languages\nAll young children in multilingual environments have the potential to learn multiple languages at the same time and develop a similar level of proficiency in each language (Albareda-Castellot, Pons, & Sebastián-Gallés, 2011; Pearson, Fernandez, Lewedeg, & Oller, 1997). Proficiency requires sufficient exposure and high quality learning opportunities in each language, however, in the U.S. this is rarely the case (Hoff et al., 2012), despite many parents expressing a preference for child care providers who speak the child's  heritage  language  (Ward,  Oldham  LaChance,  &  Atkins,  2011).  The  term  heritage  language  refers  to  a  language  that  is spoken at home, but not by the majority of society which uses the societal language. In the U.S. multilingual infants and toddlers are  more  likely  to  be  in  multilingual  care  when  they  are  9  months  old,  less  likely  at  24  months  and  very  unlikely  to  receive multilingual  childcare  services  once  they  are  52  months  of  age  and  attending  center-based  childcare  (Espinosa  et  al.,  2017). Multilingual children are exposed to their heritage language in child care less and less as they get older, reflecting the change from care primarily provided by relatives during infancy and early toddlerhood to more center-based care during later toddlerhood and during the preschool years. Relatives were most likely, and caregivers in centers least likely, to use the family's heritage language. This research suggests that in the U.S. multilingual infants and toddlers who attend childcare programs have fewer opportunities to develop proficiency in both of their languages as English-only learning is most commonly offered in center-based programs. [1] [2] [3]\nFigure : A caregiver interacting with infants. ( ) 14.8.1 [4]\nCenter-based  caregivers  can  do  a  lot  to  support  the  multilingual  development  of  infants  and  toddlers.  Caregivers  can  adapt pedagogical practices to include use of children's heritage languages in simple ways, such as with posters hung on the wall, books and songsGLYPH<c=0,font=/LiberationSerif> all  including  heritage  languages.  Encourage  active  engagement  with  family  and  community  members,  who  share  the same heritage languages as children, as an integral part of the classroom. If possible, hiring staff that use the same languages with enrolled children can be emphasized in job searches. Caregivers can also take the time to learn common words and basic phrases in a child's heritage language. [1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Language Quantity and Quality\nJust  like  with  monolingual  children,  the  quantity  and  quality  of  language  multilingual  children  are  exposed  to  is  important (Adamson et al., 2021; Grüter, Hurtado, Marchman & Fernald, 2014). Quantity refers to the amount of language and quality refers to how language is shared with children. Critically, the quantity and quality of the language environment provided by caregivers matters more than the language caregivers use (Song, Luo & Liang, 2021; Unsworth, 2016). Thus, caregivers should primarily communicate with infants and toddlers in the language(s) they are most proficient in so as to maximize the quality of their language input. [5]\nCaregivers who expose children to more language, have children with greater language abilities (Hoff, 2006; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). In one longitudinal study, Spanish/English multilingual toddlers were assessed at 30 months and then again at 36 months of\nage (Hurtado, Grüter, Marchman & Fernald, 2014). The results revealed that toddlers who were exposed to more language showed greater language abilities. Importantly, the amount of exposure in a particular language was related to the level of growth in that language.  So  for  Spanish/English  multilingual  toddlers,  children  who  received  a  higher  level  of  Spanish  exposure  relative  to English, showed greater development in Spanish compared to English. Some research has also found a cross-language relationship with multilingual children, showing that a strong foundation of a heritage language can support the acquisition of an additional language, like English (Cha & Goldenberg, 2015; Kim, Curby & Winsler, 2014; Willard et al., 2021). Spanish/English multilingual toddlers who had stronger Spanish language processing skills at two years of age had stronger English language skills at 4 ½ years of age (Marchman, Bermúdez, Bang & Fernald, 2020). This research is especially important as it provides scientific validation for supporting heritage languages in English-based childcare programs.\nQuality of language exposure can include various ways of sharing language with infants and toddlers. When children engage in more frequent and higher-quality language interactions with caregivers they demonstrate better long-term language and academic outcomes (Adamson et al., 2021; Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015; Huttenlocher et al., 2010; Pace et al., 2019; Storch & Whitehurst, 2002). Although  many  studies  focus  on  English-speaking  families  (Hirsh-Pasek  et  al.,  2015;  Masek  et  al.,  2021),  high-quality,  early language  interactions  also  support  the  communication  skills  of  children  from  other  cultural  and  linguistic  backgrounds.  For example, studies investigating Spanish-speaking caregivers' use of more complex, elaborative language, found that it promoted children's narrative skills (Escobar, Melzi & Tamis-LeMonda, 2017; Hammer & Sawyer, 2016; Luo et al., 2014; Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2014). Additionally, more frequent back-and-forth conversations in caregiver-child interactions when the children were 2.5 years of age predicted later language and literacy development in Spanish/English multilingual children (Adamson et al., 2021). [6]\nQuality language exposure can occur during any and every interaction caregivers have with infants and toddlers. Let's now discuss several strategies caregivers can use to improve the quality of language they share with children."

    "context_enriched_content": "Infant-directed Language\nWhen caregivers interact with infants, their speech often takes on specific, distinguishing features known as infant-directed speech (Fernald  et  al.,  1989).  Infant-directed  speech  (IDS)  is  produced  by  caregivers  of  most  (although  not  all)  linguistic  and  cultural backgrounds and is typically characterized by a slow, melodic, high-pitched, and exaggerated cadence (Broesch & Bryant, 2015; Farran, Lee, Yoo & Oller, 2016; Fernald et al., 1989). From early in life, infants tune their attention to IDS, preferring to listen to IDS over adult-directed speech at birth (Cooper & Aslin, 1990), as well as later in infancy (Cooper & Aslin, 1994; Cooper et al., 1997; Fernald, 1985; Hayashi, Tamekawa & Kiritani, 2001; Kitamura & Lam, 2009; Newman & Hussain, 2006; Santesso et al., 2007; Werker & McLeod, 1989). [7]\nFigure : Caregiver holding smiling infant up in arms. ( ) 14.8.2 [8]\nJust like monolingual infants, multilingual infants prefer to listen to IDS compared to adult-directed speech (Byers-Heinlein et al., 2021).  IDS  is  an  important  aspect  of  quality  language  exposure  to  infants  not  only  because  they  prefer  to  listen  to  it,  but  also because it is related to greater language growth (García-Sierra, Ramírez-Esparza, Wig & Robertson, 2021). Caregivers who use more IDS have infants and toddlers with greater language abilities (Kalashnikova & Carreiras, 2021; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013). Multiple studies have found that greater exposure to IDS is related to a larger vocabulary size in multilingual infants (RamírezEsparza et al., 2017; Rosslund, Mayor, Óturai & Kartushina, 2021;).

    "context_enriched_content": "Reading\nReading with infants and toddlers is a powerful way to increase both the quantity and quality of language they are exposed to. Just reading one picture book every day can lead to an increase of approximately 78,000 words each year (Logan, Justice, Yumus & Chaparro-Moreno,  2019).  Practices  such  as  shared  book  reading,  where  a  caregiver  reads  to  a  child,  can  support  language acquisition  (Dolean,  2021;  Escobar,  Melzi  &  Tamis-LeMonda,  2017;  Tsybina  &  Eriks-Brophy,  2010)  and  literacy  abilities (Rodriguez & Tamis-LeMonda, 2011; Sénéchal & LeFevre, 2002). However, some research suggests that caregivers may tend to emphasize  one  language  over  the  other  in  their  literacy  practices,  leading  to  unbalanced  exposure  to  children's  languages (Gonzalez-Barrero  et  al.,  2021).  Furthermore,  caregivers  often  lack  access  to  literacy  materials  in  heritage  languages  and multilingual formats (Ahooja et al, 2021; Mosty, Lefever & Ragnarsdóttir, 2013; Zhang & Slaughter-Defoe, 2009). For example, Vietnamese families in Taiwan have very few children's books in Vietnamese at home (Yeh et al., 2015) and Chinese families living in San Francisco have very few resources in Chinese for young children at home (Lao, 2004). [9] [10]\nFigure : Infant reading a book in Dutch. ( ) 14.8.3 [11]\nTo support the multilingual language development of infants and toddlers through reading, child care programs should have various age-appropriate  multilingual  books  that  represent  the  languages  of  the  children  enrolled.  Multilingual  caregivers  who  share  a heritage language with children, should read in their shared language. Child care programs can invite multilingual family members and community members to come into the program to read with children in their heritage languages. To improve access to ageappropriate  books,  child  care  programs  can  consult  enrolled  families  for  quality  books  and  even  create  multilingual  books themselves!\nMina shakes her head, \"Idon't want a blue dress\" .\nFigure : Page from a multilingual book in English and American Sign Language (Copyright; author via source) 14.8.4\nReading with all children, but especially with infants and toddlers, should be about more than just simply reading the words on the pages. To improve the quality of shared reading, caregivers can implement dialogic reading strategies. Dialogic reading strategies help caregivers create an interaction with a child during shared reading. Dialogic reading typically involves recasts, expansions, and open-ended questions in an attempt to scaffold the interactive reading experience, all of which have been shown to have a positive impact on a child's language development (Baker & Nelson, 1984; Cleave et al., 2015; Girolametto & Weitzman, 2002; Huttenlocher et al., 2010; Opel, Ameer & Aboud, 2009). These strategies are known as the PEER sequence. By implementing the PEER sequence, the caregiver: [12]\n- prompts the child to say something about the book,\n- evaluates the child's response,\n- expands the child's response, and\n- repeats the prompt to help the child learn from the expansion.\nA fundamental element of dialogic reading is the use of prompts to begin the PEER sequence while reading with a child. The acronym CROWD stands for five recommended prompts: [12]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Emotional Development\nIt  is  impossible to imagine life without emotion. We treasure our feelings: the joy at a ball game, the pleasure of a loved one's touch, or the fun with friends on a night out. Even negative emotions are essential, such as the sadness when a loved one dies, anger when treated unfairly,  fear  that  overcomes  us  in  a  scary  or  unknown  situation,  or  guilt  and  shame  when  our  wrongs  are  made public. Emotions invigorate life experiences and give those experiences meaning and flavor.[1]\nResearch  and  theory  often  divide  emotions  into  2  general  categories:  basic  emotions  (primary  emotions)  and  self-conscious emotions  (secondary  emotions).  Basic  emotions  appear  first  and  include  interest,  happiness,  anger,  fear,  surprise,  sadness,  and disgust. Self-conscious emotions include envy, pride, shame, guilt, doubt, and embarrassment. Unlike primary emotions, secondary emotions appear as children develop a self-concept and require social interactions to know when to feel such emotions (Akimoto & Sanbinmatsu, 1999) [1].\nThe  core  features  of  emotional  development  include  the  ability  to  identify  and  understand  one's  feelings,  accurately  read  and comprehend  emotional  states  in  others,  manage  and  express  strong  emotions  constructively,  regulate  one's  behavior,  develop empathy for others, and establish and maintain relationships (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2004). Infants experience,  express,  and  perceive  emotions  before  they  fully  understand  them.  In  learning  to  recognize,  label,  manage,  and communicate their emotions, and to perceive and attempt to understand the emotions of others, children build skills that connect them with family, peers, teachers, and the community[2] .\nFigure : Displaying Emotions.

Therefore,  people  may  have  different  emotional  experiences  when confronting similar circumstances. Several theories of emotion try to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another[1].\nBelow is a table of several theories surrounding emotional development. As an infant and toddler caregiver, it may not be necessary to understand each theory's details, but knowing multiple theories exist that explain the process of emotional development is important.\nThe theories outlined in the table come from[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Theories of Emotion\nJames-Lange Theory, Major Components = Emotions arise from physiological arousal You only experience a feeling of fear after physiological arousal takes place Different arousal patterns are associated with different feelings. Cannon-Bard Theory, Major Components = Physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously yet independently (Lang, 1994) Emotional reactions are separate and independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur. Facial Feedback Hypothesis, Major Components = A person's facial expression affects emotional experience (Adelman& Zajonc, 1989; Boiger &Mesquita, 2012; Buck, 1980; Capella, 1993; Soussignan, 2002) Suppression of facial expression lowers the intensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas &Ochsner, 2009). Intensities of facial expressions affect emotional reactions (Soussignan, 2002). If something insignificant occurs and you smile as if you just won the lottery, you will be happier about the little things than you would be if you only had a tiny smile If you walk around frowning all the time, it might cause you to have fewer. Schachter-Singer Two-Factor Theory, Major Components = Considers both physiological arousal and emotional experience Physiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience Depends on labeling the physiological experience, which is a type of cognitive appraisal. Cognitive-Mediational Theory, Major Components = Our appraisal of the stimulus determines our emotions This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response, and it is immediate and often unconscious The assessment precedes a cognitive label. Automatic Emotional Regulation (AER), Major Components = Non-deliberate control of emotions influences the things you attend to, your appraisal, your choice to engage in an emotional experience, and your behaviors after the emotion is experienced (Mauss, Bunge &Gross, 2007; Mauss, Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm &Gross, 2005) People develop an automatic process that works like a script or schema, and the process does not require deliberate thought to regulate emotions AER works like riding a bicycle. Once you develop the process, you just do it without thinking about it\nConstructivist Theory of Emotional Development, Major Components = Emotions are not built into the brain at birth, but instead, they are constructed based on your experiences Emotions are predictions that create an understanding of the world 2 identical physiological states can result in different emotional states depending on your predictions Example: A brain predicting a churning stomach in a bakery could lead to a brain constructing hunger. However, a brain experiencing a churning stomach while waiting for medical test results could lead a brain to construct worry. Thus, a brain can construct 2 different emotions from the same physiological sensations. Appraisal Theory, Major Components = You have thoughts (a cognitive appraisal) before you experience an emotion The emotion you experience depends on your thoughts (Frijda, 1988; Lazarus, 1991) Appraisal theory explains the way 2 people can have 2 completely different emotions regarding the same event\n- [1] Emotion and Motivation is shared under a CC BY 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by OpenStax\n- [2]  Stangor,  C.  and  Walinga,  J.

They  show  interest  in  pleasant  situations  that  bring comfort, stimulation, and pleasure, and they withdraw from unpleasant stimulation such as bitter flavors or physical discomfort. At around 2 months, infants exhibit social engagement in the form of social smiling as they respond with smiles to those who engage their positive attention (Lavelli & Fogel, 2005).\nSocial smiling becomes more stable and organized as infants learn to use their smiles to engage their parents and caregivers in interactions.\nFigure : grandparents [1] 15.4.1\nInfant\nsmiling\nat\nFigure Smiling[2]\n: 15.4.1\nInfant\n- [1] Image by Joy Poeng is licensed CC BY-NC\n- [2] Image by Rachel Klippenstein-Gutierrez is licensed CC BY-NC\n- [3] Image by Bethany Morgun is licensed CC BY-NC\nThis page titled 15.4: Emotional Beginnings is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor.\nFigure : infant smiling [1] 15.4.1"

As a construct, emotional regulation reflects the interrelationship of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors (Bell & Wolfe, 2004). This regulation requires effortful control of emotions and initially requires assistance from caregivers (Rothbart, Posner & Kieras, 2006).\nThe developing ability to regulate emotions has received increasing attention in research literature (Eisenberg, Champion & Ma, 2004). Researchers have generated various definitions of emotional regulation, and debate continues over the most valuable and appropriate way to define this concept (Eisenberg & Spinrad, 2004). Children's ability to regulate their emotions appropriately can contribute  to  perceptions  of  their  overall  social  skills  and  the  extent  to  which  peers  like  them  (Eisenberg  et  al.,  1993).  Poor emotional regulation can impair children's thinking, compromising their judgment and decision-making[1].\nFigure : Working on Self-Regulation.

Young infants have minimal capacity to adjust their emotional states and depend on their caregivers to help soothe themselves. By 4 to 6 months, babies can begin to shift their attention away from upsetting stimuli (Rothbart et al., 2006). Older infants and toddlers can more effectively communicate their need for help and crawl or walk towards or away from various situations (Cole, Armstrong & Pemberton, 2010). This aids in their ability to self-regulate. Temperament also plays a role in children's ability to control their emotional states, and individual differences are noted in the emotional self-regulation of infants and toddlers (Rothbart & Bates, 2006)[1].\nFigure : Standing toddler covering eyes.

Saarni  (1999)  specified  8  skills  of  emotional  competence:  (1)  awareness  of  one's  emotional  state,  (2)  ability  to  discern others' emotions, (3) ability to use the express terms of emotion, (4) capacity for empathic and sympathetic involvement, (5) ability to  discriminate  inner  and  outer  emotional  states,  (6)  capacity  for  adaptive  coping  with  emotions,  (7)  emotional  communication within relationships, and (8) capacity for emotional self-efficacy.\nFigure : All Smiles([2]) 15.7.1\nOne  critical  outcome  of  developing  emotional  competence  contributes  to  readiness  for  learning.  Emotional  competence  also contributes to the development of social relationships, both with single individuals (friendships) and groups (peer-group entry).[1]\nTheories  of  sociocultural  development  such  as  Vygotsky's  (1986)  argue  that  higher  order  psychological  functions  have  social origins. Children's cognitive, communication, and language development are all influenced by skills acquired during joint activities (Vygotsky, 1986; Winsler, Carlton, & Barry, 2000). This framework values communication and language as socioculturals tool for thought, self-regulation, and development of competencies, including emotional competencies. Vygotsky's theory of private speech may be critical for supporting the development of Saarni's (1999) proposed skills. Private speech can help children identify and label emotions (Skills 1-5) and may function as a tool for planning, guiding, and monitoring problem-solving activity (Skills 6-8).\n- [1] Understand and empathise is shared under a CC BY-SA license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by LibreTexts.\n- [2] Image by Marie Harris is licensed CC By-NC\nThis  page  titled  15.7:  Emotional  Competencies  is  shared  under  a  mixed  4.0  license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or  curated  by  Amanda Taintor."

In a classic experiment by Lewis and Brooks (1978), children 9 to 24 months were placed in front of a mirror after a spot of  rouge  was  placed  on  their  nose  and  their  mothers  pretended  to  wipe  something  off  the  child's  face.  If  the  child  reacted  by touching their nose rather than the \"baby\" in the mirror, it suggested that the child recognized the reflection as him or herself. Lewis and Brooks found that somewhere between 15 and 24 months, most infants developed a sense of self-awareness.[1]\nIn 2003, after extensive analysis of existing research, Phillippe Rochat established a theory around The 5 Stages of Self-Awareness. These stages outline how children learn to identify themselves and the caregivers in their lives as separate, distinct entities. The 5 stages span from birth until age 5 (Rocat, 2003).\nFigure : A young infant does not yet possess self-awareness. ([1]) 15.8.1"

Another sign of differentiation occurs when infants contact objects by reaching for them.

That can be hard to grasp (and  a  bit  terrifying  to  imagine)  (Kirsch,  2021).  It  is  important  to  note  that  Stage  4  permanence  develops  slowly.

    "context_enriched_content": "Developing Empathy\nDuring the first 3 years of life, children begin to develop the capacity to experience another person's emotional or psychological state (ZahnWaxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1990). The following definitions of empathy are found in research literature: \"knowing what another  person  is  feeling,\"  \"feeling  what  another  person  is  feeling,\"  and  \"responding  compassionately  to  another's  distress\" (Levenson & Ruef 1992, p. 234). The concept of empathy reflects the social nature of emotion, as it links the feelings of 2 or more people (Levenson & Ruef, 1992). Since human life is relationship-based, one vitally important function of empathy over the life span is to strengthen social bonds (Anderson & Keltner, 2002). Research has shown a correlation between empathy and prosocial behavior (Eisenberg, 2000). Prosocial behaviors such as helping, sharing, comforting, and showing concern for others illustrate the development of empathy (Zahn, Waxler, et al., 1992). The experience of empathy is thought to be related to the development of moral  behavior  (Eisenberg,  2000).  Adults  model  prosocial/empathic  behaviors  for  infants  in  various  ways.  The  behaviors  are modeled through caring  interactions  with  others  and  by  nurturing  the  infant.  Quann  and  Wien  (2006)  suggest  that  one  way  to support the development of empathy in young children is to create a culture of caring in the early childhood environment. \"Helping children  understand  the  feelings  of  others  is  an  integral  aspect  of  the  curriculum  of  living  together.  The  relationships  among teachers, between children and teachers, and among children are fostered with warm and caring interactions\" (p.28).[1]\n- [1]  California  Department  of  Education  (CDE  Press).

Specifically,  \"recent  cognitive neuroscience findings suggest that  the  neural  mechanisms  underlying  emotion  regulation  may  be  the  same  as  those  underlying cognitive processes\" (Bell & Wolfe, 2004, p. 366). Emotion and cognition work together, jointly informing the child's impressions of  situations  and  influencing  behavior.  Most  learning  in  the  early  years  occurs  in  the  context  of  emotional  support  (National Research  Council  and  Institute  of  Medicine,  2000).  \"The  rich  interpenetrations  of  emotions  and  cognitions  establish  the  major psychic scripts for each child's life\" (Panksepp, 2001). Together, emotion and cognition contribute to attentional processes, decision making, and learning (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1999).\nCognitive processes like decision making are also affected by emotion (Barrett et al., 2007). The brain structures involved in the neural circuitry of cognition influence emotion and vice versa (Barrett et al., 2007). Emotions and social behaviors affect the young child's ability to persist in goal-oriented activity, seek help when needed, and participate in and benefit from relationships. Young children who exhibit healthy social, emotional, and behavioral adjustment are more likely to have good academic performance in elementary school (Cohen et al., 2005; Zero to Three, 2004). Historically, the sharp distinction between cognition and emotion may be more of an artifact of scholarship than a representation of how these processes occur in the brain (Barrett et al., 2007). Recent research strengthens the view that early childhood programs support later positive learning outcomes in all domains by promoting healthy social-emotional development (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2004; Raver, 2002; Shonkoff, 2004; ) [1] .\nFigure : Toddler working to concentrate despite the presence of strong emotions.

    "context_enriched_content": "Exploring the Connection Between Language and Emotion\nYoung  children's  growing  language  skills  are  vital  to  their  emotional  development.  Language  opens  new  avenues  for communicating  and  regulating  emotions  (Campos,  Frankel,  &  Camras,  2004).  It  helps  children  more  effectively  negotiate acceptable outcomes in emotionally charged situations.[1]\nGrowing evidence from developmental and cognitive science demonstrates that knowing words helps infants and adults acquire and use language concepts throughout their lifespan; this evidence suggests that language is key to developing emotional structures. [2]\nPractitioners have theorized that infants use the phonological sound as a cue for differentiating between environmental sensations. This is particularly relevant for emotion categories, where the word anger, for example, can tie together multiple modalities of sensorimotor experience (such as bodily sensations, situations, or behaviors). These emotion categories also serve as \"glue\" for different  instances  of  anger  that  are  not  perceptually  regular  or  consistent  with  one  another.  For  example,  being  angry  at  one's computer may not look or feel the same as being angry about an insult. Emotion labels may be an important cue for helping infants and young children understand emotion categories and apply them to their own experiences and observations. No research has directly examined this hypothesis.[2]\nFigure : Reading with Infants is an important part of Language and Emotional Development (Image at Piqsels ) 15.11.1\n2-year-olds use the straightforward emotion labels \"angry\" and \"happy\" in daily interactions, yet 2-year-olds cannot distinguish between  more  specific  unpleasant  emotion  categories  until  they  start  reliably  using  additional  negative  emotion  terms  in  daily interactions (Widen & Russell, 2008). As children acquire emotional words and start using them in everyday life with caregivers, they  become  increasingly  competent  at  perceiving  and  labeling  facial  expressions  in  their  culture's  emotion  categories.  Just  as words  help  infants  generalize  between  otherwise  perceptually  distinct  objects  during  learning,  toddlers  show  a  \"language superiority effect\" when categorizing facial expressions. Language superiority effect means 2- and 3-year-olds are better able to accurately place pictures of facial expressions in a box labeled with a word (e.g., anger) as compared to a box labeled with a face (e.g.,  an  angry  face),  an  effect  that  increases  over  early  childhood  (Russell  &  Widen,  2002).  Studies  also  demonstrate  a  link between  children's  emotional  understanding  and  linguistic  development,  which  suggest  that  children's  advances  in  emotional understanding develop at the same rate as their advances in language comprehension (Harris et al., 2005).[2]\nCaregivers' conceptual knowledge about emotions and communication skills can transfer to their children. For instance, 2- to 4year-old children's emotional utterances correlate with the emotion labels that their mothers know and use (Cervantes & Callanan, 1998). Children whose mothers used more emotion terms when they were 18 months old were able to produce more emotion words at 24 months (Dunn et al., 1987). Children whose caregivers discussed emotions more when children were 36 months old also had better emotional understanding at 6 years of age (Dunn et al., 1991). An adult's explanation of internal states and attributes (such as hungry, sad, or nice) scaffold children's abilities to identify and describe the same experiences in themselves and others (Saarni, 1999; Yehuda, 2005). Use of words helps children acquire complex information about an emotion category (Lindquist, 2015) By contrast,  caregivers  who  lack  conceptual  knowledge  about  emotion  or  struggle  to  communicate  this  knowledge  with  words decrease the child's opportunities to develop a conceptual understanding of emotion.\n- [1]  California  Department  of  Education  (CDE  Press).

    "context_enriched_content": "Self-Efficacy\nAn infant's developing sense of self-efficacy includes an emerging understanding that he has abilities and can make things happen. Self-efficacy  is  related  to  a  sense  of  competency  and  identified  as  a  basic  human  need  (Connell,  1990).  The  development  of  a child's sense of self-efficacy may be seen in play or exploratory behaviors when they act on an object to produce a result. For example, a child pats a musical toy to make a sound come out. Older infants may demonstrate recognition of ability through \"I\" statements, such as \"I did it\" or \"I'm good at drawing.\"[1]\nYoung  children  have  little  understanding  of  what  they  can  and  cannot  do,  so  the  development  of  realistic  self-efficacy  is  a fundamental process:\n… Very young children lack knowledge of their own capabilities and the demands and potential hazards of different courses of action. They would repeatedly get themselves into dangerous predicaments were it not for the guidance of others. They can climb to high places, wander into rivers or deep pools, and wield sharp knives before they develop the necessary skills for managing such situations safely…Adult watchfulness and guidance see young children through this early formative period until they gain sufficient knowledge of what they can do and what different situations require in the way of skills (Bandura, 1986, p. 414).\nDuring infancy, the development of perceived causal efficacy (the perception that one affects the world by one's actions) appears to be an essential aspect of developing a sense of self. As the infant interacts with her environment, she can cause predictable events, such  as  the  sound  that  accompanies  shaking  a  rattle.  The  understanding  that  one's  actions  can  influence  the  environment  is something Alfred Bandura referred to as personal agency: the ability to act as an agent of change in one's world. The infant also begins to understand that certain events affect people differently than they affect the child. For example, if a model touches a hot stove, it does not hurt the infant, so the infant begins to recognize their uniqueness and actual existence as an individual. During this  period,  interactions  with  the  physical  environment  may  be  more  important  than  social  interactions  since  the  physical environment is more predictable and easier to learn about (Bandura, 1986, 1997). However, social interaction quickly becomes highly influential (Kelland, 2020).\nFigure : Young infants learn they can make things happen by interacting with their environment ([2]) 15.12.1\n[1]  California  Department  of  Education  (CDE  Press).

As infants grow, they become increasingly able to exercise voluntary control over behavior such as waiting for needs to be met, inhibiting potentially hurtful  behavior,  and  acting  according  to  social  expectations,  including  safety  rules.  Group  care  settings  provide  many opportunities  for  children  to  practice  their  impulse  control  skills.  Peer  interactions  often  offer  natural  opportunities  for  young children to practice impulse control as they learn about cooperative play and sharing. Young children's understanding or ignorance of requests made of them contributes to their responses (Kaler & Kopp, 1990).

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Emotional Expressions\nChildren express their emotions early in infancy through facial expressions, vocalizations, and body language.\nFigure : Infant crying. ([1]) 15.14.1\nInfants respond more positively to adult vocalizations containing a positive affective tone (Fernald, 1993). Tronick (1989) describes how the expression of emotion is related to emotional regulation and communication between mother and infant: 'the emotional expressions of the infant and the caretaker function to allow them to mutually regulate their interactions . . . the infant and the adult are  participants  in  an  affective  communication  system.'  (p.112).  It  appears  the  experience  of  positive  emotions  contributes significantly to emotional well-being and psychological health (Fredrickson, 2000, 2003; Panksepp, 2001). Neurophysiology and cognitive, social, and emotional factors play a part in the developmental process of social smiling (Messinger & Fogel, 2007). The ability to use words to express emotions gives young children a valuable tool in gaining assistance or social support (Saarni et al., 2006).  Temperament  may  also  play  a  role  in  children's  expression  of  emotion.  Young  children's  expressions  of  positive  and negative emotions impact developing social relationships. Positive emotions appeal to social partners and enable relationships to form,  while  problematic  management  or  expression  of  negative  emotions  leads  to  difficulty  in  social  relationships  (Denham  & Weissberg, 2004). The use of emotion-related words appears to be associated with how likable preschoolers are to their peers: children who use emotion-related words are typically better liked by their classmates (Fabes at al., 2001).[2]\n- [1] Image by Joy Poeng is licensed CC BY-NC\n- [2]  California  Department  of  Education  (CDE  Press).

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding and Awareness\nEmotions are expressed both verbally through words and nonverbally through facial expressions, voices, gestures, body postures, and movements. People constantly express emotions when interacting with others, and others can reliably judge those emotional expressions (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002; Matsumoto, 2001). Emotions have signal value to others and influence those around us and  our  social  interactions.  Emotions  and  their  expressions  communicate  information  to  others  about  our  feelings,  intentions, relationship with the target of the emotions, and the environment. Because emotions have this communicative signal value, they help solve social problems by evoking responses from others, signaling the nature of interpersonal relationships, and providing incentives for desired social behavior (Keltner, 2003). [1]\nFigure : Infant signals their needs through crying. ([5]) 15.15.1\nA parent's  belief  that  emotions  are  valuable  rather  than  dangerous  correlates  to  their  child's  ability  to  recognize  their  parents' emotional facial expressions (Castro et al., 2014). Avoiding emotional expression may create a more impoverished environment for the  child  to  practice  their  developing  emotion-relevant  skills  (Dunsmore  et  al.,  2009).  Additionally,  families  who  avoid  talking about  emotions  with  their  child  (due  to  a  belief  that  emotions  are  dangerous)  do  not  help  the  child  acquire  the  conceptual knowledge necessary for learning how to differentiate between different emotional facial expressions.[2]\nFigure : As infants develop language they begin to express their emotions in different ways. ([6]) 15.15.1\nRemarkably, young children begin developing social understanding very early in life. Before the end of the first year, infants are aware that other people have perceptions, feelings, and other mental states that affect their behavior and are different from the infant's mental states.[3]\nEmotion  is  displayed  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms.  In  addition  to  facial  expressions,  tone  of  voice,  behavior,  and  body language all communicate information about emotional states. Body language is the expression of emotion through body position or movement. Research suggests that we are sensitive to the emotional information communicated through body language, even when we're not consciously aware of it (de Gelder, 2006; Spielman, 2020; Tamietto et al., 2009).\nAlthough developmental scientists once strongly believed infants are egocentric-focused on their own perceptions and experience -they now realize the opposite is true. Infants at an early stage are aware that people have different mental states (Wellman, 2011). This motivates them to figure out what others are feeling, intending, wanting, and thinking, as well as how these mental states affect others' behavior. Infants are beginning to develop a theory of mind, and although their understanding of mental states begins simply,  it  expands  rapidly  (Wellman,  2011).  For  example,  suppose  an  18-month-old  watches  an  adult  repeatedly  try  to  drop  a necklace into a cup but fail each time. In this case, the child will immediately put the necklace into the cup himself, completing\nwhat the adult intended to do but failed to accomplish. In doing so, the child reveals his awareness of the intentions behind the adult's behavior (Meltzoff, 1995). Carefully designed experimental studies have shown that, by late preschool years, young children can understand that another's beliefs can be incorrect, memories can affect how you feel, and emotions can be hidden from others (Wellman, 2011). Social understanding grows significantly as children's theory of mind develops.4]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Understanding and Awareness\nHow do these achievements in social understanding occur? One answer is that young children are compassionate observers of other people. They make connections between their emotional expressions, words, and behavior to derive simple inferences about mental states (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2001). Some scientists believe that infants are biologically prepared to perceive people uniquely, as  organisms  with  an  inner  mental  life,  which  facilitates  their  interpretation  of  people's  behavior  regarding  those  mental  states (Leslie, 1994; Thompson, 2021) This is especially likely to occur in relationships with people the child knows well, which supports the ideas of attachment theory. Growing language skills give young children words with which to represent these mental states, such as 'mad' or 'wants', and talk about them with others. Thus, in conversation with their parents about everyday experiences, children learn much about people's mental states from how adults talk about them (\"Your sister was sad because she thought Daddy was coming home.') (Thompson, 2006b). Developing social understanding is based on children's everyday interactions with others and their careful interpretations of what they see and hear.[4]\nFigure : Relationships are an important part of emotional development (Image 329 on NappyStock) 15.15.1\n- [1] Hwang, H. & Matsumoto, D.

    "context_enriched_content": "Recognizing Emotions\nDespite different cultural emotional display rules, our ability to recognize and produce facial expressions of emotion appears to be universal.  Even  congenitally  blind  individuals  make  the  same  facial  expressions  of  emotions,  despite  never  having  had  the opportunity to observe these facial displays of emotion in other people. Research findings suggest patterns of activity in the facial muscles involved in generating emotional expressions: this was indicted in the late 19th century in Charles Darwin's (1872) book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals. Substantial evidence exists for 7 universal emotions associated with distinct facial  expressions.  These  include  happiness,  surprise,  sadness,  fright,  disgust,  contempt,  and  anger  (Figure (Ekman  & Keltner, 1997, Elkman et al., 1969, Ekman and Friesen, 1971). [1] 15.16.1\nHappiness\nSurprise\nSadness\nFright\nDisgust\nContempt\nAnger\nFigure : The 7 universal facial expressions of emotion (modification of work by Cory Zanker) 15.16.1\nIn terms of development, it appears that most of the facial components of human expression can be observed shortly after birth. Expressions  like  enjoyment  and  interest  are  present  from  the  first  days  of  life  (Sullivan  &  Lewis,  2003).  Researchers  initially thought  that  infants'  facial  expressions  corresponded  to  adults'  facial  expressions  (see  Differential  emotion  theory  in  Izard  & Malatesta, 1987), but it's now known that facial expressions in infancy are not present like their adult-counterparts (Oster, 2005). Emotion in infancy cannot be compared to emotion in adulthood. Sroufe (1996) described precursor emotions in infancy. Precursor emotions do not have the same degree of cognitive evaluation as emotions of adults. Sroufe described how wariness and frustration can manifest as crying and distress. This observation agrees with the study of Camras et al. (2007) that does not find different facial expressions for fear and anger at 11 months.\nDifferences between adult and infant facial expressions can also be linked to the motor structure of infant faces. Camras  et  al. (1996) noted that infants may produce facial expressions in an unrelated situation because of an enlarged recruitment among facial muscles during movement. For example, infants 5 to 7 months raise their brows as they open their mouth, producing an expression of surprise.\nHolodynski and Friedlmeier (2006) proposed that infants learned adult-like expressions from a sociocultural based internalization model: caregivers reproduced infant expressions in a selective and exaggerated form, allowing children to learn the connection between their emotion and a given facial expression.[1]\nThe appearance of adult-like expressions is not well understood (Oster, 2005). Bennett et al. (2005) showed that the organization of facial expressivity increases during infancy. 12-month-old infants showed more specific expression to a situation than 4-month-old infants.  It  seems  that  children  keep  learning  how  to  produce  facial  expressions  through  late  childhood.  Ekman  et  al.  (1980) demonstrated  that  the  ability  to  produce  facial  expression  improves  between  5  and  13  years.  However,  young  children  do  not\nperfectly produce all facial expressions. The production of facial expression depends on age and the targeted emotion. Joy is wellproduced at 3 years old while anger, sadness, and surprise are still not mastered at 6 years old. Field and Walden (1982) also found that positive emotions are easier to produce than negative emotions. However, Lobue and Thrasher (2014) asked children to imitate facial expressions of an adult and found no effects of age or emotion subtype on the production of facial expression for children between 2 and 8 years old.[2]\nFigure : Imitation of Emotion has varied and mixed research results ([4]) 15.16.2"

    "context_enriched_content": "Recognizing Emotions\nFacial  expressions  of  emotion  are  important  regulators  of  social  interaction.  This  concept  has  been  investigated  through  social referencing (Klinnert, Campos & Sorce, 1983), the process whereby infants seek out information from others to clarify a situation and then use that information to act. The strongest demonstration of social referencing to date comes from work on the 'visual cliff'.  In  the  first  study  to  investigate  this  concept,  Campos  and  colleagues  (Sorce,  Emde,  Campos,  &  Klinnert,  1985)  placed mothers on the far end of a \"cliff\" from the infant. First, mothers smiled at their infants and placed a toy on top of the safety glass to attract  them: infants invariably began crawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the mother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results varied according to the emotion expressed: no infant crossed the table when the mother showed fear, 6% crossed when the mother showed anger, 33% crossed when the mother showed sadness, and approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother showed joy or interest.\nOther  studies  provide  similar  support  for  facial  expressions  as  regulators  of  social  interaction.  In  one  study  (Bradshaw,  1986), experimenters posed facial expressions of neutrality, anger, or disgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition the babies showed in touching the object. The results for 10- and 15-month-olds were the same: anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, then neutrality. This study was later replicated (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004) using  joy  and  disgust  expressions,  altering  the  method  so  that  the  infants  were  not  allowed  to  touch  the  toy  (compared  with  a distractor object) until 1 hour after exposure to the expression. At 14 months of age, significantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched the toy when the infants saw disgust.[3]\n- [1] Thompson, R. (2021).

    "context_enriched_content": "Culture and Emotions\nBecause culture impacts how people display emotion, people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different cultural display rules of emotion. A cultural display rule is one of a collection of culturally specific standards that governs the types and frequencies  of  acceptable  emotional  displays  (Malatesta  &  Haviland,  1982).  Some  cultural  groups  appear  to  express  certain emotions more often than other cultural groups (Tsai, Levenson, & McCoy, 2006). Cultural groups also vary by the emotions and emotional states  they  value  (Tsai,  Knutson,  &  Fung,  2006).  For  example,  research  has  shown  that  individuals  from  the  United States express negative emotions like fear, anger, and disgust both alone and in the presence of others. In contrast, individuals from Japan only do so while alone (Matsumoto, 1990). Furthermore, individuals from cultures that tend to emphasize social cohesion are more likely to suppress emotional reactions so they can evaluate which response is most appropriate in each context (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Nakagawa, 2008). One study suggests that cultural differences in exposure to specific emotions through storybooks may contribute to young children's preferences for particular emotional states (such as excited or calm) (Tsai et al., 2007).[1]\nFigure : Expression of sadness can be culturally based. ([2]) 15.18.1\nCultures also inform us about what to do with our emotions-how to manage or modify them-when we experience them. This often occurs by managing our emotional expressions through cultural display rules (Friesen, 1972). These cultural rules are learned early in life and specify the management and modification of our emotional expressions according to social circumstances. Some are taught to laugh at their boss's jokes even when they are not funny; others learn that \"big boys don't cry\". Culture affects how individuals express their emotions and how people experience them. Emotional regulation is also influenced by culture and the historical  era  in  which  a  person  lives.  This  cultural  variability  in  regulation  processes  is  significant  (Mesquita  &  Frijda,  1992). \"Cultures vary in terms of what one is expected to feel, and when, where, and with whom one may express different feelings\" (Cheah & Rubin 2003, p. 3).[3]\nFigure : Expressing happiness together. ([3]) 15.18.2\nA crucial aspect of culture comes from the transmission of emotional meaning to its members: one way this occurs is through the development  of  worldviews  (including  attitudes,  values,  beliefs,  and  norms)  related  to  emotions  (Matsumoto  &  Hwang,  2013; Matsumoto  et  al.,  2008).  Emotion-related  worldviews  provide  guidelines  for  desirable  emotions,  which  facilitate  norms  for regulating individual behaviors and interpersonal relationships. Cultural backgrounds tell us which emotions are ideal and which are not (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). The cultural transmission of information related to emotions occurs in many ways, not the least of which is from caregivers to children (Schönpflug, 2009; Tsai, Louie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007). As a caregiver for infants and toddlers,  how  might  your  culture's  emotional  norms  conflict  at  times  with  the  emotional/cultural  norms  of  the  children  in  your care?[4]"

    "context_enriched_content": "A Strategy to Support Emotional Development\nEmotional Competence and Self-Regulation, ECSEL, is based on the emotional foundations of learning and cognition. ECSEL aims to  help  young  children  develop  emotional  competence  on  their  path  toward  effective  self-regulation.  It  teaches  emotional competence to children as young as infants, helping enhance emotion regulation, self-regulation, and promote a positive sense of self, mental health, and well-being .[1]\nPromoting the growth of self-regulation development and co-regulation from birth through age 2[1]\nInfancy (birth to age 1), Characteristics of Self-Regulation in Infants = Orient attention away from stressors Engage caregivers as resources for comfort Begin to self-soothe. Infancy (birth to age 1), How Caregivers Can Provide Co-Regulation = Interact in warm, responsive ways Anticipate and respond quickly to child's needs Provide physical and emotional comfort when a child is stressed Modify environment to decrease demands/stress. Toddlerhood (ages approximately), Characteristics of Self-Regulation in Infants = Begin to select and shift attention (attentional control) Adjust behavior to achieve simple goals Delay gratification and inhibit responses for short periods when there is structure and support Emotions are stronger than cognitive regulation Feelings of attachment support prosocial goals. Toddlerhood (ages approximately), How Caregivers Can Provide Co-Regulation = Reassure/calm the child when upset by removing the child from situations or speaking calmly and giving affection Model self-calming strategies Teach rules and redirecting to regulate behavior\nCaregivers of infants and toddlers must pay attention to and document children's feelings and emotional responses: suggest words for and help children name their feelings rather than telling children what they feel. This strategy gives children a vocabulary for feelings  and  communicates  that  they  are  the  ones  who  know  their  feelings  best.  Emotional  language  support  helps  children understand what causes their feelings. Offer children, rather than tell them, possible explanations to help determine the cause of their emotion. Pay attention to your own emotional responses as young children are keenly sensitive to tone of voice and facial expressions.  Model  respectful,  appropriate  expressions  of  emotion,  facial  expressions,  and  tone  of  voice  that  matches  feelings. Loud or intensely angry tones can be overwhelming and frightening for children.[2]\nCaregivers support regulation of emotions by learning each child's preferred way of being comforted. Identify or name for children what helps them feel comforted. Acknowledge when children seek comfort or comfort themselves. Collaborate with children in providing comfort for them. Keep in mind children are able to comfort themselves. Demonstrate acceptance for all of the feelings children express. Young children use social referencing, meaning they look to adults to \"read\" how things are going throughout the day. When someone is crying, a teacher can provide a calm, accepting, and empathic tone to help children learn that crying is natural  and  related  to  feelings  of  sadness,  frustration,  fear,  and  anger.  Likewise,  a  teacher  who  responds  calmly  when  angry  or afraid helps children learn that such feelings are valid and appropriate.[2]\n"

Answers may include the influences of parents, peers, temperament, a moral compass, a strong sense of self, and critical life experiences such as parental divorce.  Social  development  encompasses  many  influences  and  addresses  questions  about  how  people  uniquely  develop.  Are humans a product of nature or nurture? How enduring are the influences of early experiences? Social development refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers, and family. It includes positive changes, such as how friendships develop, and negative changes, such as aggression or bullying. The study of social development offers perspective on these and other issues, demonstrating the complexity of external impacts on developing infants and toddlers. [1]\n[1] Thompson, P. (2019).

Understanding social development requires looking at children from 3 perspectives that interact to shape development. The first is the social context where each child lives, especially the relationships that provide security, guidance, and knowledge. The second is biological  maturation  which  includes  developing  social  and  emotional  competencies  and  underlying differences of individual temperament. The third is a child's growing representations of who they are and the social world around them. Social development is best understood as the continuous interaction between these social, biological, and representational aspects of psychological development.[1]\nFigure : Social Development is an important part of forming peer relationships.

We  make  conscious  choices  in  life,  focusing  on  meeting particular social and cultural needs rather than purely biological ones. For instance, humans are driven by the need to experience the world as a trustworthy place, feel we are capable individuals, believe we can contribute to society, and possess confidence in having  lived  a  meaningful  life.  These  are  all  psychosocial  problems.  Erikson  divided  the  lifespan  into  8  crises,  usually  called stages. Each stage or crisis consists of psychosocial tasks to accomplish. Erikson believed that an individual's personality takes shape throughout his lifespan in the face of life's challenges. According to Erikson, successful development involves positively dealing with and resolving the goals and demands of each crisis. If a person does not resolve a crisis successfully, it may hinder his ability to deal with later crises.\n"

Initiative vs. guilt (3 -5 years): preschoolers like to initiate activities and emphasize doing things \"all by myself.\"\n4. Industry vs. inferiority (6-11 years): school-aged children focus on accomplishments and begin making comparisons between themselves and their classmates.\n5. Identity vs. role confusion (adolescence): teenagers try to gain a sense of identity by experimenting with various roles, beliefs, and ideas.\n6. Intimacy vs. isolation (young adulthood): in our 20s and 30s, we make some of our first long-term commitments in intimate relationships.\n7. Generativity vs. stagnation (middle adulthood): In our 40s through the early 60s, we focus on being productive at work and home and are motivated to feel that we've contributed to society.\n8. Integrity vs. despair (late adulthood): we look back on our lives and hope to see that we have lived well and have a sense of integrity because we lived according to our beliefs.\nThe first 3 stages form a foundation for discussions on emotional and social development during the lifespan.

    "context_enriched_content": "Crises of Infants and Preschoolers: Trust, Autonomy, and Initiative\nFrom the day they are born, infants face a crisis (in Erikson's paradigm) about trust and mistrust. They are happiest if they can eat, sleep,  and  excrete  according  to  their  schedules,  regardless  of  whether  their  schedules  are  convenient  for  their  caregiver. Unfortunately, a young infant is in no position to control or influence a caregiver's scheduling needs, so the infant faces a dilemma about how much to trust or mistrust the caregiver's helpfulness. It is as if the infant asks \"If I demand food (or sleep, or a clean diaper, etc.) now, will my caregiver be able to help me meet this need?\" Hopefully, between the 2 of them, caregiver and child resolve this choice in favor of the infant's trust: the caregiver proves to be adequate in attentiveness, and the infant risks trusting the caregiver's motivation and skill.[1]\nCaregivers who are consistently and appropriately responsive and sensitive to their infant's needs help the infant develop a sense of trust;  the  infant  will  see  the  world  as  a  safe,  predictable  place.  Unresponsive  or  inconsistent  caregivers  who  do  not  meet  their\ninfant's needs can elicit feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; the infant may see the world as unpredictable and unsafe. If infants are treated cruelly, or their needs are not met appropriately, they will likely grow up with a sense of mistrust for people in the world.[2]\nAs soon as the  first  crisis  resolves,  a  new  one  develops  over  autonomy  and  shame.  The  child  (now  a  toddler)  may  trust  their caregiver,  but  their  trust  contributes  to  the  desire  to  assert  autonomy  by  taking  care  of  basic  personal  needs,  such  as  feeding, toileting,  or  dressing.  At  this  stage  of  development,  you  will  often  hear  toddlers  say  things  like  'me-do-it'  as  they  exert  their autonomy. Given the child's lack of experience in these activities, self-care is risky at first: the toddler may feed (or use the toilet, dress  themselves,  etc.)  clumsily  and  ineffectively.  The  child's  caregiver  risks  overprotecting  the  child  by  criticizing  their  early efforts unnecessarily, causing the child to feel shame for even trying.[1] Erikson believed that toddlers should be allowed to explore their environment as freely as safety permits, fostering their understanding of independence that later grows self-esteem, initiative, and  overall  confidence.  If  denied  the  opportunity  to  act  on  their  environment  (within  developmentally  appropriate  measures), toddlers may begin to doubt their abilities, leading to low self-esteem and feelings of shame (Berger, 2005). Hopefully, the new crisis  resolves  in  favor  of  autonomy  through  the  combined  efforts  of  the  child  to  assert  independence  and  of  the  caregiver  to support the child.\nAbout  the  time  a  child  is  of  preschool  age  (3-5  years  old)  the  autonomy  exercised  during  the  previous  period  becomes  more elaborate, extended, and focused on objects and people other than the child. The child at an early education center, for example, may now undertake to build the \"biggest city in the world\" out of all available unit blocks, even if other children want some of the blocks for themselves. The child's projects and desires create a new crisis of initiative and guilt because the child soon realizes that acting on impulses or desires can sometimes negatively affect others: more blocks for one child may mean fewer for someone else. As with the crisis over autonomy, caregivers must support the child's initiatives whenever possible without making the child feel guilty for desiring to have or do something that affects others' welfare. By limiting behavior where necessary-but not limiting internal feelings-caregivers demonstrate support of this newfound ability to take the initiative. Expressed in Erikson's terms, the crisis resolves in favor of initiative.[1]"

His theory also focuses on the social expectations found in certain cultures, but not in all. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate well in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the transition into adulthood coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles offer fewer choices.[2]\n[1] Thompson, P.

    "context_enriched_content": "Social Cognitive Learning Theory\nSocial Learning Theory, or learning by watching others, was developed by Albert Bandura (1977). Social Learning Theory holds that  portions  of  an  individual's  knowledge  acquisition  can  be  directly  related  to  observing  others  within  the  context  of  social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences. Young children frequently learn behaviors through imitation: they learn by modeling or copying the behavior of others, especially when they do not know what else to do.[1] This is called observational learning. Bandura theorized that the observational learning process consists of 4 parts. The first is attention. To learn, one must pay attention to what one is observing. The second part is retention: one must retain the observed behavior in one's memory. The third part of observational learning, initiation, acknowledges that the learner must be able to execute or initiate the learned behavior. Lastly, the observer must be motivated to engage in observational learning (Bouton & Lang, 1960). Bandura's theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and experiencing its consequences, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors. Watching a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in previously learned behavior (Bandura, 1986, 2002).[2]\nFigure : Modeling behavior is a part of social development. ([3]) 16.4.1"

This concept  is  called  reciprocal  determinism.  An  example  of  this  might  be  the  interaction  between  parents  and  children.  Parents influence their child's environment, and children influence parents as well. Parents may respond differently with their first child than with their fourth. Perhaps they try to be the perfect parents with their firstborn, but by the time their last child comes along, they have very different expectations of themselves and their child. Our environment creates us, and we make our environment.[4]"

They  actively  explore  what  they  can  do  with  their  bodies,  people  close  to  them,  and  the environment.

([1]) 16.5.1\nInfants develop quickly by extending their abilities in all domains and creating more complex ways of relating to people and things. They send messages to adults in various ways and expect responses from adults. For example, when looking into the faces of adults, infants may see enlarged dilated pupils-a common sign of interest and pleasure-and, in response, they smile more (Hess, 1975). Children in the 3-to-4-month range show highly differentiated social-emotional behavior. By 3 months, infants learn to alter responses to adults according to how the adults respond to them: infants increase vocalizations when adults acknowledge these vocalizations with a smile, a vocal response, or light touch. The interest of others stimulates the infant's interest (Crick, 1984).

    "context_enriched_content": "Relationships and Social Development\nChildren's experiences of relationships contribute to their expanding repertoire of social skills and broadened social understanding. In these relationships, children develop expectations for specific people (for example, experiences that lead to secure or insecure attachments to parents), acquire knowledge of how to interact with adults and peers, and create a self-concept based on how others respond to them.[1] Relationships with parents, other family members, and caregivers provide critical context for infants' social development. Parents and caregivers are an infant's initial social partner, and the quality of this early caregiver-infant relationship has been linked to many different positive outcomes. Establishing close relationships with adults is related to children's emotional security, sense of self, and evolving understanding of the world around them. Interactions with adults are a frequent and regular part of infants' daily lives, and infants as young as 3 months of age have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the faces of unfamiliar adults (Barrera & Maurer, 1981). By 4 months of age, a child's power in relationships, along with the impact of these relationships, is evident. Infants become more skilled at reading others' behavior and adapting their own behavior. They also gain skills  to  make  themselves  more  engaging  and  effective  socially.  4-month-olds  will  send  clear  messages,  become  quiet  in anticipation as someone comes near to care for them, seek adults' attention with smiles and laughter, participate in extended back and forth interaction with others, and engage in simple social imitation.[2]\nClose relationships with adults who provide consistent nurturance strengthen a child's capacity to learn and develop. These special relationships influence the infant's emerging sense of self and understanding of others. Infants use relationships with adults in many ways:  for  reassurance  that  they  are  safe,  for  assistance  in  alleviating  distress,  for  help  with  emotion  regulation,  and  for  social approval  or  encouragement.  These  relationships  play  a  crucial  part  in  development  across  all  domains.  For  example,  parental responses to the infant's vocalizations support language development (see Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2014 for reviews) and direct gaze sharing between a parent and infant promotes connections and communication (Leong et al., 2017).[3]"

Before the end of the first year, infants are aware that other people have perceptions, feelings, and other mental states that affect their behavior and that differ from their own mental states.[1]\nChildren begin to understand other people's responses, communication, emotional expression, and actions during the infant and toddler years. These developments include an infant's understanding of what to expect from others, how to act, and which social scripts are used for specific social situations. Recent research suggests that infants' and toddlers' social understanding is related to how often they experience adult communication about the thoughts and emotions of others (Taumoepeau & Ruffman, 2008).[2]\n\"At each age, social cognitive understanding contributes to social competence, interpersonal sensitivity, and an awareness of how the self relates to other individuals and groups in a complex social world\" (Thompson, 2006, pg.26).

    "context_enriched_content": "Responding to Infants' Cues as Part of Social Development Through Joint Attention and Social Referencing\nHumans can actively engage with other people's mental states, such as when they enter situations of joint attention (Malle, 2022). Joint attention is described as the ability to coordinate visual attention with another person and then shift the gaze toward an object or event (Mundy, 1998); it does not require the gazer to be aware of the follower's reaction (Emery, 2000). The definition sounds more complicated than it is. If you point to an object around a 3-year-old, notice how you both check in, ensuring that you are jointly engaging with the object. Such shared engagement is critical for children to learn the meaning of objects: both their value (is it safe and rewarding to approach?) and the words that refer to them (what do you call this?). When I hold up my keyboard and show it to you, we are jointly attending to it, and if I say it's called \"Tastatur\" in German, you know that I am referring to the keyboard and not to the table on which it had been resting.[4]\nLiterature reports 2 main components of joint attention: (1) response to joint attention and (2) initiation of joint attention.\nResponding to joint attention is the ability to shift visual attention following another's social cues such as gaze or pointing, whereas initiating  joint  attention  is  the  ability  to  direct  another  person's  attention  through  gaze  or  gestures  with  the  aim  of  sharing  an experience (Seibert & Mundy, 1982). Responding to joint attention and initiating joint attention are considered interrelated aspects of  joint  attention,  emerging  at  different  times  during  development (Mundy  et  al.,  2007).  Responding  to  joint  attention  usually\ndevelops between 6 and 9 months of age, whereas initiating joint attention starts approximately at 9 months of age with significant variability across individuals.[5]\nFigure : Example of joint attention as both man and infant look at the same object.

    "context_enriched_content": "Social Referencing\nYoung children begin developing social understanding very early in life. Before the end of the first year, an infant is aware that other people have perceptions, feelings, and different mental states affecting their behavior.[1] An understanding that other mental states differ from the infant's own can be readily observed in the phenomena of social referencing. [1] Social referencing is the tendency of an infant to gather information from a caregiver to regulate his behavior in an ambiguous situation (in which the infant does not have enough information to decide how to react) (Fawcett & Liszkowski, 2015; Schieler et al., 2018;  Stenberg,  2009; Striano et al., 2006; Walden and Kim, 2005; Zarbatany and Lamb, 1985). Social referencing emerges around 7 to 10 months of age and forms a foundation for social learning and social appraisal in adulthood (Walle et al., 2017).[1]\nIn social referencing, an infant looks to a trusted caregiver's face when confronted with an unfamiliar person or situation (Feinman, 1992). If the caregiver seems calm and reassuring, the infant responds positively as if the situation is safe. If the caregiver looks fearful or distressed, the infant is likely to react with wariness or distress because the caregiver's expression signals danger. Infants display remarkable insight and awareness: even though they are uncertain about the unfamiliar situation, the caregiver is not. By \"reading\" the emotion in the caregiver's face, infants can learn about whether the circumstance is safe or dangerous, and how to respond. [1]\nIn the past, developmental scientists believed infants were egocentric-focused on their perceptions and experience-but research now indicates the opposite is true. From an early age, infants are aware that people have different mental states, which motivates them to figure out what others are feeling, intending, wanting, and thinking, and how these mental states affect their behavior. Infants are beginning to develop a theory of mind, and although their understanding of mental states begins very simply, it expands rapidly (Wellman, 2011)Social understanding grows significantly as children's theory of mind develops.[1]\nHow do these achievements in social understanding occur? Young children are remarkably sensitive observers of other people. They make connections between their emotional expressions, words, and behavior to derive simple inferences about mental states (e.g., concluding that what Mommy is looking at is in her mind) (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2001). This connection is especially likely to occur in relationships with people the child knows well, consistent with the ideas of attachment theory. Growing language skills give young children words with which to represent these mental states (e.g., \"mad,\" \"wants\") and talk about them with others. Through conversation with their caregivers about everyday experiences, children learn much about people's mental states from how adults  talk  about  them  (\"Your  sister  was  sad  because  she  thought  Daddy  was  coming  home.')  (Thompson,  2006).  Developing social understanding depends heavily upon children's everyday interactions with others and their careful interpretations of what they see and hear.[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Disturbances in Infant-Caregiver Relationships: Maternal Depression and Infant and Toddler Social Development\nInfants  repeatedly  participate  in  daily,  interactive  routines  with  their  primary  caregivers,  most  often  their  mothers.  An  infant  is typically  in  tune  with  the  emotional  signals  in  their  caregivers'  voices,  gestures,  movements,  and  facial  expressions.  Maternal depression compromises the infant and mother's ability to mutually regulate the interaction. Most commonly, depression impacts the  relationship  through  2  interactive  patterns  observed  in  depressed  mothers:  intrusiveness  or  withdrawal.  Intrusive  mothers display a negative affect and disrupt the infant's activity. The infant experiences anger, turns away from the mother to limit her intrusiveness, and internalizes an angry and protective coping style. Withdrawn mothers are disengaged, unresponsive, affectively flat and do little to support the infant's activity. Infants cannot cope with or self-regulate this negative state and develop passivity, withdrawal, and self-regulatory behaviors (e.g., looking away or sucking on the thumb) (Hart et al., 1998; Tronick, 1989).\nInfants  and  toddlers  of  depressed  mothers  can  develop  serious  emotional  disorders  such  as  infant  depression  and  attachment disorders (Luby, 2000). Early mental health disorders might be reflected by delayed development, inconsolable crying, or sleep problems. Older toddlers may exhibit aggressive or impulsive behavior. In early care and education settings, children with social and  emotional  problems  tend  to  have  a  hard  time  relating  to  others,  trusting  adults,  being  motivated  to  learn,  and  calming themselves to tune into teaching-all necessary skills to benefit from early educational experiences. Studies reveal the long-lasting effects of maternal depression. Older children of mothers depressed during infancy show poor self-control, aggression, poor peer relationships,  and  difficulty  in  school  (Embry  &  Dawson,  2002).  These  problems  increase  the  likelihood  that  the  child  will  be placed in special education, held back to repeat a grade, or drop out of school. Each of these problems can prevent a child from reaching optimal development, result in missed opportunities for success over the child's lifespan, and impose increased costs to society (Onunaku, 2005)."

Infants cannot talk, and toddlers and older children who are abused usually do not tell anyone about the abuse. They might not define it as abuse, they might be scared to tell a trusted adult, they might blame themselves for being abused, or they might not know with whom they could talk about their abuse. Whatever the reason, children usually remain silent, making it very difficult to know how much abuse occurs. Up-to-date statistics on the different types of child abuse in the United States can be found at the U.S. Children's Bureau website .[7]\nAll types of abuse are complex issues, especially within families. There are many reasons people may become abusers- poverty, stress, and substance abuse are common characteristics shared by abusers, although abuse can happen in any family.\nChildren who experience abuse or neglect are at risk of developing lifelong social, emotional, and health problems, particularly if neglected before the age of 2. However, it is essential to note that not all children who experience abuse and neglect will have the same outcomes.

Because people who have experienced multiple traumas do not relate to the world in the same way as those who have not had these experiences, they require services and responses that are sensitive to their unique experiences and needs.[9]\nFigure : An infant is held and comforted by adults([12]) 16.6.1\nToxic stresses, such as abuse and neglect, are strongly linked to poor health outcomes across one's lifespan and trauma-informed care  is  one  approach  to  caregiving  based  on  these  effects.

For  example,  as  infants,  children  get  their  first encounter  with  sharing  (of  each  other's  toys).

    "context_enriched_content": "Different Theories of Play\nCognitive theories presented a significant shift in theorizing about play by directing research toward the development of children's thinking  processes  and  intellectual  development.  Piaget's  (Piaget,  1962)  developmental  theory  suggests  that  children  progress through a series of distinct phases in their thought processes. According to his theory, children engage in types of play that mirror their current level of cognitive development. The role of play is to help them consolidate and practice recently acquired concepts and skills to prepare the child for the next spurt in learning and development. Vygotsky (1978) also believed that play has several roles  in  cognitive  development.  However,  he  differed  from  Piaget  in  maintaining  that,  when  children  play  before  they  become actualized in real-life situations, they reveal potential new abilities. By creating their own scaffolding, children stretch themselves in areas like self-control, cooperation, memory, language use, and literacy by using private speech to direct, control, and structure their play interactions (Bodrova & Leong, 1996). According to Vygotsky (Vygotsky, 1978), play promotes development by serving as a scaffold within the child's proximal development zone, helping them attain higher levels of functioning. Bruner (Bruner, 1972) focused on how childhood play contributes to problem-solving abilities that are important later in life. He argued that the means are more important than the ends when playing; children do not worry about accomplishing goals, which allows them to experiment with novel combinations of objects and behaviors that they are unlikely to try if under pressure to achieve a goal. Therefore, play promotes flexible problem solving, making it adaptively advantageous in human development and evolution.[2]\nStuart Brown (2010) argues that play is evolutionary and has the following properties:\n- Purposeless/done for its own sake\n- Voluntary\n- Inherent attraction\n- Freedom from time\n- Diminished consciousness of self\n- Improvisational potential\n- Continuation desire\nGray (2013) also provides a list of features to describe play (with some overlap of Brown's list). His conceptualization maintains that play:\n- Is directed and chosen by the child\n- Is as an activity in which the focus is not the end-state or a goal, but the means itself\n- Consists of a structure that comes from the minds of the players and not external constraints\n- Is imaginative and separate from real life\n- Involves mental non-stressed activity.[3]\nFigure :Play of all kinds is beneficial ([8]) 16.7.1"

She labeled 3 types as non-social (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and 3 types as social play (parallel, associative, and cooperative). The list below describes each type of play. Younger children engage in non-social play more than older children; by age 5, associative  and  cooperative  play  are  the  most common forms of play (Dyer & Moneta, 2006).[1]\nThis list explains how children's play changes as they grow and develop social skills.\nUnoccupied Play (Birth-3 Months) :  At this stage, an infant is making many movements with their arms, legs, hands, feet, etc. They are learning about and discovering how their body moves.\nFigure : Newborn exhibits Unoccupied Play ([9]) 16.7.1\nSolitary Play (3 Months-2 Years) : This is the stage when a child plays alone. They are not interested in playing with others quite yet.\nFigure : Example of Solitary Play ([10] 16.7.1\nSpectator/Onlooker Behavior (2 Years) : During this stage, a child begins to watch other children playing but does not play with them.\nFigure : Example of spectator/onlooker play.

As the child grows and matures, play's appearance, function, and implications may change.\nInfants gradually learn to identify commonalities with others and engage in social interactions. The development of such abilities relies on the personal experiences shared between people in specific contexts (Liebal et al., 2013). Social play may offer vibrant\nopportunities for children to acquire joint attention skills. Throughout the first year of life, during play especially, together infants and  their  caregivers  begin  to  construct  social  games,  such  as  peek-a-boo  (Bruner  &  Sherwood,  1976;  Fantasia  et  al.,  2014; Gustafson et al., 1979; ). Social attention is a crucial ability for the emergence of play situations. Social attention allows children to focus on other people's  characteristics  such  as  facial  expressions,  gaze  direction,  gestures,  and  vocalizations.  When  the  direction  of  another's attention  has  been  identified  (for  example,  through  gaze  following  or  point  following),  we  can  shift  our  attention  to  focus simultaneously on the same external object or event as our partner (Bourjade, 2017).[5]"

They also develop skills for managing conflicts, such as turn-taking, compromise, and bargaining. Before the age of 1, infants not only react emotionally to their peers' emotional states but also engage with them in simple  forms  of  interaction  involving  behaviors  within  their  motor  abilities.  For  example,  Vandell  and  Wilson  (Vandell,  1987) showed that interactions between infants become increasingly reciprocated from 6- to 9-months, as reflected by the presence of turn-taking.[7]\nIn order to foster adaptive social development, it is important to understand the factors contributing to establishing relationships with peers, such as empathy and prosocial behaviors (Howes, 1992; Sebanc, 2007; Vandell, 1980). Evidence suggests that before their first birthday, infants are sensitive and respond to their peers' emotions, which could represent potential precursors of empathy and prosocial behaviors (Decety, 2010; Decety, 2012; Geangu).[7]\nSocial interactions with peers also allow older infants to experiment with varying roles in small groups and in different situations, such  as  relating  to  familiar  versus  unfamiliar  children.  Interactions  are  stepping  stones  to  relationships.[6]  Over  time,  infants develop  close  relationships  with  children  they  know,  such  as  other  children  in  the  family,  childcare  setting,  or  neighborhood. Relationships with peers provide young children with the opportunity to develop strong social connections.\nToddlers' relationships with their peers have many positive developmental outcomes later on, including higher levels of emotional mental health and school success (Ladd, 1987; Tomada, 2005; Taylor, 1994; Vandell , 2000). A toddler's ability to empathize with her peers, to comfort and to share toys with them, increases her chances of becoming a friend or preferred play partner.\nYoung  children's  expression  of  positive  and  negative  emotions  may  play  a  significant  role  in  developing  social  relationships. Positive  emotions  appeal  to  social  partners  and  enable  connections  to  form,  while  problematic  management  or  expression  of negative emotions leads to difficulty in social relationships (Denham & Weissberg, 2004). In Fabes' 2001 study, children who used emotion-related words were better liked by their classmates ( Fabes et al., 2001).[6]\n- [1] Thompson, R. (2022).

Caregivers must spend time intentionally supporting the social-emotional development of infants and toddlers. Research indicates that the ways teachers interact with children is crucial in determining how they develop. (Curby and Brock, 2013) Early relationships are essential for healthy social-emotional development in infants. The most fundamental need of infants and toddlers is to have close, nurturing relationships that help them build a sense of emotional security.[1] Because of the social and relationship-based nature of young children's learning, responsive caregiving supports the foundation for most other learning in young children.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Research\nPrevious research shows that children's early experiences in outside-home care promote the development of both disadvantageous and  favorable  developmental  outcomes,  depending  on  the  total  amount,  the  quality,  and  the  timing  of  the  childcare  exposure (Maccoby and Lewis, 2003; Belsky, 2006; Vandell et al., 2010; Huston et al., 2015; Brownell and Drummond, 2018). Conclusions from the prior evidence in early childhood education and care tend to vary depending on the age of the child. For children aged 0-3 years, the research evidence is mixed, with some studies indicating benefits for outside-home care, some reporting negative effects, and some studies finding no effects at all (Melhuish, 2015). Several studies have shown that a high level of cumulative time spent in  outside-home  childcare,  especially  before  the  age  of  4.5  years,  is  related  to  elevated  levels  of  aggression,  assertiveness,  and disobedience in adolescence (Belsky, 2006; Vandell et al., 2010; Huston et al., 2015). By contrast, some studies have found that center-based  childcare  in  the  infant  and  toddler  years  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  social  competence  and  prosocial behavior  (Brownell  and  Drummond,  2018)  or  lower  levels  of  later  emotional  or  behavioral  difficulties  compared  to  informal childcare (Gomajee et al., 2017). Numerous studies have explored the benefits of center-based childcare, preschool and other forms of group-based care for children 3 years and older (Melhuish, 2015). Overall, previous findings suggest that the effects of early childcare depend on the child's developmental preparedness for outside-home care (e.g., metacognition and 'theory of mind' in the early years; Wellman et al., 2001; Chatzipanteli et al., 2014), as well as the characteristics of the care environment (such as quality of  care).  At  age  3,  children  typically  have  not  developed  sufficient  knowledge  or  skills  to  engage  in  social  interaction  without constant adult guidance (Rubin and Pepler, 1995; Huston et al., 2015). High quality, structural features in an early care environment (e.g., group size and/or child-to-staff ratio, and training, permanence, sensitivity and responsiveness of caretakers) have been raised as one major explanation for findings where center-based childcare may be beneficial even when the child is less than 3 years old (Brownell and Drummond, 2018).[1]However, high quality, center-based childcare can be challenging to achieve and maintain, which places more pressure on the child's developmental preparedness to cope in the care environment.\nMost  often,  center-based  care  from  ages  0  to  3  (or  even  up  to  4.5  years)  has  been  seen  as  a  risk  for  a  child's  later  social development (Belsky, 2006; Vandell et al., 2010). Yet some studies have shown that if center-based daycare is of sufficient quality, it may do no harm or even be beneficial for the socio-emotional development of children under the age of 3 (Gomajee et al., 2017; Brownell and Drummond, 2018). It is possible that due to the limited self-control, theory of mind, and language capabilities of a young child, the quality of childcare (e.g., peer group sizes and adult-to-child ratio) tends to matter more in the toddler years than in the preschool years, regardless of the form of care. This may explain why previous findings with children aged 0-3 years vary more than with older children: the benefits of group-based outside-home care for later development is more evident (Melhuish, 2015). Children closer to preschool age can cope in groups more independently than toddlers, likely making them less dependent on the quality of care.[1\n[1] Oksman E, et.al.,(2019) Associations Between Early Childcare Environment and Different Aspects of Adulthood Sociability: The 32-Year Prospective Young Finns Study.

    "context_enriched_content": "Supporting Social-Emotional Development\nDuring  the  first  4  months  of  life,  babies  begin  to  engage  with  the  world  and  its  people  (Advances  in  Applied  Developmental Psychology 1995). Infants' motivation to seek relationships and build knowledge drives them to move their bodies, focus their attention, and send and receive signals (the basis for development and learning in all domains). Their active engagement with the social and physical world works hand in hand with the care they receive from adults, especially when the adults are responsive to them.[1]\nNoticing  and  responding  during  this  rapid  developmental  period  can  be  challenging  for  caregivers.  To  be  in  tune  with  young infants, adults need to know when an infant wants a social response and when an infant is making a discovery through individual exploration and observation.[1]\nFigure :  Caregivers  should  spend  time  closely  observing  infants  to  help  support  their  Social-Emotional Development. [1] 17.3.1\nEarly care centers must establish policies and practices to support responsive caregiving, so infants learn to regulate their emotions and to develop a sense of predictability, safety, and responsiveness in their social environments. The importance is so great that research  experts  have  broadly  concluded  that,  in  the  early  years,  \"nurturing,  stable  and  consistent  relationships  are  the  socialemotional development key to healthy growth, development, and learning\" (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2000, p. 412). High-quality relationships increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for young children. Professionals working in childcare settings can support the social-emotional development of infants and toddlers in various ways: interacting directly with young  children,  communicating  with  families,  arranging  the  physical  space  in  the  care  environment,  and  planning  and implementing curriculum.\nEmotions drive early learning. Infants and toddlers are active, curious learners who experience pleasure when receiving a positive response from a nurturing adult or when making a discovery. This pleasure motivates children to continue engaging in positive interactions, exploring, and learning. The emotional responses of infants and toddlers communicate their interests and needs. It is important for caregivers to read infant and toddler cues to pick up on learning interests and meet needs. By reading emotional cues, caregivers determine whether to engage in interaction with a child or wait quietly to see what the child will do next. Emotional cues let teachers know if children are ready for more interaction, want more complexity added to their play, or are tired and need quiet time. Responsiveness to a child's emotional cues strengthens the teacher-child relationship and creates new possibilities for the child's learning in the social-emotional domain and in all other developmental domains.[2]\nChildren  are  learning  from  their  interactions  with  caregivers  every  moment  of  every  day.  Through  relationships  with  children, educators provide an environment in which children can learn and thrive in the company of a trusted adult. Caregiving routines offer  essential  social  experiences  and  support  for  infants  and  toddlers  because  they  happen  regularly  and  consistently.  By experiencing and participating in these routines, children learn what it means to be nurtured in a caring way. Children also learn to engage in reciprocal, responsive interactions in supportive relationships with adults.\nFigure :  Routine care, such as diaper changes, are great ways to build relationships and support social-emotional development. [3] 17.3.1\nCaregivers should understand how important adults are for modeling, demonstrating affection and responsiveness to the needs of young children, and teaching interaction attitudes and skills.[1]"

Bowlby (1969) observed that infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents or reestablish proximity to a missing parent. For example, he noted that children who had been separated from their parents would often cry, call for their parents, refuse to eat or play, and stand at the door in desperate anticipation of their parents' return. At the time of Bowlby's initial writings, psychoanalytic writers held that these expressions were manifestations of immature defense mechanisms operating to repress emotional pain. However, Bowlby observed that such expressions are common to many mammalian species and speculated that these responses to separation might serve an evolutionary function.[1]"

Pre-attachment Phase, Characteristics = The innate signals attract the caregiver (grasping, gazing, crying, smiling while looking into the adult's eyes). When the baby responds positively, the caregivers remain close by. The adults encourage the infants to remain close as it comforts them. Babies recognize the mother's fragrance, voice, and face. They are not yet attached to the mother and don't mind being left with unfamiliar adults as. Attachment in Making, Age = 6 weeks to 6 to 8 months. Attachment in Making, Characteristics = Infants respond differently to familiar caregivers than to strangers. The baby would smile more to the mother, babble to her, and become quiet more quickly whenever picked by the mother. The infant learns that their actions affect the behavior of those around them. They tend to develop a \"Sense of Trust\" where they expect the caregiver's response when signaled. They do not protest when they get separated from their caregiver.. Clear Cut, Age = 6 to 8 months - 18 months - 2 Years. Clear Cut, Characteristics = The attachment to a familiar caregiver becomes evident. Babies show \"separation anxiety\" and get upset when an adult they rely on leaves them. This anxiety increases between 6 -15 months, and its occurrence depends on the temperament and the context of the infant and the behavior of the adult. The child would show signs of distress if the mother leaves, but with the supportive and sensitive nature of the caretaker, this anxiety could be reduced.\nFormation of Reciprocal Relationship, Age = 18 months to 2 years. Formation of Reciprocal Relationship, Characteristics = With the rapid growth in representation and language by 2 years, the toddler can understand a few factors that influence the parent's coming and going and predict their return, leading to a decline in separation protests. The child can negotiate with the caregiver to alter their goals via requests and persuasions. The child depends less on the caregiver along with age.\n- [1] Attachment Through the Life Course by R.

She  found  that  adult  attachment  representations,  the  construct  of  how  adults  remember  their  own  childhood experiences, might influence the attachment categorization of their children. In attachment theory, it is important to distinguish attachment behavior and attachment bond. Attachment behavior is behavior on the part of the infant that promotes proximity to the attachment  figure,  such  as  smiling  and  vocalization  (Carlson  &  Sroufe;  Cassidy).  Attachment  bond,  however,  is  described  by Ainsworth and Bowlby not as a dyadic and reciprocal relationship existing between the infant and his caregiver but rather as the infant's interpretation of his relationship with his mother (Cassidy). Evidence supports the positive influence of secure mother-child attachment on later development (Slade & Aber, 1992). A secure attachment system serves as a foundation for the expression of emotions and communication in future relationships, provides opportunities for self-regulation of affect (the  ability  to  consider emotional processes before responding), and creates the potential for resilience (Belsky & Cassidy; Carlson & Sroufe; Cassidy; Karen, 1990).[1]\nFigure : The importance of secure attachments ([2]) 18.3.1\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a Creative Commons CC: BYNC-SA\n- [1] Image by Marie Harris is licensed CC By-NC\nThis page titled 18.3: Attachment Behavior vs. Attachment Bond is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Wendy Ruiz."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Experiment\nAinsworth continued studying the development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that measured an infant's attachment to their parent. The test is called The Strange Situation Technique because it is conducted in a context unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely to heighten the child's need for his or her parent (Ainsworth, 1979).[1]\nDuring the procedure, which lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone while the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for a minute to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant for a few minutes, and then the parent again enters, and the stranger leaves the room. A video camera records the child's behaviors during the session, which trained coders later code. The investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the caregiver leaving and returning to the room, referred to as the \"reunion.\" Based on their behaviors, the  children  are  categorized  into  one  of  four  groups.  Each  group  reflects  a  different  kind  of  attachment  relationship  with  the caregiver. One style is secure, and the other three styles are referred to as insecure. [1]\n- A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is present and may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and bring one to the caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be upset when the caregiver departs but is also happy to see the caregiver return.\n- A child with a resistant (sometimes called ambivalent) attachment style is wary about the situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the caregiver rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush to the caregiver, but then fails to be comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry and even resist attempts to be soothed.\n- A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.\n- A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent way of coping with the stress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the separation, but avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall to the floor. [1]\nThe Strange Situation Technique\n\n1, Event = Exploration with caregiver in the room. 1, Secure = Explores freely. 1, Insecure-Avoidant = High exploration, but unfocused. 1, Insecure-Resistant = Stays close to caregiver. 1, Insecure- Disorganized = Chaotic exploration. 2, Event = Stranger enters room and talks with caregiver. 2, Secure = May interact with stranger. 2, Insecure-Avoidant = Indifferent to stranger. 2, Insecure-Resistant = Afraid of stranger when caregiver present. 2, Insecure- Disorganized = Afraid or uncertain about stranger. 3, Event = Caregiver leaves room and child is left alone with stranger. 3, Secure = May be upset when caregiver leaves. 3, Insecure-Avoidant = Not upset when caregiver leaves. 3, Insecure-Resistant = High distress when alone with stranger. 3, Insecure- Disorganized = Unpredictable (may be upset or not). 4, Event = Reunion with caregiver. 4, Secure = Happy to see caregiver return. 4, Insecure-Avoidant = Ignores or avoids caregiver. 4, Insecure-Resistant = Ambivalent: wants contact with caregiver but is upset at them. 4, Insecure- Disorganized = Reacts to return of caregiver with distress\nHow common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit avoidant styles, and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be characterized as disorganized (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978).[1]\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a Creative Commons CC: BYNC-SA\nThis page titled 18.4: Ainsworth Strange Situation is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Wendy Ruiz."

    "context_enriched_content": "Harlow's Research\nWhen Bowlby was initially developing his attachment theory, there were alternative theoretical perspectives on why infants were emotionally attached to their primary caregivers (most often, their biological mothers). Bowlby and other theorists, for example, believed that there was something important about the responsiveness and contact provided by mothers. Other theorists, in contrast, argued that young infants feel emotionally connected to their mothers because mothers satisfy more basic needs, such as the need for  food.  The child comes to feel emotionally connected to the mother because she is associated with the reduction of primary drives, such as hunger, rather than the reduction of drives that might be relational in nature.[1]\nIn  a  classic  set  of  studies,  psychologist  Harry  Harlow  placed  young  monkeys  in  cages  that  contained  two  artificial  surrogate \"mothers\" (Harlow, 1958). One of those surrogates was a simple wire contraption; the other was a wire contraption covered in cloth. Both of the surrogate mothers were equipped with a feeding tube so that Harrow and his colleagues had the option to allow the surrogate to deliver or not deliver milk. Harlow found that the young macaques spent a disproportionate amount of time with the cloth surrogate as opposed to the wire surrogate. Moreover, this was true even when the infants were fed by the wire surrogate rather  than  the  cloth  surrogate.  This  suggests  that  infants'  strong  emotional  bond  with  their  primary  caregivers  is  rooted  in something more than whether the caregiver provides food per se. Harlow's research is now regarded as one of the first experimental demonstrations of the importance of \"contact comfort\" in establishing infant-caregiver bonds.[1]\n- [1] Attachment Through the Life Course by R.

    "context_enriched_content": "Creating a Model of Attachment\nAs research accumulated showing the long-term effects of the quality of attachment between young children and their caregivers, researchers became very interested in why - as in \"Why does attachment at an early age predict later aspects of social, emotional, and  cognitive  development?\"  They  began  exploring  possible  mediating  mechanisms  to  answer  this  question,  looking  for  the pathways through which attachment exerts its effects. Research has uncovered several mechanisms, including neurophysiological pathways (e.g., children in securely attached dyads have lower levels of stress reactivity), but among the most interesting are young children's (and the later older children's, adolescents', and adults') internal working models of close relationships (Crittenden, 1999; Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985).[1]\nAs attachment develops, day-to-day interactions between infant and caregiver form the basis of the infant's internal working model - a set of beliefs and expectations they build about the availability and reliability of their attachment figures (Sherman, Rice, & Cassidy, 2015). These internal working models are constructed starting at a very young age, about the age of four months, as soon as children can mentally represent their experiences. It is as if over the first few years of life infants are \"taking mental notes\" about how these important relationships function, and the effects of these expectations can be seen in the ways infants wait after sending out distress signals to see if their caregiver is on the way or they need to escalate their communications. The specific, repeated experiences  babies  have  with  their  caregivers  become  more  generalized  and  internalized  over  time,  indicating  whether  the attachment figure can be counted on for dependable comfort and protection in times of distress and serve as a secure base from which the infant can explore the world. This internal representation then informs what types of behavior can be expected from others, i.e., whether a person will pick them up when they are upset or should be turned to for comfort when sad.[1]\nAs children start to interact and form relationships with others, like other family members, preschool teachers, and peers, their internal  working  models  form  the  basis  of  their  expectations  for  how  people  will  respond  to  them  and  therefore  shape  their behavior in relationships. Negative experiences with one caregiver may, for example, create the expectation that people are not to be trusted. So young children are less able to be their authentic selves or reach out to others when they are upset and need comfort. Because these internal working models influence children's behavior, they may shape the quality of their subsequent relationships, all  the  way  up  until  adolescence  and  young  adulthood  (Allen  &  Miga,  2010).  For  example,  adolescents  with  insecure-resistant internal  working  models  may  show  ambivalence  about  close  romantic  relationships,  both  intensely  wanting  them  and  being resentful about how their needs are being met (Mikulincer, Shaver, Bar-On, & Ein-Dor, 2010).[1]\nThough these internal representations tend to stay somewhat stable for children with secure attachments, they can continue to grow and change as children age and gather more social experiences. For example, consistent, warm, and caring interactions with other attachment figures, such as grandmothers or preschool teachers, have the power to change those beliefs allowing children to rework a negative internal working model into a positive one. Internal working models can be reworked at any age, as children encounter family members, neighbors, teachers, or other adults who provide high-quality care. For adolescents, close and caring friendships can provide opportunities to reconsider and expand their understanding of relationships. The good news is that, as adults, we can become aware of our internal working models of relationships and see how we may be bringing things from previous relationships into subsequent ones in ways that are causing us problems. Then we can intentionally rework our expectations about others in ways that make it easier for us to form secure relationships with our friends, romantic partners, and eventually our children.[1]\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a Creative Commons CC: BY-\nNC-SA\n18.6:  Internal  Working  Models  of  Attachment  is  shared  under  a  not  declared  license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or  curated  by  Amanda Taintor & Wendy Ruiz."

A positive and strong support group can help a parent and child build a strong foundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes toward the newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher van den Boom (1994) randomly assigned some babies' mothers to a training session in which they learned to better respond to their children's needs. The research found that these mothers' babies were more likely to show a secure attachment style than the mothers in a control group that did not receive training.[1]\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a Creative Commons CC: BY-\nNC-SA\nThis page titled 18.7: Support for Caregivers is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Wendy Ruiz."

    "context_enriched_content": "Culture\nIn the years that have followed Ainsworth's ground-breaking research, researchers have investigated various factors that may help determine  whether  children  develop  secure  or  insecure  relationships  with  their  primary  attachment  figures.  Some  cultural differences in attachment styles have been found (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000). For example, German parents value  independence,  and  Japanese  mothers  are  typically  by  their  children's  sides.  As  a  result,  the  rate  of  insecure-avoidant attachments is higher in Germany, and insecure-resistant attachments are more elevated in Japan. However, these differences reflect cultural variation rather than actual insecurity (van Ijzendoorn and Sagi, 1999). [1]\nFigure : Infant and mother in India ([3]) 18.8.1\nOne of the critical determinants of attachment patterns is the history of sensitive and responsive interactions between the caregiver and the child. In short, when the child is uncertain or stressed, the ability of the caregiver to provide support to the child is critical for their psychological development. It is assumed that such supportive interactions help the child learn to regulate their emotions, give them the confidence to explore the environment and provide them with a safe haven during stressful circumstances.[2]\nIt is essential to note that the attachment theory work of Bowlby and Ainsworth focused on Westernized caretaking ideals in their determination of healthy, secure attachment. What is considered \"ideal\" in Westernized culture is not necessarily prioritized in other cultures.  Sensitivity  and  caution  are  required  in  determining  if  observed  attachment  patterns  are  adaptive  within  the  child's environment.[2]  Overall,  secure  attachment  is  the  most  common  type  of  attachment  seen  in  every  culture  studied  thus  far (Thompson, 2006).

Nearly all children between 18 months and 3 years old have separation anxiety and are clingy to some degree. [1]\nEven  securely  attached  toddlers  find  separation  challenging.  Separation  anxiety  can  be  seen  in  many  forms.  As  caregivers  or parents, we might see it in various ways. Some characteristics that infants and toddlers may experience are :\n- Tears at drop off\n- Asking to be held during transition times or for long periods throughout the day\n- Extra clingy during transitions\n- Challenges with nap, diapering, mealtime\n- Night terrors during sleep at home, or calling out a parent's name during sleep\n- Intense reactions and behaviors to situations that would not normally impact them."

    "context_enriched_content": "Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)\nAnother attachment pattern is reactive attachment disorder (RAD). Students with RAD typically have serious aggression problems, often hurting others and showing little empathy or remorse. Safety-seeking behaviors, anxiety, and depression are characteristic of the condition and an inability to be genuinely affectionate with others or develop strong connections. Students with RAD feel the need to be in control and may demonstrate bossy, argumentative, and defiant behaviors. Reactive attachment disorder is a mental health disorder diagnosed according to the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Here it is characterized as a stress-related disorder that can only be caused by a lack of adequate care (social neglect) during childhood. Children with RAD demonstrate withdrawn, internalizing type behaviors. RAD is only diagnosed in children and must be evident within the first five years of life.\nRAD is a deficit in the child's capacity to manage their feelings. If we think about RAD from the perspective of the child with it, characteristics could be described as follows:\n- I do relationships and conflict poorly because my social, emotional, and behavioral skills are ineffective in my interactions with others. My difficulties' frequency, duration, and intensity in many settings set me apart.\n- Why am I like this? My need for comfort, nurturing, and connection as a baby/young child were not met. My world is or has been one of neglect, fear, and hurt. As a result, I cannot articulate my feelings and thoughts.\n- I threaten, I throw tantrums; I am aggressive, I am demanding of your attention, I am manipulative, charming, and angry. Behaving like this is the only way I can control relationships. (Flaherty, 2011) [1]\nRemember that it is not our place to diagnose but to understand. Regardless of the type of attachment difficulty a child may have, they all need:\n- Safety\n- A caring adult who will be there\n- Emotional support\n- Understanding\n- Behavior support\n- Routines and consistency\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed CC BY-NC-SA\nThis page titled 18.10: Attachment Disorder is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Wendy Ruiz."

How do you compare your siblings or other children you have known well? Have you heard stories from your parents or grandparents about what you were like as a baby? If you have any videos of yourself as a baby, what do they depict about how you thought about the world? You may have noticed that some infants seem to be more comfortable, friendly or in a better mood than others and that some are more sensitive to noise or more easily distracted. These differences may  be attributed to temperament.

Temperamental traits  are  biologically  based  characteristics  present  early  in  life  that  contribute  to  individual  differences  in  regulating  and modulating emotion, attention, behavior, and motor activity (Rothbart, 1981, 2007; Gartstein and Rothbart, 2003) (Spinelli, Fasolo, Shah,  Genovese  and  Aureli,  2018).  Temperament  is  an  inherited  pattern  of  cognition,  emotion,  motivation,  and  behavior;  it  is influenced by experience (Terracciano et al., 2005; Roberts and Mroczek, 2008) but is mainly stable across the lifespan (Bouchard, 1994; McCrae et al., 2000; Roberts and DelVecchio, 2000). According to Rothbart et al. (2000), 'temperament arises from our genetic endowment. It influences and is influenced by the individual's experience, one of the outcomes is the adult personality.\" Although  some  theorists  argue  that  there  is  no  rigid  distinction  between  personality  and  temperament  (McCrae  et  al.,  2000), elements of temperament traditionally include behavioral dispositions from childhood to adulthood, observable in preverbal infants and generalizable to non-human animals (Rothbart et al., 2000; Clark, 2005) ) ( Fisher, Island, Rich, Marchalik, and Brown 2015). Because  development  emerges  through  bidirectional  interactions  between  the  infant  and  his  environment  (Sameroff,  1975), temperament can influence how the infant receives and responds to stimuli in his environment, impacting subsequent development.\n[1]\n[1] Fisher HE,  Island HD,  Rich J, Marchalik D  and Brown  LL  (2015)  Four broad temperament dimensions: doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01098 is licensed CC BY\nThis page titled 19.2: Overview of Temperament is shared under a mixed 4.0 license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or  curated  by  Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "Types of Temperament\nThomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig, and Korn found that these broad patterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable through childhood.[1] Based on the infants' behavioral profiles, most infants can be categorized into 3 general types of temperament.:[2]\nEasy, Percentage = 40%. Easy, Description = - Able to quickly adapt to the routine and new situations - Remains calm - Easy to soothe - Usually in a positive mood. Difficult, Percentage = 10%. Difficult, Description = - Reacts negatively to new situations - Has trouble adapting to routine - Usually negative in mood - Cries frequently. Slow-to-warm, Percentage = 15%. Slow-to-warm, Description = - Low activity level - Adjusts slowly to new situations - Often negative in mood\nThe percentages do not equal 100% as some children could not be placed neatly into one of the categories.[3] Approximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the 65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern, and 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its  strength  and  weakness,  and  one  is  not  superior  to  another.[4]  Children's  long-term  adjustment depends  on  the  fit  of  their  temperament  with  the  nature  and  demands  of  the  environment  in  which  they  find  themselves. Caregivers' responses appear to be more important than child temperament.[5]\n[1]  Culture  and  Psychology  by  L  D  Worthy;  T  Lavigne;  and  F  Romero  is  licensed  under  a  Creative  Commons  AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n- [2] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a CC BY- NC-SA 4.0,\n- [3] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a CC BY- NC-SA 4.0,\n- [4]  Culture  and  Psychology  by  L  D  Worthy;  T  Lavigne;  and  F  Romero  is  licensed  under  a  Creative  Commons  AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n- [5] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a CC BY- NC-SA 4.0,\nThis page titled 19.4: Temperament Styles is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Fit\nAn  important  aspect  of  Thomas  &  Chess's  (1977)  research  considers  the  interaction  of  child  temperament  with  caretaker personality and parenting style. They proposed that a match between the needs of a child's temperament with parental care would enhance the healthy development of self-regulation and the child's sense of self. This critical balance is known as goodness of fit. [1]  A  caregiver's  ability  to  accurately  read  and  work  well  with  a  child  determines  the  goodness  of  fit  between  the  child's temperament, parenting and caregiving. The goal for parents and caregivers in an infant or toddler center is to provide a good fit or match, meaning their styles align well and communication and interaction can flow. Temperamentally active children can do well with parents who support their curiosity but could have problems in a more rigid family.[2]\nThis goodness of fit between child temperament and parental demands and expectations can cause struggles. Rather than assuming discipline  alone  will  improve  children's  behavior,  temperament  knowledge  may  help  a  parent,  teacher,  or  other  caregiver  gain insight to work more effectively with a child. It is helpful to view temperamental differences as varying styles rather than 'good' or 'bad' behavior. For example, a persistent child may be difficult to distract from forbidden things such as electrical cords, but this persistence may serve her well in other areas such as problem-solving.[3]\nWhat  is  most  beneficial  about  the  goodness  of  fit  concept  is  that  it  does  not  require  adults  and  children  to  have  matching temperaments. The parent or caregiver does not have to change who they are; they can alter or adjust their caregiving methods to positively support their child's natural way of responding to the world. For example, if a child is highly active, a caregiver may pack extra activities in the diaper bag for waiting times at visits to the doctor, grocery store, etc. For a child who needs some extra time in approaching new activities, giving the child time to adjust and feel safe sets them up for more success.

    "context_enriched_content": "Factors Effecting Temperament\nThomas and Chess also studied temperament and environment. One sample consisted of white middle-class families with high educational  status;  Puerto  Rican  working-class  families  made  up  the  other  sample.  They  found  several  differences.  Parents  of middle-class children were more likely to report behavior problems before the age of 9, and the children had sleep problems. This report may be because children start preschool between the ages of 3 and 4. De Vries (1974) followed Masai (tribe in East Africa) infants  and  mothers  for  several  years  during  a  period  of  famine.  The  researcher  found  that  Masai  infants  who  were  more demanding were more likely to survive during periods of environmental stress than infants who were more docile. The researcher suggested that infants who were more aggressive and demanding - or in temperament terms, more difficult - were more likely to be fed and have their needs met than docile infants who might have been easier to ignore. The findings from these cross-cultural studies of temperament demonstrate how interaction between ecology, temperament, and culture impact an individual.[2]\n[1] Human Development by Human Development Teaching & Learning Group is licensed under a CC BY- NC-SA 4.0,\n[2]  Culture  and  Psychology  by  L  D  Worthy;  T  Lavigne;  and  F  Romero  is  licensed  under  a  Creative  Commons  AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licens\nThis page titled 19.6: Temperament, Culture, and Environment is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Influence of Language on Temperament\nThe developmental role of temperament has been primarily studied in the social-emotional domain, where it is usually associated with external and internal problems, challenging behaviors (i.e., Ullsperger et al., 2016; Rubin et al., 2017), and social competence (i.e., Baer et al., 2015; Penela et al., 2015). However, temperament also plays a role in language acquisition and partially accounts for  the  variability  in  how  much  language  a  child  has  and  how  language  is  acquired  (e.g.,  the  age  of  the  first  word  and  rate  of vocabulary development and syntactic emergence) during the first 2 years of life (Bates et al., 1991; Lieven, 1997). Research in the language domain focused on caregiver (typically parents) contributions, with a large portion looking into the mother's quality and input of language. These studies find consistent results on the impact of those factors on infant language outcomes (see Soderstrom, 2007  for  a  review).  Fewer  studies  exist  on  how  a  child  contributes  to  language  development,  such  as  the  influence  of temperamental  traits  on  language  acquisition.  One  potential  explanation  for  the  differences  in  available  research  studies  is  the failure  to  consider  an  approach  (Sameroff,  1975)  which  includes  both  the  child's  contributions  to  language  development  (i.e., temperament) and the caregiver's role (e.g., quality of the maternal input).[1]\nThe first year of life is characterized by the rapid emergence of the infant's ability to decode the streams of speech directed to them and  begin  to  associate  sounds  with  symbolic  meaning.  Two  characteristics  based  on  temperament,  attentional  control  and  the capacity  for  self-regulation,  are  thought  to  support  or  inhibit  language  development  (Canfield  and  Saudino,  2016).  However, research has not universally agreed on this point. Infants who demonstrated better attentional abilities also demonstrated higher language comprehension at the end of the first year (Dixon and Smith, 2000; Morales et al., 2000) and greater language vocabulary at 21 months (Dixon and Shore, 1997; Dixon and Smith, 2000; Salley et al., 2013). These findings suggest that greater sustained attention  to  the  environment  might  facilitate  a  child's  abilities  to  focus  on  events  rich  in  language,  contributing  to  vocabulary development. However, other research yielded contradictory findings (Kubicek and Emde, 2012; Pérez-Pereira et al., 2016). These disparities indicate a need for additional research. Overall, the literature suggests that greater expressions of positive affect may foster  more  significant  social  exchanges  in  infancy  (a  critical  period  of  language  development),  helping  facilitate  language development  in  the  infant  and  toddler  period  (See  Pérez-Pereira  et  al.,  2016,  Morales  et  al.,  2000,  Laake  and  Bridgett,  2014, Slomkowski  et  al.,  1992  and  Kubicek  and  Emde,  2012).  Another  body  of  literature  suggests  that  a  difficult  temperament  is adversely associated with language development. McNally and Quigley (2014) found that infants rated as having a more difficult temperament at 9 months had lower global language scores at 3 years of age, with similar associations demonstrated for infants at 21 months of age (Dixon and Smith, 2000; Salley and Dixon, 2007). One potential explanation contends that an infant's difficult temperament may interfere with his ability to control the attention needed to process language-relevant information, affecting his development during a critical period of language acquisition.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Influence of Language on Temperament\nDespite  research  suggesting  an  association  between  emotion  regulation  and  language  development,  additional  literature  has demonstrated contradictory findings. Some studies have failed to find an association between the negative affect in infancy (e.g., distress to limitations scale and difficult temperament) and language competencies in the toddler years (Dixon and Smith, 2000; Morales et al., 2000; Westerlund and Lagerberg, 2008; Canfield and Saudino, 2016). Adding to the complexity of the association between  emotion  regulation  and  language,  Moreno  and  Robinson  (2005)  found  that  greater  expressions  of  joy  and  greater expressions of anger at 8 months were associated with better expressive language at 30 months. This study indicates that emotional expression (both positive and negative) may facilitate language development by providing opportunities for the infant to develop language through exchanges with her caregiver (Molfese et al., 2010).[1]\nThese  contradictory  findings  suggest  that  while  attentional  and  emotional  temperamental  aspects  may  play  a  role  in  fostering interactions that enhance language development, further research is needed to clarify the association between attention, emotion regulation, and development of language competencies.[1]\n[1]  Spinelli  M,  Fasolo  M,  Shah  PE,  Genovese  G  and  Aureli  T  (2018)  The  Influence  of  Early  Temperament  on  Language Development: The Moderating Role of Maternal Input.

    "context_enriched_content": "Continuing Influences\nParents gaze into the faces of their newborn infants and wonder \"What kind of person will this child become?\" They scrutinize their  baby's  preferences,  characteristics,  and  responses  for  clues  of  a  developing  personality.  Temperament  is  a  foundation  for personality growth, but it is not the whole story. Although temperament is biologically based, it interacts with the influence of experiences  from  the  moment  of  birth  (if  not  before)  to  shape  personality  (Rothbart,  2011).  Temperamental  dispositions  are affected by the support level of parental care, and personality is shaped by the goodness of fit between the child's temperamental qualities  and  the  characteristics  of  the  environment  (Chess  &  Thomas,  1999).  For  example,  an  adventurous  child  would  find goodness of fit and supported personality growth with parents who regularly take her on weekend hiking and fishing trips. Much like the other facets of social development, personality results from the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience.\nPersonality  develops  from  temperament  in  other  ways  (Thompson,  Winer,  &  Goodvin,  2010).  As  children  mature  biologically, temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but temperamental self-regulation changes become more apparent as brain-based self-control capacities advance. For example, a newborn who cries frequently  doesn't  necessarily  have  a  grumpy  personality;  over  time,  with  sufficient  parental  support  and  an  increased  sense  of security, the child might be less likely to cry.\nPersonality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children's developing self-concept, motivations to achieve or socialize, values and goals, coping styles, sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other qualities are encompassed in personality. Biological dispositions and the child's experiences with others (particularly in close relationships) both guide the growth of individual characteristics.\nPersonality  development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn whose parents first gazed upon him becomes an adult with depth and nuanced personality.[1]\n[1] Thompson, R. (2022). Social and personality development in childhood CC BY-NC-SA.

Positive traits can be enhanced, and negative traits can be channeled; however, the child's underlying reaction style is unlikely to change.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Girl in the Window\nIn the summer of 2005, police detective Mark Holste followed an investigator from the Department of Children and Families to a home in Plant City, Florida to investigate a neighbor's statement concerning a shabby house on Old Sydney Road. A small girl was observed peering from one of its broken windows. The report seemed odd because no one in the neighborhood had seen a young child in or around the home, which had been inhabited by a woman, her boyfriend, and two adult sons for the past three years.\nWho was the mystery girl in the window?\nUpon  entering  the  house,  Detective  Holste  and  his  team  were  shocked.  It  was  the  worst  mess  they'd  ever  seen,  infested  with cockroaches, smeared with feces and urine from both people and pets, and filled with dilapidated furniture and ragged window coverings.\nDetective Holste headed down a hallway and entered a small room. He found a little girl staring into the darkness with big, vacant eyes. A newspaper report later described the detective's first encounter with the child: \"She lay on a torn, moldy mattress on the floor. She was curled on her side . . . her ribs and collarbone jutted out . . . her black hair was matted, crawling with lice. Insect bites,  rashes,  and  sores  pocked  her  skin  .  .  .  She  was  naked-except  for  a  swollen  diaper.  …  Her  name,  her  mother  said,  was Danielle. She was almost seven years old\" (DeGregory 2008).\nDetective  Holste  immediately  carried  Danielle  out  of  the  home,  and  she  was  taken  to  a  hospital  for  medical  treatment  and evaluation. Through extensive testing, doctors determined that, although she was severely malnourished, Danielle could see, hear, and vocalize normally. Yet she wouldn't look anyone in the eyes, didn't know how to chew or swallow solid food, didn't cry, didn't respond to stimuli that would typically cause pain, and didn't know how to communicate either with words or simple gestures such as nodding \"yes\" or \"no.\" Likewise, although tests showed she had no chronic diseases or genetic abnormalities, the only way she could stand was with someone holding onto her hands, and she \"walked sideways on her toes, like a crab\" (DeGregory 2008).\nWhat had happened to Danielle? Simply put, neglect. Only the basic requirements for survival were fulfilled in Danielle's care. Based on their investigation, social workers concluded that she had been left almost entirely alone in rooms like the one in which she was found. Without regular interaction-the holding, hugging, talking, explanations, and demonstrations given to most young children-she had not learned to walk or speak, eat or interact, play, or even understand the world around her. From a sociological point of view, Danielle had not been socialized.\nSocialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of society. It describes how people come to understand societal norms and expectations, accept society's beliefs, and be aware of societal values. Socialization is not the same as  socializing  (interacting  with  others,  like  family,  friends,  and  coworkers);  it  is  a  sociological  process  that  occurs  through socializing. As Danielle's story illustrates, even the most basic human activities are learned. Physical tasks like sitting, standing, and walking had not automatically developed for Danielle, and without socialization, Danielle hadn't learned about some material cultural  norms of her society: for example, she couldn't hold a spoon, bounce a ball, or use a chair for sitting. She also hadn't learned about her nonmaterial culture, such as its beliefs, values, and norms. Danielle didn't understand the concept of family and didn't know cultural expectations for using a bathroom for elimination. Most importantly, she hadn't learned to use the symbols that make up language, through which we learn about who we are, how we fit with other people, and the natural and social worlds in which we live.\nSociologists have long been fascinated by circumstances like Danielle's-in which a child receives sufficient human support to survive  but  virtually  no  social  interaction-because  they  highlight  how  much  we  depend  on  social  interaction  to  provide  the information and skills needed to be part of society or develop a \"self.\"[1]"

It happens in the United States, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia.[2] Families teach children, both directly and by example, how to behave and how the world works. Eurocentric cultures encourage children to use socially expected norms such as \"thank you.\" They teach kids how to dress appropriately for the culture in which their family is living. They introduce children to religious beliefs and the rituals that go with them. They even teach children how to think and feel. This uniquely human form of learning, where the cultural tools for success are passed from one generation to another, is called enculturation. Enculturation agents are individuals and institutions that shape individual adaptions to a specific culture to ensure growth and effectiveness.[3]\n- [1] Little and McGivern (nd) Introduction to Sociology - 1st Canadian Edition is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\n- 4.0 International License\n- [2] Kuppens, S and Ceulemans, E.

Each family has beliefs, values, and expectations rooted in cultural traditions that also reflect unique perspectives of the family. No two families follow cultural rules precisely the same way, and most families are connected to and influenced by multiple cultures. Williams and De Gaetano (1985) describe culture as a way of life of a group of people, including shared views of the world and social realities, values and beliefs, roles and relationships, and  patterns  or  standards  of  behavior.  Through  culture,  children  gain  a  sense  of  identity,  belonging,  and  beliefs  about  what  is important in life.[2]\nMuch cultural knowledge is transmitted implicitly. \"Before the start of formal education, children begin to acquire competencies and skills that the cultural group considers important for maturation and independence as an adult. Sometimes this is conveyed directly through intentional teaching by the family. These skills are often absorbed indirectly through select experiences provided in family life. For example, an older child may learn to take care of a younger one just by watching her mother or an older sibling\".[2]\n- [1] Introduction to Diversity Studies by Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is licensed under a CC BY-NC-CA\n- [2]  California  Department of Education, Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Program Guidelines, Second Edition by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 20.2.1: Agents of Socialization and Enculturation is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

Personalities also  affect  parenting  behaviors.[1]  Differences  in  caretaking  reflect  differences  in  parenting  goals,  values,  resources,  and experiences.[2]  Parents  who  are  more  agreeable,  conscientious,  and  outgoing  are  warmer  and  provide  more  structure  to  their children. Parents who are more agreeable, less anxious, and less negative support their children's autonomy more than anxious and less agreeable parents.[3]\nParents'  developmental  histories  (their  experiences  as  children)  also  affect  parenting  strategies.  Parents  may  learn  parenting practices  from  their  parents;  for  example,  fathers  whose  own  parents  provided  monitoring,  consistent  and  age-appropriate discipline,  and  warmth  are  more  likely  to  provide  this  constructive  parenting  to  their  children  (Kerr,  Capaldi,  Pears,  &  Owen, 2009).  Patterns  of  negative  parenting  and  ineffective  discipline  also  appear  from  one  generation  to  the  next.[1]  Regardless  of parents' specific choices, families play a pivotal role in exposing a child to early cultural learning. Many researchers believe that parents/families serve as the single, most crucial enculturation agent in any child's life.[2]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Family Functions\nMany family functions mirror parenting tasks, goals, and responsibilities. It is important to understand how family functions and parenting tasks impact each other. The following is a list of somewhat universal family functions (almost all families worldwide have some of these in common).[1] :\n- Economic support: providing basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, etc.\n- Emotional support: providing love, comfort, intimacy, companionship, nurturing, belongingness, etc.\n- Socialization of children: rearing children, parenting, helping children function to the best of their abilities within their society\n- Control of sexuality: defining and managing when and with whom (e.g., marriage) sexuality occurs\n- Procreation: contributing to the continuation of society and offspring\n- Ascribed status: providing a social identity (e.g., social class, race, ethnicity, kinship, religion, etc.) (Hammond, Cheney, Pearsey, 2015)\nWhile some parenting priorities are culturally universal, many childrearing values and habits are culture-specific. Culture-specific influences on caretaking choices can be subtle or overt and promote a narrative of what parents \"ought\" to do to successfully raise their children. For example, American parents are encouraged to enculturate a sense of independence and assertiveness in children, while  Japanese  parents  prioritize  self-control,  emotional  maturity,  and  interdependence  (Bornstein,  2012).  Every  society  places expectation on caretakers as enculturation agents to raise their young in ways that promote culture-specific goals and expectations.\n[2]\n- [1] Parenting and Family Diversity Issues by Diana Lang and Marissa L.

Parenting  practices  can  be  defined  as  directly  observable,  specific  behaviors  parents  use  to socialize  with  their  children  (Darling  and  Steinberg  1993).

    "context_enriched_content": "Definition: Parenting Practices\ndirectly observable, specific behaviors parents use to socialize with their children\nRather  than  focusing  on  specific  parenting  practices,  other  researchers  identified  overarching  parenting  dimensions  seen  in relationship modeling. Most scientists agree on at least two broad dimensions of parenting, labeled parental support and parental control.  Parental  support  is  the  affective  nature  of  the  parent-child  relationship,  indicated  by  showing  involvement,  acceptance, emotional  availability,  warmth,  and  responsivity  (Cummings  et  al.  2000).  The  parental  support  dimension  has  been  related  to positive  development  outcomes  in  children,  such  as  the  prevention  of  alcohol  abuse  and  deviance  (Barnes  and  Farrell  1992), depression and delinquency (Bean et al. 2006), and externalizing problem behavior (Shaw et al. 1994).[1]\nThe  parental  control  behavioral  dimension  consists  of  parenting  behavior  that  attempts  to  control,  manage  or  regulate  child behavior,  either  through  enforcing  demands  and  rules,  disciplinary  strategies,  control  of  rewards  and  punishment,  or  through supervisory functions (Barber 2002; Maccoby 1990; Steinberg 1990). Appropriate behavioral control has been considered to affect child development positively. In contrast, insufficient (e.g., poor parental monitoring) or excessive behavioral control (e.g., parental physical  punishment)  has  been  commonly  associated  with  negative  child  developmental  outcomes,  such  as  deviant  behavior, misconduct, depression, and anxiousness (e.g., Barnes and Farrell 1992; Coie and Dodge 1998; Galambos et al. 2003; Patterson et al. 1984). This parental behavioral control refers to control over the child's behavior; parental psychological control pertains to the parent's  attempt  to  manipulate  children's  thoughts,  emotions,  and  feelings  (Barber  1996;  Barber  et  al.  2005).  Due  to  the manipulative  and  intrusive  nature  of  psychological  control,  this  type  of  control  has  almost  exclusively  been  associated  with negative developmental outcomes in children and adolescents, such as depression, antisocial behavior, and relational regression (e.g., Barber and Harmon 2002; Barber et al. 2005). The three parenting dimensions (support, psychological control, and behavioral control) have been labeled as distinct concepts that are interrelated. (Barber et al. 2005; Soenens et al. 2012).[1]\nOther researchers have taken a different approach in studying parenting by emphasizing that specific combinations of parenting practices  impact  child  development  rather  than  separate  parenting  practices  or  dimensions  (e.g.,  Baumrind 1991;  Maccoby  and Martin 1983). This approach examines which patterns of parenting practices occur within the same parent and how these patternscommonly labeled as parenting styles-relate to children's development. It focuses on configurations within individuals rather than a variable-centered approach that focuses on relationships among individuals (Magnusson 1998).[1]"

She  introduced  three  parenting  styles  to  describe differences  in  typical  (she  used  the  term  normal)  parenting  behaviors:  the  authoritarian,  authoritative,  and  permissive  parenting styles. Baumrind (1971) suggested that authoritarian parents try to shape, control, and evaluate their children's behavior based on an  absolute  set  of  standards.  In  contrast,  permissive  parents  are  warmer,  less  controlling  and  grant  more  autonomy.  Baumrind considered an authoritative parenting style to fall between those two extremes."

Based  on  the  combination  of  two  dimensions  -  demandingness  and responsiveness - they defined four parenting styles: authoritative (i.e., high demandingness and high responsiveness); authoritarian (i.e.,  high demandingness and low responsiveness); indulgent (i.e., low demandingness and high responsiveness); and neglectful (i.e.,  low  demandingness  and  low  responsiveness).  These  parenting  dimensions  are  similar  to  parental  support  and  parental behavioral  control.  Based  on  Maccoby  and  Martin's  work,  Baumrind  (1989,  1991)  expanded  her  classification  with  a  fourth parenting style: the neglectful parenting style.[1]\nThis  work  consistently  demonstrated  that  children  of  authoritative  parents  had  the  most  favorable  development  outcomes; authoritarian and permissive parenting was associated with negative developmental effects, while results for children of neglectful parents were the poorest. Other researchers have also replicated these associations.\n- authoritative parenting style is associated with positive developmental outcomes in youth, such as psychosocial competence (e.g., maturation, resilience, optimism, self-reliance, social competence, self-esteem) and academic achievement (e.g., Baumrind 1991; Lamborn et al. 1991; Steinberg et al. 1994).\n- Findings regarding permissive/indulgent parenting have inconsistently yielded associations with internalizing (i.e., anxiety, depression, withdrawn behavior, somatic complaints) and externalizing problem behavior (i.e., school misconduct, delinquency), and also with social skills, self-confidence, self-understanding and active problem coping (e.g., Lamborn et al. 1991; Steinberg et al. 1994; Williams et al. 2009; Wolfradt et al. 2003).\n- An authoritarian parenting style has consistently been associated with adverse developmental outcomes, such as aggression, delinquent behaviors, somatic complaints, depersonalization, and anxiety (e.g., Hoeve et al. 2008; Steinberg et al. 1994; Williams et al. 2009; Wolfradt et al. 2003).\n- Children of neglectful parents have shown the least favorable outcomes in multiple domains, such as lacking self-regulation and social responsibility, poor self-reliance and social competence, poor school competence, antisocial behavior and delinquency, anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints (e.g., Baumrind 1991; Hoeve et al. 2008; Lamborn et al. 1991; Steinberg et al.\n1994).[1]"

We'll look at the first two now and explore the influence of culture later. The first issue relates to the psychological control dimension, which is currently  considered  the  third  parenting  dimension.  Initially,  Baumrind  paid  little  attention  to  the  role  of  psychological  control because her control dimension solely referred to parental socializing practices aimed at integrating the child into the family and society  (Darling  and  Steinberg  1993).  In  her  later  work  (1971,  1989,  1991),  Baumrind  incorporated  aspects  of  psychological control.  Limited  research  (e.g.,  Pereira  et  al.  2008;  Wolfradt  et  al.  2003)  has  identified  four  parenting  styles  that  match  the theoretically  distinct  styles.  Within  these  parenting  styles,  psychological  control  coincided  with  behavioral  control  levels  in  the authoritarian parenting style."

    "context_enriched_content": "When Parenting Styles Don't Align in a Family\nExisting  research  provides  little  insight  into  the  coexistence  of  different  parenting  styles  and  their  collective  impact  on  child development.  Although  Baumrind  included  both  parents  in  her  studies,  she  assigned  a  pre-defined  parenting  style  to  each  one separately. In some studies (1991), data was limited to mothers when both parents were assigned a different parenting style; in others (1971), families were entirely excluded. Baumrind, along with general research on parenting styles, paid less attention to the impact of joint parenting styles on child development (Martin et al. 2007; McKinney and Renk 2008; Simons and Conger 2007). Children in two-parent/two-unit households are influenced by the combined practices of multiple people (Martin et al. 2007), and some studies have shown that family members can differ in their parenting styles (Conrade and Ho 2001; McKinney and Renk 2008; Russell et al. 1998). When research considers how families' parenting styles combine, it aligns more closely with the real experiences of children growing up in two-parent households. Only this kind of approach can shed light on possible developmental effects (Martin et al. 2007). For example, Simons and Conger (2007) found that having two authoritative parents was associated with the most favorable outcomes in adolescents; additionally, one parent's authoritative parenting style generally buffered the less effective parenting style of the other parent. Similarly, McKinney and Renk (2008) suggested that in late adolescence, perceiving one parent as authoritative while the other parent offered a different parenting style partly buffered emotional adjustment problems.\n[1]"

Culture  may  affect  the  maternal  and  paternal  roles  and  control  [Albert,  Trommsdorff  and  Mishra, 2004]. Some research has found that maternal control gives the feeling of security and acceptance to Indian adolescents but not German adolescents (Eman and Abdel,2017) . While many children reared in European-American cultures fare poorly with too much strictness (authoritarian parenting), children raised in Chinese cultures often perform well, especially academically Chao, R.

Rozumah (2009) argues that parenting styles depend on the cultural context of the society, claiming Asian cultures are more collectivist than Western societies: the parenting outcomes valued in collectivist groups may form the basis for authoritarian parenting and be deemed more appropriate when compared with other parenting styles. These results are consistent with former results  reported  among  the  Palestinians  in  Israel  [Dwairy  M  2004a,b],  but  seem  to  contradict  other  findings  concerning  more strictness and oppression toward females than males in Arab societies (The Arab Woman Developmental Report, 2003). In a study of parenting styles of Egyptian adolescents [Dwairy and Menshar, 2006)], researchers found that parenting styles among Arabs are not as distinct as in the West. The three original parenting styles are not on a linear continuum where authoritarian and permissive styles exist at points on either side. Many studies using Baumrind's parenting prototypes found that most of their samples do not fit into any of the four styles [Marcus (1990 , Kim and Rohner, (2002)] (Eman and Abdel,2017)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Influences of Child Characteristics\nParenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents and caregivers affect their children, but children influence their parents or guardians. [2] A child's characteristics, such as gender identity, birth order, temperament, and health status, can affect child-rearing behaviors and roles. For example, an infant with an easy temperament may enable families to feel more effective, as they can easily soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant can elicit fewer positive reactions from family and may result in parents feeling less effective.[ Eisenberg et. al., 2008] Over time, parents and families of more difficult children may become more punitive and less patient with their children [Clark,  Kochanska,,  &  Ready,2000)  Kiff,  Lengua,  &  Zalewski, 2011]. Many parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their relationships and have more significant challenges in balancing work and family roles.[ Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith 2004).] Thus, child temperament is one of the characteristics that influences how parents and families behave with their children. Research also demonstrates that some parents talk differently with their children based on their child's gender identity, such as providing more scientific explanations to their sons and using more emotion words with their daughters [Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, & Allen, 2001].[3]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Influences of Family Structures\nThe family is central in children's lives because children learn about themselves and the world around them through experiences with  their  families.  \"Family  member\"  is  used  here  to  define  the  people  primarily  responsible  for  a  child,  including  parents, extended  family  members,  guardians,  and  foster  families.  Family  structures,  processes,  and  functions  must  be  assessed  to understand family members' roles in child outcomes.[Hammond, Cheney and Pearson, 2015].[3]\n\"Family structures\" delineate household members related by blood or legal ties; this concept typically assumes there is at least one child younger than 18 residing in the household. Specific structures include two-parent, one-parent, and living with neither parent (e.g., grandparents or other relatives rearing a child, families providing foster care, or children living in institutionalized settings), blended  families,  single-parent  plus  partner  families  (cohabiting  couples,  for  example),  multigenerational  families,  binuclear families, and adoptive families.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau utilizes these definitions of family structures:\nNuclear family: a child lives with two married, biologically related parents and only full siblings if siblings are present.\nCohabiting families: a child's parent lives with at least one opposite-sex, non-related adult. This additional adult may or may not be the child's biological parent.\nSame-sex cohabiting/married families: a child's parent lives with at least one same-sex, non-related adult. The additional adult may or may not be the child's biological parent.\nStepfamilies  and  blended  families  (terms  used  interchangeably):  children  who  live  in  a  household  formed  through  remarriage resulting in children living with one or no biologically related parents. The presence of a stepparent, stepsibling, or half-sibling designates a family as blended [United States Census Bureau, 2019].[1]\nCaregivers of infants and toddlers need to learn the diversity of the child's family structure and roles when welcoming children and their families into the program. Henderson and Mapp (2002, 10) highlight the importance of family by recognizing that \"all family members, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and fictive kin who may be friends or neighbors, often contribute in significant ways to children's education and development.\" It is essential for families to give information about important people and their relationships with each other and the child. Questions like, \"Tell me about your family?\" and \"Who are the important people in your child's life?\" will be more valuable than \"What is the mother's name?\" and \"What is the father's name?\" Family-centered care also recognizes the teacher's and program's roles in helping build networks and sustainable communities of support for families. These communities can support families years after leaving the infant and toddler program.[5]\n- [1] Kuppens, S and Ceulemans, E. Parenting Styles: A Closer Look at a Well-Known Concept.

    "context_enriched_content": "Poverty\nPoverty is a multidimensional, relational, and dynamic phenomenon, clearly illustrated through many definitions and indicators generated during the last 200 years by disciplines such as economy, sociology, political science, and anthropology (Spicker et al., 2006). In general, there are three main approaches to considering poverty: (a) as a material condition in which needs, a pattern of deprivations, and limited access to resources are the main components; (b) as an economic circumstance, in which standards of living, inequality, and the economic position are the main components; and (c) as a social circumstance, in which lack of basic security, exclusion, dependency, and social class are the most referred components.[1]\nContemporary literature surrounding poverty suggests the following as the most critical protective/risk factors:\n- prenatal maternal health (i.e., nutrition, exposure to environmental toxic agents and drugs, stressors)\n- perinatal health (e.g., prematurity, birth weight)\n- quality of early attachment\n- environmental stressors at home and schools\n- parenting and care styles\n- early cognitive and learning stimulation at home, care centers, and schools\n- parental and teachers' mental health\n- developmental disorders\n- family financial stress\n- access to social security and health systems; community resources\n- lack of social mobility\n- the social, political, and economic crisis\n- family, social, and cultural expectations about child development (e.g., discrimination, stigmatization, exclusion)\n- natural disasters (Bradley and Corwyn, 2002; Yoshikawa et al., 2012; Lipina, 2015; Ursache and Noble, 2016).\nIn addition, evidence suggests that the influences of poverty on cognitive development are due to the compilation of risk factors, the  accompaniment  of  adversities,  the  individual's  susceptibility  to  family  and  social  environments,  and  the  duration  of  the exposure (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005; McLaughlin et al., 2014; Wagmiller, 2015).[1]\nSince the mid-20th century, several researchers designed and implemented different intervention programs to reduce the negative impacts  of  poverty  on  cognitive  and  emotional  regulation.  These  efforts  have  emerged  simultaneously  within  the  humanities, social, and health sciences. This type of intervention program demonstrates that, given the multidimensional nature of childhood poverty and development, any intervention aimed at optimizing the conditions and opportunities for the development of children who live in poverty requires the same type of complexity. This involves designing multiple intervention modules that incorporate actions for children, families, teachers, civil organizations, and governments and developing the genuine integration of different conceptual and methodological perspectives.[1]\nThe rights to adequate nourishment, housing, education, and health care are listed in the UN General Assembly (1948, §§25-26). These rights are contested in different political systems and cultural contexts where there is a tendency to deny these rights as a social responsibility and, instead, explain poverty as a personal failure of the person afflicted (e.g., Feagin, 1972, 1975, and the review by Hunt and Bullock, 2016). Poverty is not regarded universally as unequal access to social benefits. These individualistic views are common in North America and South America, where the problem of poverty is immense, compared to western and northern Europe, where social views on poverty are more dominant. Countries and political systems accepting these rights as a shared social responsibility are among the countries most successful in combatting poverty, social violence, and insecurity [e.g., the Scandinavian countries (cf. Eurostat, or the World Bank Global Poverty Overview)].[1]\nEvidence from neuroscience renders the individualistic way of explaining poverty as a personal failure absurd. For example, an infant  does  not  choose  which  social  context  to  be  born.  When  the  infant's  brain  is  prevented  from  healthily  developing  due  to poverty and its surrounding social conditions (lack of adequate nourishment, housing, childcare, schooling, health care, etc.), it is not a question of personal failure. Parents cannot be held entirely responsible for an environment that does not provide each child with the means of healthy development. Neuroscientific evidence reveals how poverty may breach human rights and how it may prevent  a  child's  possibility  of  ever  enjoying  them.  It  is  a  crucial  discovery  of  how  poverty  may  cause  problems  in  the  very prerequisites for attaining development.[1]\n[1] Lipina SJ and Evers K (2017) Neuroscience of Childhood Poverty: Evidence of Impacts and Mechanisms as Vehicles of Dialog With Ethics is licesed CC BY"

    "context_enriched_content": "Other Types of Care\nFoster care is a system in which a minor is placed into a group home (residential childcare community, treatment center, etc.), or private  home of a state-certified caregiver (referred to as a foster parent), or with a state-approved family member. The child's placement is usually arranged through the government or a social service agency. The institution, group home, or foster parent is typically compensated for expenses unless the child is placed with a family member.(Wikipedia,202)].[1]\nThe foster care system has been around for years. According to The National Foster Parent Association, the United States foster care system developed from the English Poor Law of 1562. This law stated that children from poor homes would enter indentured services until they reached an age they could care for themselves. Children in foster care are often abused or neglected somehow, and  the  risk  of  repeated  abuse  is  very  high.  Foster  care  is  considered  a  short-term  intervention  and  usually  the  last  resort: immediately after removal, reunification is attempted to bring the child back to their family.[2]\nDisruptions in family and school change are factors that affect children in foster care more than their peers (Tordön, et al. 2020). Findings indicate that children exposed to early adverse childhood experiences in general [Minnis , Rabe-Hesketh , and Wolkind, n.d) and, more specifically, children placed in foster care have a heightened risk of attachment difficulties [Minnis , Everett , Pelosi ,  Dunn, and Knapp, 2006; Boris, Hinshaw-Fuselier, Smyke, Scheeringa, Heller, and Zeanah,2004]. Attachment difficulties have been related to other mental health problems among foster and adopted children [Millward, Kennedy, Towlson, and Minnis, 2006; Kočovská et al., 2012] (Lehmann, Havik, and, Havik, 2013). In one study by Lewis et al. (2007) on adopted children with and without the experience of placement instability, the authors found associations between instability in early placements and adverse effects on social-emotional development (Tordön, et al. 2020)\nChildren placed in foster care are also exposed to a range of other risk factors [Rutter, 1998]. Adverse childhood experiences, such as psychological and physical abuse and neglect, parental substance abuse, and mental illness, all increase the risk of physical and mental health problems and health risk behaviors [Repetti, Taylor, and Seeman, 2002; Essex, Klein, Miech, and Smider, 2001; Felitti et al., 1998; Gilbert, Widom, Browne, Fergusson, Webb, and Janson,2009; Turner, Finkelhor, and Ormrod, 2006; Flaherty and Sege, 2005]. Older age at placement, frequent placement changes, number of placements, and persistent adverse events after placement pose additional risks for these children [Tarren-Sweeney,2008; Jones et al.,n.d]. However, few studies have examined whether such risk factors show specific associations with certain types of mental disorders [McMahon, Grant, Compas, Thurm, Ey,2003] (Lehmann,Havik, and Havik et al.,2013).\n[1] Parenting and Family Diversity Issues by Diana Lang and Marissa L.

    "context_enriched_content": "Culturally Sensitive Care\nA person's approach to nurturing infants and toddlers reflects one's values. \"Every aspect of how parents and teachers care for, educate, and think about young children is embedded in cultural perspectives and beliefs. How you respond when children cry, how you decide it is time for them to eat, what you define as healthy and as sick, what you believe are appropriate clothes to wear, how you express love, what you expect to do for children, and what you expect them to do on their own are examples of the millions of ways that culture affects who we are as people, parents, and teachers\" (Keyser 2017). Familiar values may be considered natural, whereas  unfamiliar  values  may  feel  different  or  wrong.  Interactions  involving  differing  cultural  norms  can  create  feelings  of confusion,  discomfort,  curiosity,  and  judgment,  as  each  person  often  feels  their  norms  are  \"right'.  When  children  enter  care, children and families may be navigating an unfamiliar cultural context. During this process, caregivers need to maintain an open, interested demeanor with each individual and family to learn about their unique culture.\nSuppose an infant or toddler caregiver begins to feel uncomfortable with a family's practice with their child or the family's request for  a  certain  type  of  care.  This  presents  an  opportunity  for  the  infant  or  toddler  caregiver  to  think  about  their  values,  cultural influences, and how the family's values might be equally important and relevant in their cultural context. When learning about other  cultures,  it  is  important  to  suspend  judgment:  to  separate  understanding  of  cultures  from  judgments  of  their  values.  \"If judgments of values are necessary, as they often are, they will thereby be much better informed if they are suspended long enough to gain some understanding of the patterns involved in one's familiar ways as well as in the sometimes-surprising ways of other communities\" (Rogoff 2003). If teachers use these situations to grow in understanding and appreciation of multiple perspectives, they will more deeply understand their own and others' cultural influences.[1]\nLearning  about  others'  cultures  takes  time,  interest,  respect,  communication,  and  observation.  Since  many  cultural  beliefs  are learned implicitly, infant and toddler caregivers may not be experienced in articulating them. When a parent picks up her child from the blanket and hands him to you to say goodbye, she may not be able to verbalize \"I feel more comfortable knowing that I am physically giving you my baby to care for when I leave. I can't just leave when he is alone on the floor.\" This creates an opportunity for an infant and toddler caregiver to pick up on the parent's cue and hold the baby for goodbye or ask the parent next time \"Would you like me to hold Leo so he can say goodbye to you?\" When childcare centers ask parents to write down their cultural practices on intake forms, parents often do not know what to write or what this means. One effective way to learn about and uncover cultural practices is to ask parents about familiar routines and respectfully probe more deeply if the routines are different from the early learning and care culture (Tonyan 2015).[1]\nThe  early  childhood  profession  in  the  United  States  has  historically  emphasized  that  young  children  be  set  on  a  path  toward independence and encouraged to care for themselves as early as possible. Encouraging older babies to feed themselves reflects the profession's emphasis on independence, while many families value interdependence more than independence. This value can be observed in the ways children are taught to help one another and to respect the needs of others (such as staying at the table until everyone is finished). Early learning and care programs have begun to modify program practices and policies to weave the concepts of both interdependence and independence into the fabric of care.[1]"

For example, a caregiver might say to the child: \"I know you love to sleep in your swing at home. Your papa tells me how contented you are sleeping there. At school, I will help you nap, too. We can rock a little, and then I'll put you in your comfy bed and pat your back.\" The caregiver may tell the parent \"Thanks Tomas for letting me know how you help Benji sleep at home. It may take him a few days to learn a new way to go to sleep here, but I'll be sure to help him with a little extra rocking so it won't feel so different, and we can check in every day to see how it is going.\"[1]\n[1]  California  Department of Education, Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Program Guidelines, Second Edition by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 20.3: Providing and Supporting Culturally Sensitive Care is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

From the beginning of life, children learn the sounds of their family's language or languages and engage in interactions rooted in their family's culture. Supporting language development is critical because a child's home language develops hand in hand with all other domains. Responsive infant and toddler programs create a climate of respect for each child's culture and language. An essential part of being culturally and linguistically responsive is valuing and supporting each child's use of home language as they acquire English. Inviting parents to use their home language in the care setting, read to children, or do activities in their home language conveys to families that their culture and language are a vital part of the curriculum.[1]\n[1]  California  Department of Education, Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Program Guidelines, Second Edition by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 20.4: Influences of Language, Culture and Caregiving is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "Connection Between Caregivers and Parents\nThe relationship between the family and the caregiver is critical. For a family, the experience of entering an infant or toddler setting may be highly emotional. Family members often experience anxiety separating from their child and may feel conflicted  about leaving their child.\nCaregivers actively promote attachment between a child and her family. Learning about each child's unique family, particularly the family members and others who care for the child, supports the child's significant relationships. When a child has a disability or other delay, early interventionists may also have a role in the care process. The teacher is the bridge connecting the child and family during the day: the more the teacher partners with the family in supporting attachment with their child, the more successful the child will be in the program. This collaborative relationship between families and caregivers benefits children in many ways. The quality  of  the  relationship,  the  ease  of  two-way  communication,  and  the  mutual  respect  of  expertise  give  both  families  and caregivers the information necessary to provide the best care and education for the child. It communicates to the child that their world is working in synchrony. The more respect and comfort shared between families and teachers, the more comfortable and secure the child is.\nThe nature of relationships between programs and families has changed significantly. Historically, teachers and caregivers saw their role  with  parents  as  providing  parent  education  and  parent  involvement  opportunities,  both  more  deficit-driven  than  strengthsbased.  Currently,  there  are  more  strengths-based  and  collaborative  approaches  to  the  program-family  relationship.  These approaches include family-centered care, transformative family engagement, and a pedagogical approach from educators in Reggio Emilia, Italy. They believe that \"the participation of the families is just as essential as is the participation of children and educators\" (Edwards, Gandini, and Forman 1998, 21).[1]\nThe concept of family engagement (versus parent involvement) recognizes all members of a child's family (not just parents) and emphasizes the importance of the reciprocal relationship between families and schools. Program staff must be aware that family participation  in  both  the  program  and  the  home  can  take  on  many  forms  and  depend  on  each  family's  unique  characteristics (Halgunseth et al. 2009). Family engagement occurs when there is an ongoing, reciprocal, and strengths-based partnership between families and early care programs (Halgunseth et al. 2009).[1]"

Taking time to understand important  family  knowledge  is  key  to  supporting  infants'  and  toddlers'  healthy  psychological  and  physical  growth.  Equally important is the communication to the family letting them know about their child's day, sharing updates and information about the day, communicating moments when their child is thinking about them, and recognizing the loving interactions you see between the child and parent.[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Struggles and Challenges in Building Partnerships\nThere are times when caregivers struggle to find a way to respect and build trust with a family. The teacher may feel like family members are not trying, do not understand their child, are not responsive to their child's cues, or care for their child in inappropriate ways. An infant or toddler caregiver needs to determine if the child is safe, but it is also important to understand the family along a developmental and cultural continuum. When we think about child development, we expect an infant to go through specific steps in learning.  We  do  not  expect  him  to  walk  before  he  can  turn  over.  If  we  think  about  families  along  a  similar  developmental continuum, we may be better able to partner with them from a strengths-based perspective. For example, suppose a family is not reading their child's cues but is clearly excited to have a baby. In that case, you could acknowledge the love: \"It is so clear how much you love your baby. I can see it in your eyes\" and you could make a small observation: \"I notice when you move from one side of the stroller to the other that Sammy is watching you. He is so observant.\" In this way, you are using a strengths-based approach to leverage a new perspective for the parent. Sometimes differences of opinion arise between the program and a family about how to care for children. Addressing these differences often provides opportunities for teachers to learn and grow together with families. Teachers must initiate conversations with family members to learn their thoughts about caring for their child. Even when a family belongs to the same cultural community as the teacher, the teacher's perspective may differ from the family, as each person interprets cultural rules and expectations differently.[1]\nWhen issues arise involving cultural differences, educators can use the three-step procedure of Acknowledge, Ask, and Adapt. To acknowledge is  to  communicate  awareness  of  the  issue,  convey  sincere  interest  and  responsiveness,  and  involve  the  family  in seeking a joint solution. To ask is to learn about the parent's precise point of view by restating what the parent is saying and paying attention to verbal and nonverbal responses. To adapt is to work with family members toward a solution by searching for areas of joint agreement and negotiating on the crucial issues (adapted from Virmani and Mangione 2013, 72-5).[1]\n- [1]  California  Department of Education, Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Program Guidelines, Second Edition by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 20.5: Creating Positive Caregiver Parenting Relationships is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

Learning and development happen within the context of children's relationships with their families and teachers and the relationships between their families and teachers. Parents and teachers both play a central role in children's  learning.  The  relationships  children  form  in  their  early  years  are  critical  to  successful  learning  and  development throughout their lives. Educators of young children can engage with the family, culture, language, and community when building programs  and  developing  relationships.  Learning  how  to  build  authentic  collaboration,  two-way  communication,  reflective practice,  and  strong  communities  of  support  with  families  enables  teachers  to  honor  and  leverage  the  resources  and  multiple perspectives of the parent community.[1]\nThrough a welcoming relationship, the child's teachers begin to understand the family's perspectives, strengths, needs, routines, hopes, and expectations. As educators, when we understand there are many successful ways to care for and educate children, we can collaborate with parents to better understand the diversity of cultural perspectives through dialogue, listening, collaboration, and sensitive observation.[1]\n[1]  California  Department of Education, Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Program Guidelines, Second Edition by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 20.6: Conclusion is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Licensing and Regulations\nChild care quality is a concept with no easy answer and many different variables. The safety and health conditions of child care facilities, availability of learning materials, teaching qualifications, and caregiver and child interactions can determine the quality of  care  (Slot,  2018).  High-quality  child  care  programs  provide  long-lasting  positive  outcomes.  (see,  e.g.,  Abner  et  al.,  2013; Almond & Currie, 2011; Barnett, 2008; Burchinal et al., 2010; NICHD and Duncan 2003; Nores & Barnett, 2010). (Karoly, 2009). [1]\nSince it can be difficult for parents to easily tell just by observing a child center if the care is quality care, judgments about quality may not reflect the actual quality observed by experts in the field (Barraclough & Smith, 1996; Cryer & Burchinal, 1997; Cryer et al., 2002). Alternative approaches such as regulations, accreditation, licensing, and quality reporting systems are used to remedy this disconnect and improve quality in child care settings. Licensing and regulations are more accessible and less costly than other alternative routes to improve quality. These standards generally concentrate on a narrow set of readily observable quality aspects, such as group size, child-staff ratio, and cleanliness of the childcare setting, providing minimum quality standards (Karoly, 2009). The government has a role in setting and implementing the standards for child care quality through these approaches (Pekkurnaz, Aran, & Aktakke, 2021).[1]\nChild care quality generally aggregates into two broad categories: structural quality and process quality. The structural components of quality are generally more easily observed and evaluated and include infrastructure, staff-child ratio, education level and staff experience, and the child care facility (Burchinal, 2010; Helburn & Howes, 1996; Slot, 2018). Process quality refers mainly to the presence of developmentally appropriate equipment, materials, and learning activities, characteristics of the child-staff interactions, and the teaching style of educators when performing those activities in childcare settings (Burchinal, 2010; Helburn & Howes, 1996; Slot, 2018).

    "context_enriched_content": "Defining Types of Care\nIn  California,  licensed  providers  undergo  an  application  and  review  process  with  Community  Care  Licensing  (CCL)  and  are required  to  comply  with  specific  health  and  safety  regulations.  License-exempt  care  is  not  regulated  by  Community  Care Licensing, although there may be other government agencies that monitor their activities.\nFour main groups of childcare providers are exempt by California from obtaining a childcare license.\n- The first group includes individuals who care for a relative's children or who care for the children of one other family and their children. Certain parent cooperatives, in which families rotate care unpaid, are also exempt.\n- The second group includes public and private non-profit programs that offer recreational services. These programs include some community centers and most parks and recreation programs.\n- The third group includes businesses that offer limited childcare to their clients and customers. These programs usually require that the parent or guardian remain on the premises and that they remove their children within a specified amount of time.\n- A fourth group includes programs overseen by state agencies other than Community Care Licensing. For example, organized camps managed by the Department of Public Health and heritage schools that the Department of Education oversees.\n[1]"

These teacher-tochild  ratios  provide  developmentally  appropriate  support  to  children  of  different  ages,  from  infancy  to  school  age.  The  ratios outlined  by  Community  Care  Licensing  are  minimal.  Programs  should  always  look  to  increase  staffing  beyond  the  minimum requirements to promote positive adult/child relationships and high-quality learning experiences. Although many programs desire to increase rations, many factors make it difficult for programs to maintain even these minimal ratios. [1]\nTeacher-to-child ratios are based on several variables, including the number and ages of children in the facility and the nature of the care provided, such as naptime or outdoor play.\n- Infant centers serving children from birth to age 2 need to have a minimum ratio of 1 fully-qualified infant teacher for 4 infants.\n- In a room with more than 4 infants, up to a maximum of 12 infants, there must be 1 fully-qualified teacher responsible for the direct care and supervision of a maximum of 4 infants. In addition, if that fully-qualified teacher supervises aides with each aide accountable for the direct care and supervision of a maximum of 4 infants.\n- If Community Care Licensing has approved the Center to offer a toddler component, a minimum ratio of 1 fully-qualified teacher for 6 children and a maximum group size of 12 children with 2 teachers or 1 teacher and 1 aide must be maintained.[1]\nFigure : Six Toddlers and caregiver making playdough in large bin ([2]) 21.4.1\nThese ratios are the minimum required standards for health and safety. Especially when working with infants and toddlers, it is always recommended to increase the teacher-to-child ratio to better provide both small and large group activities for the children. Increasing these ratios also allows for more one-on-one time with individual children.\nAs described previously, teacher aides may be included in the ratio when certain conditions are met, including direct supervision by a teacher. The center director can be included in the ratio if actively engaged in teaching children. However, adults who provide clerical or custodial services do not qualify to be in the teacher-to-child ratio.[1]\nFigure :  1  teacher  for  every  four  infants.  Maximum  of  12  infants.  One  lead  teacher  can  supervise  two  aides  each  with  4 infants. ([2]) 21.4.1\nFigure :  One teacher for every 6 toddlers. Maximum of 12 toddlers. Maximum two teachers or one teacher and one aide. ([2]) 21.4.1\nEnsuring that qualified adults are present is critical to the safety of the children and it's important to develop a backup plan for teacher absences so that the minimum teacher-to-child ratios are always maintained."

Supervision helps prevent and minimize accidents and injuries in the child care setting and increases the quality of care. Supervision of children by caregivers must be 100% visual at all times, whether they are in the classroom, outdoors, or in any area of the child care center.

Items  that  need  to  be  kept  locked  up  include  guns,  ammunition,  and poisons. Organizing a childcare facility to keep harmful things that need to be accessible to providers but inaccessible to children, such as cleaning supplies, requires environmental planning. The use of locks on dangerous items is a great way to keep children safe from harmful things. In addition to locks, there are other ways to make items and areas inaccessible to children. If you place items in out-of-reach cabinets, shelves, or drawers, they can be considered inaccessible. Using products labeled as childproofing devices and safety latches can make items inaccessible. Failure to keep items and areas inaccessible as regulations require is a health and safety violation. Any item or space that could cause harm to a child must be made inaccessible.[1]\nFigure : Cabinet with locked door and sign.

A lock is a key or combination-operated mechanism used to fasten shut a door, lid, or the like. Products labeled as childproof devices and safety latches are not considered locks unless a key or combination operates them. Firearms and other weapons are not allowed on the premises of a child care center. In family child care homes, guns and ammunition must be locked in a gun safe or other storage units, guns must have a trigger lock on, or the firing pin may be removed from the firearm and stored separately. Weapons and ammunition must be stored apart from one another. There is zero tolerance  for  failing  to  keep  guns  stored  and  locked  as  required.

Licensing regulations that address  bodies  of  water  help  prevent  these  kinds  of  tragic  accidents.  Following  these  regulations  minimizes  the  risk  of  waterrelated accidents in child care.\nResearch has shown that an infant face down can drown in just 1 inch of water. So almost all bodies of water are considered a potential hazard and must be treated with caution.\nExamples include, but aren't limited to:\n- swimming pools\n- wading pools\n- hot tubs\n- creeks, streams, and ponds\nIf using a body of water such as a swimming pool or wading pool for organized play, supervise children closely. When the play session has ended, the equipment must be made inaccessible. Empty wading pools when not in use.\nOften, water tables are used in child care centers and family child care homes for children's play. An adult must closely supervise when water tables are in use.

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Primary Care\nHigh quality care and education for infants and toddlers begins with relationship-based care (Mangione, 2006). Primary caregiving is a relationship-based practice and is the practice of assigning each child (and family) to a caregiver who will serve as the primary source of information and care for the child. Primary caregiving enables caregivers to develop deep relationships with children and their families and offers opportunities to provide individualized care and interactions during daily routines and experiences. This focused  care  by  a  familiar  adult  can  provide  infants  and  toddlers  with  a  sense  of  predictability  and  security  that  comes  with knowing each child's unique needs and preferences. [1]\nFigure : Focused care is a benefit of a primary care system. ( ) 22.1.1 [2]\nPrimary caregiving does not mean that caregivers care only for their small group of children to the exclusion of the other children in  the  group.  Rather,  it  means  that  each  caregiver,  to  the  extent  possible  and  practical  in  a  group  care  situation,  cares  for  and responds to children's routine care needs (e.g., eating, toileting, diapering, sleeping) who are assigned to them. However, caregivers also work as a team and rely on each other as backup when they are not able to work directly with their particular children. For example, if a caregiver is busy changing one child's diaper, the other caregivers in the room still continue to provide care for the other children until their primary caregiver returns. Another reason why primary caregiving should be conceptualized as a team effort rather than exclusive care, is when a primary caregiver is not able to work (e.g., sickness, vacation, etc.,). It is imperative for all the caregivers to have respectful relationships and establish trust with all of the children, even those children outside of their primary care assignment. Of equal importance, parents and other family members know who has primary responsibility for their child; this can strengthen the parent-caregiver relationship and communication between home and the childcare program. [3]\nWhile primary caregiving is a common practice in the U.S., it is not a commonly implemented practice worldwide, even in highlydeveloped countries. In Singapore, for example, primary caregiving is not frequently practiced with infants and toddlers (Ebbeck et al.,  2015). However, in a different study with parents of children under three years of age in Singapore, most parents expressed wanting to have their child cared for by the same caregiver and parents in programs that did implement primary caregiving reported high levels of satisfaction with the practice (Ebbeck, Yim, Ho & Sharma, 2022).\nDespite the strong recognition of the importance of primary caregiving from organizations such as Zero to Three, the Program for Infant and Toddler Care (PITC) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), there is very little empirical evidence directly investigating primary caregiving as a practice (Lee, Shin & Recchia, 2016). The research that is used to justify the importance of primary caregiving comes mainly from empirical explorations into the development of attachment. Since primary caregiving is a practice that encourages the development of a secure attachment between caregivers and children, it is often assumed  that  primary  caregiving  would  also  support  the  positive  developmental  outcomes  associated  with  secure  attachment (Bernhardt, 2000; Lally & Mangione, 2017).\nFigure : Primary Care allows for focused care.

    "context_enriched_content": "Attachment\nAttachment theory was developed by John Bowlby in the 20th century to understand an infant's reaction to the short-term loss of their  caregiver  (Bowlby,  1969).  Bowlby  proposed  that  children  are  pre-programmed  from  birth  to  develop  attachments  and maintain proximity to their primary attachment figure(s), who was typically their mother but could be any person assuming the role of  caregiver  for  that  child.  He  used  the  term  'attachment'  in  a  conscious  effort  to  move  away  from  deficit  terms  such  as 'dependency'  and  'over  dependency',  which  were  historically  used  to  explain  what  Bowlby  coined  as  'attachment  behaviors' (Bowlby, 1969). Defined as 'seeking and maintaining proximity to another individual' (Bowlby, 1969), attachment behaviors allow infants and toddlers to stay close to their attachment figure by either demonstrating signaling behaviors such as crying and smiling, or approach behaviors such as following and clinging (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). [1]\nThe research on attachment relationships has important implications for supporting the implementation of primary caregiving. The first  year  of  life  is  considered  a  critical  period  for  attachment  development  and  infants  and  toddlers  require  a  secure  base  in childcare  settings,  in  addition  to  the  home  setting,  to  develop  secure  attachments  (Lee,  2016).  It  is  critical  that  caregivers understand  the  importance  of  secure  relationships  and  their  impact  on  children's  future  wellbeing.  Instead  of  a  single  primary attachment figure, children need access to consistently available attachment figures who can include a combination of their mother, father  or  paid  caregiver(s)  (Brown  et  al.,  2022;  van  IJzendoorn  et  al.,  1992).  As  a  result  of  a  network  of  attachment  figures, children's secure base is maintained when separating from a specific attachment figure. [1]\nDecades of longitudinal research have supported the notion that individual differences in children's attachment security to primary caregivers are of critical importance for children's social, emotional, and cognitive development. Several meta-analyses suggest that variations in attachment security are associated with individual differences in a range of child outcomes: higher attachment security (as compared to insecurity) is associated with better social competence (Groh et al., 2014, 2017), emotion understanding (Cooke et al., 2016), quality of peer relationships (Pallini et al., 2014), language competence (Van IJzendoorn, Dijkstra & Bus, 1995),  as  well  as  fewer  internalizing  (Groh  et  al.,  2012,  2017;  Madigan,  Atkinson,  Laurin  &  Benoit,  2013)  and  externalizing behavior problems (Fearon et al., 2010; Groh et al., 2017). Furthermore, attachment security during the first three years of life is related  to  later  brain  development  (Hidalgo  et  al.,  2019;  Leblanc  et  al.,  2017;  Leblanc,  Dégeilh,  Beauchamp  &  Bernier,  2022; Moutsiana et al., 2015).\nWilson-Ali et al., (2019).

    "context_enriched_content": "Why Small Groups and Low Ratios?\nIt is important to distinguish between research studies that focus on infants and toddlers (birth to 36 months) and studies that focus on children older than three years of age. Research findings on the associations between adult-to-child ratios and developmental outcomes have been contradictory with older children. In the preschool years, some studies show that better ratios are associated with improved child outcomes while other studies have found weak or no benefits (Francis & Barnett, 2019; Perlman et al., 2017; Pianta et al. 2005). In contrast, most studies with infants and toddlers find beneficial outcomes for small groups and low ratios (for exceptions see Blau, 2000 and Slot, Leseman, Verhagen & Mulder, 2015). Thus, this body of research emphasizes that the care and education of infants and toddlers should be considered distinct from the preschool years and that small groups and low ratios may be more important during the first three years, especially for infants (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2019; De Schipper, RiksenWalraven & Geurts, 2006). [1]\nOverall, small groups and low ratios are linked with better outcomes for infants and toddlers (Howes, Phillips & Whitebook, 1992). Small groups and lower ratios are associated with warmer and more responsive interactions (Burchinal, Cryer, Clifford & Howes, 2002;  Early  Child  Care  Research  Network,  2006;  Phillipsen,  Burchinal,  Howes  &  Cryer,  1997;  Vandell,  1996).  Sensitive relationships between caregivers and infants is more common in classes with smaller groups (Barros et al., 2016). Research has found that as the ratio of infants to caregivers increases, the quality of care between caregivers and children decreases (Leach et al., 2008;  Rentzou  &  Sakellariou,  2011).  For  example,  with  higher  ratios  of  infants,  caregivers  are  less  able  to  provide  quality interactions that are sensitive and responsive (Pessanha et al., 2017; Thomason & La Paro, 2009). Caregivers show more positive affect and are less restrictive of toddlers' actions when ratios are low (Howes, 1983; Thomason & La Paro, 2009). In programs with a high ratio, toddlers are more likely to show behavior challenges (Kohl et al., 2020). Lastly, low ratios are related to greater infant language abilities. Specifically, small groups with a ratio of one caregiver to three infants had greater language abilities than groups with more than three infants per one caregiver (Burchinal, Roberts, Nabors & Bryant, 1996; Burchinal et al., 2000). When ratios are low, caregivers engage in more conversations and complex play with toddlers (Howes & Rubenstein, 1985). [2]\nPerlmanet al., (2017).

    "context_enriched_content": "Implementing Continuity of Care\nContinuity of care refers to the practice of primary caregivers and children staying together for as long as possible, preferably for the children's first three years (McMullen, 2018). Classrooms, materials and supplies may all change as the children become older, but the one constant is the relationships. Thus, continuity of care is a caregiving practice with relationships at the center, with the goal  of  creating  and  deepening  relationships  between  caregivers  and  children  and  caregivers  and  families.  Continuity  of  care contrasts the common practice of moving infants and toddlers to new classrooms based on their age and/or attainment of skills (Cryer, Hurwitz & Wolery, 2000).\nFigure : Continuity of Care allows deeper relationships to form. ( ) 24.2.1 [1]\nThere are three ways that programs can create continuity of care systems. Programs may choose a system based on space, materials and resources, staff expertise, and parent and community needs: [2]\n1. Group mixed-age infants and toddlers together by having the same primary caregivers work with classes of mixed-age infants and toddlers. The environment should include equipment and materials based on children's ages (the age range depends on the current children), interests, needs, and skills. As children move up into preschool, newly enrolled infants or toddlers are added. The same teachers remain in the classroom. Figure shows an illustration depicting this continuity of care system. In classroom 'A' a primary caregiver has a mixed-age group of both infants and toddlers. When the children are old enough to attend preschool, they then move to a new preschool class, classroom 'B', and new infants and toddlers are enrolled into classroom 'A'. 24.2.1 [2]\nFigure : Continuity of care system #1. ( ) 24.2.1 [1]\n2. Keep children of similar age together with the same teacher. As children grow older, the children and caregivers all move to a more age-appropriate space. In this arrangement, teachers work with different age groups over several years. Figure shows an illustration of this continuity of care system. In classroom 'A' the teacher is with a group of infants. As the infants grow, the teacher  and  children  move  to  a  new  more  age-appropriate  room.  Classroom  'B'  shows  the  same  teacher  and  children  as  in classroom 'A', but now the children are older and they are all in a new classroom together. 24.2.1 [2]\nFigure : Continuity of care system #2. ( ) 24.2.1 [2]\n3.  Another continuity of care system involves children, of similar age, remaining with the same primary caregiver in the same room. As the children grow older, they stay in the same room with their caregivers, but the caregivers adjust the environment and materials as children's abilities and interests change. Figure provides an illustration. In classroom 'A', the caregiver and infants  are  in  an  age-appropriate  room.  As  the  children  grow,  rather  than  change  rooms,  the  classroom  is  adjusted  to  be  ageappropriate for their developing abilities and interests. In this way, the children and caregiver can remain together and stay in the same classroom overtime. 24.2.1 [2]\nFigure : Continuity of care system #3. ( ) 24.2.1 [1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Implementing Continuity of Care\nContinuity  of  care  is  rooted  in  attachment  theory  research  that  supports  the  importance  of  consistent  and  secure  relationships between caregivers and children, especially infants and toddlers. A classic study by Helen Raikes (1993) is strong evidence for the benefits of continuity of care. Raikes found that the longer infants remained with the same primary caregiver, the more likely the children were to develop a secure attachment. Specifically, of the infants who stayed with the same caregiver for over one year, 91% of them had a secure attachment, compared to infants who stayed with the same caregiver for 9 to 12 months (67% had a secure attachment) and 5 to 8 months (50% had a secure attachment). Toddlers in continuity of care classrooms are rated by their caregivers  as  having  fewer  challenging  behaviors  (Ruprecht,  Elicker  &  Choi,  2016).  Having  a  consistent  and  stable  caregiver supports  the  development  of  a  strong  attachment  between  children  and  their  primary  caregivers  (Barnas  &  Cummings,  1994). Infants and toddlers with more caregiver stability scored higher on social skills later in Kindergarten (Bratsch-Hines et al., 2020). Indeed,  both  parents  and  caregivers  report  that  one  of  the  main  benefits  of  continuity  of  care  is  the  increase  in  knowledge caregivers receive of individual children by working with them for a longer period of time (McMullen, Yun, Mihai & Kim, 2016)."

More time together means caregivers and families can potentially develop a deeper understanding of each other with a trusting relationship enriched through experiences over time. Indeed, parents report how continuity of care creates a  caregiver-parent  relationship  of  trust  and  open  communication  (McMullen,  Yun,  Mihai  &  Kim,  2016).  Both  caregivers  and parents reported that their experience with continuity of care created a mutual respect for each other and they both perceived their relationship more as a partnership (McMullen, Yun, Mihai & Kim, 2016).\nFigure : Infants and toddlers in a mixed-age classroom. ( ) 24.2.1 [1]\nNot only are there research supported benefits for implementing continuity of care, there are also research supported concerns for not implementing it. When infants and toddlers are transitioned into a new classroom, they exhibit increased distress and anxiety (Cryer et al., 2005; Field, Vega-Lahr & Jagadish, 1984; O'Farrelly & Hennessy, 2014; Schipper, IJzendoorn & Tavecchio, 2004). Other research emphasizes that transitioning from an infant to a toddler class may be experienced differently for each child and is greatly influenced by caregivers (Recchia, 2012; Recchia & Dvorakova, 2012).\nDespite many organizations promoting the importance of continuity of care, few infant and toddler group care programs actually implement it as a practice (Aguillard, Pierce, Benedict & Burts, 2005; Choi, Horm & Jeon, 2018; Cryer, Hurwitz & Wolery, 2000). Research has revealed that programs accredited by NAEYC (  National Association for the Education of Young Children) were just as  unlikely  to  be  practicing  continuity  of  care  as  group  care  programs  without  an  NAEYC  accreditation  (Aguillard,  Pierce, Benedict  &  Burts,  2005).  In  a  large  national  study  with  Early  Head  Start  infant  and  toddler  programs,  only  29%  of  children experienced two years of continuity of care (Choi, Horm & Jeon, 2018). Thirty-four percent of children experienced changing primary  caregivers  at  least  once  while  37%  of  children  experienced  changing  primary  caregivers  between  two  to  six  times. Caregivers  express  both  benefits  and  challenges  associated  with  implementing  continuity  of  care  (Hegde  &  Cassidy,  2004; Longstreth et al., 2016). Most of the challenges caregivers express about continuity of care can be reduced and/or solved when accurate  information  is  shared  and  with  strategic  planning  (Garrity,  Longstreth  &  Alwashmi,  2016;  Longstreth  et  al.,  2016; McMullen, 2017; Recchia & Dvorakova, 2018).\n- Image by PublicDomainPictures on Pixabay.

    "context_enriched_content": "Defining Routines in Care\nCaregiving routines-arrival and departure, feeding, meals and snacks, diapering and toileting, dressing, and napping-provide a framework for the infant/toddler day. Routine care is far from routine. A significant amount of individualization occurs during routines; they offer caregivers and family child care providers many opportunities to observe and understand each child's ways and preferences and support development and learning across the domains( HHS, ACF, OCC, NITCCI, Infant/Toddler Curriculum and Individualization).[1]\nDuring routine care, infants and toddlers have adults' undivided attention as they focus on meeting children's needs and getting to know  them  (Koralek,  Derry,  Amy  Laura  Dombro,  and  Diane  Trister  Dodge,2005).  Routines  offer  opportunities  to  build relationships with each infant and toddler that promote attachment and trust. These are developmental milestones that are critical for children's sense of security and willingness to explore people and objects in their environments. Routines involve children's bodily  needs,  very  intimate  care,  and  potentially  different  perspectives  from  that  of  the  family,  so  they  should  be  highly individualized; in group care settings, each infant's and toddler's routine care is based on his or her own readiness and timetable for feeding, diapering and toilet learning, and sleep (Zero to Three, 2008). [1]\nHow the routine is carried out and when the routine occurs should be closely coordinated with children's families so that care is consistent between home and the program. Because these routines are so individualized, they should be carried out by the child's primary  caregiver  whenever  possible.  Families  in  home-based  programs  may  individualize  routine  care  for  their  infants  and toddlers according to a combination of children's needs, family schedules, and cultural beliefs and practices. Home visitors can work collaboratively  with  families  to  address  topics  such  as  using  routine  care  times  to  support  their  child's  development  and learning and changing routine care practices as children get older An important part of individualizing routines is using rituals. People often use the terms rituals and routines interchangeably, but they are not the same. According to Gillespie and Petersen, routines are 'repeated, predictable events that provide a foundation for the daily tasks in a child's life . . . Individualizing a routine means  that  the  sequence  is  the  same  but  the  actions  and  timing  may  vary  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  individual children'(Gillespie, Linda, and Peterson, 2012 p. 76). Rituals, in general, are 'special actions that help us navigate emotionally important  events  or  transitions  in  our  lives  as  well  as  enhance  aspects  of  our  daily  routines  to  deepen  our  connections  and relationships' (Gillespie, Linda, and Peterson, 2012 p. 76). For infants and toddlers, a ritual is 'a special practice that helps a child accept aspects of a routine, even an individualized routine, that are stressful' (Gillespie, Linda, and Peterson, 2012 p. 76). Rituals that  adults  develop  with  children  and  use  at  home  or  in  group  care  can  ease  emotionally  loaded  situations  such  as  separations (including going to sleep), feeding and meal times, and learning to use the toilet.[1]\nCoordinating routine care between home and program may sometimes be challenging. Caregivers attitudes and beliefs about how routines should be carried out may differ from what families believe and do.\n[1] Early Head Start National Resource Center. (2014).

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Schedules\nMany states require child care programs to have written daily schedules. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) encourages practices in which 'the curriculum guides the development of a daily schedule that is predictable yet flexible and responsive to individual needs of the children' (NAEYC, 2015, p. 9). How do you develop a daily schedule for a group of infants and toddlers who are each on their own timetable? This is an important question because infants and toddlers have not yet developed the ability to manage their own feelings and behavior. For infant and toddler care caregivers, creating a daily schedule that is based on responsive care routines makes good sense. Early learning researchers widely agree that adults can best support early learning when a child's interests are central to the learning experience (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000).[1]\nFigure : Afternoon schedule of Rest Time/ Quiet Activities in the reading/Art/Sensory area. Handwashing/Diapers Checked in the bathroom. Snack and Indoor exploration in the Block play/Sensory experiences/Art/Music and Movement/Science/math/Literacy/Manipulatives.  Group  Time/  Music  and  Movement  and  then  Outdoor  Exploration  with bikes/art/sensory experiences/gross motor/balls/gardening.  ([1]) 25.3.1\nThe daily schedule orders the events that take place each day. It outlines how the daily events are expected to flow, the order in which they happen, and for how long (although not necessarily the exact times).\nSchedules are important because they :\n- provide consistency and predictability, which help infants and toddlers develop a sense of trust and security;\n- give caregivers, family child care providers, and home visitors a framework for planning and making good use of time spent with children; and\n- provide a link between home and school, and reassure families, especially those whose children are in group care, about what their children are doing during the day. [1]\nAs  you  incorporate  the  unique  care  routines  and  rhythms  of  each  infant  and  toddler  in  your  care,  you  can  begin  to  create individualized daily schedules, which is an important basis of high-quality caregiving (Raikes & Edwards, 2009). Keep in mind, to respond to changing individual needs of infants, it's important to allow room for flexibility during the day. Anything too rigid will create undue stress for babies and tension for the caregivers who try to adhere to a set plan. For example, very young infants, who are on their own sleep schedules, may sleep through outside time and be ready to play and engage while the older infants nap. This does not mean there is no order or system; you are still making sure that all the daily care routines are happening. However, if one infant needs to eat or sleep sooner than others, you can adapt. Maybe a 2-year-old with a new baby brother at home needs a little more cuddle time than he did last week. Or an infant needs breathing treatments at certain times in the day and you have adjusted the schedule to read books to him and other toddlers during his therapy.[1]\nWhile consistency and predictability  are  important  characteristics  of  schedules,  flexibility  is  just  as  important.  This  means  that schedules  can  be  modified  in  the  moment  to  meet  individual  children's  needs  or  group  needs,  take  advantage  of  'teachable moments,' and maintain a consistent and an unhurried pace. Schedules can also be modified in the long term as children's needs and abilities change over time. [1]\nW, 1 = BM. W, 2 = DB.

([1]) 25.3.1\nOther characteristics of schedules, in particular for group care settings, include:\n- major events occurring in the same order every day;\n- sufficient time for routine care and transitions from one event to the next;\n- balance between active and quiet times;\n- opportunities to be alone, with a familiar adult, and with small groups of children; and\n- opportunities to spend time outdoors."

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Schedules\nInfants  follow  individualized  schedules  for  sleeping,  eating,  diapering,  and  playing.  A  one-size-fits-all  schedule  would  not  be appropriate for them. This means that caregivers and family child care providers will likely have as many schedules as they have infants. For example, at any given time, one infant may be napping, another getting her bottle, and a third playing with a soft block on  the  floor.23  Families  are  primary  sources  of  information  about  when  their  children  eat,  nap,  are  most  active,  and  so  on;  in culturally consistent care, the timing of these caregiving routines and awake times for play in a group care setting should match as closely  as  possible  to  when  they  occur  at  home.  Cultural  continuity,  particularly  for  young  children,  allows  for  uninterrupted development of children's self-identity. Managing these individual schedules requires some planning. Knowledge about individual children can help staff predict when each child may get tired, get hungry, or need a diaper change; in turn, staff can take steps to prepare, such as get diapering supplies or cots out in advance or coordinate care responsibilities with another adult. [2]\nSchedules for toddlers in group care may be more consistent and group oriented. For example, toddlers may eat meals together, go outside together, take naps at the same time, and come together for short times in small groups for stories, music, and movement experiences. Caregivers and family child care providers may create simple visual schedules with photos or drawings that show the daily events and when they occur to help children understand what happens and when. However, toddlers, still have individual timetables for routine care as well as times when they need to be away from the group or one-on-one with a familiar, trusted adult. Honoring toddlers' individual schedules and home culture is as important as honoring infants' schedules and home culture. Family input continues to play a central role.[2]\nOne important aspect of the daily schedule is transitions. Infants and toddlers experience many transitions (changes) during the day, for example, between routines and experiences, arrivals and departures, and going outside to play and coming back in. Home visits include transitions,  too!  Each  child  experiences  and  handles  transitions  differently;  change  is  harder  for  some  children  than  for others, so transitions can be some of the most challenging times of the day. Infants and toddlers rely on adults to provide a sense of safety and continuity as they experience change; individualizing transitions is one way to provide the stability infants and toddlers need.\n[1] Image by Amanda Taintor is licensed CC BY-NC\n[1] Early Head Start National Resource Center.(n.d) [Individualizing care for infants and tollders].

    "context_enriched_content": "Provide Opportunities and Interactions to Foster Physical, Social, and Emotional Growth\nYou can support development in all areas during everyday interactions and activities. Consider an infant's diaper change. During this routine care you can support her social and emotional development by giving one-on-one attention that includes eye contact, smiling, talking about what is happening in the moment, and pointing out things that are familiar to the child (for example, 'Oh! I see you're wearing your Bear diaper this morning. You like it when your mama gets the Bear diapers for you, don't you?'). In this simple exchange, the caregiver is not only supporting the child's social and emotional development but language and cognitive development as well (EHS NRC, 2014; Harms et al., 1998; NAEYC, 2015).[1]"

Self-directed play gives children opportunities to practice what they have observed and learned about their world, test new ideas, and build skills in all areas of development. When children come together to play, it should be driven by their desire to be together, even if it means being near each other and doing separate things. Caregiver-initiated, whole-group experiences such as song time, dancing, or reading books can work well for older toddlers if they can choose whether or not to participate. Group gatherings should be limited in time, flexible, and account for the individual interests of all children. For example, in a family child care home with several toddlers, many of them like to be near the caregiver while she sings. One child goes to the book corner when this happens and she peeks over the shelves at the group. The child's mother has said that, at home, her little girl sings all of the songs, but in child care, she does not actually join the group until several months later, when she is ready (Harms et al., 1998; NAEYC, 2015).[1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Inclusive Caregiving\nWhen caregivers think about inclusive caregiving, many people assume children with known or diagnosed special needs. Inclusive caregiving  is  for  all  children  that  have  different  abilities  or  privileges.  Developmental  delays  can  happen  from  genetic abnormalities, birth trauma, accidents, or several known or unknown reasons. The most important aspect of inclusive caregiving is remembering the human behind needs. Inclusion means that a child with sensory challenges, even if it is not yet diagnosed, should be given the effort and time to make their environment the best and most conducive. For example, as a caregiver, you notice that one of your children does not want to go to the sensory table, does not like to finger paint and shies away from any messy play. Although interested, something is stopping them from engaging. What can a caregiver do for a child like this to allow them to have access to all aspects of the classroom? Meet them where they are at! Try putting the playdough in a plastic bag for the child to explore. Put paint in a plastic bag! Use gardening gloves in messy play. This is one example of inclusivity.

    "context_enriched_content": "Overview of Inclusive Care\nChildren with disabilities or other special needs refer to children with a specific diagnosis and children who do not have a diagnosis but whose behavior, development, or health affect their family's ability to maintain child care services. The disability or special need may be as mild as a slight speech delay or as complex as a mixed diagnosis of motor challenges, vision impairment, and cognitive delays.[1]  Special  health  care  needs  include  a  variety  of  conditions  such  as  birth  defects,  neurological  disorders,  and chronic illnesses that can be life-threatening or impact daily living (e.g., cancer, sickle cell disease [or anemia], cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, AIDS, diabetes, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).[1] [2]\nFamilies of children with disabilities or other special needs have the same need for childcare as other families. However, families of children with disabilities or special needs often find the search for quality and affordable child care a more significant challenge as they face the reluctance of many child care providers to enroll their children. This situation makes it all the more important that child  care  providers  strive  to  include  all  children  in  their  programs  not  to  increase  the  immense  challenges  that  such  families already face.[3]\nOnly about 10 percent of eligible infants and toddlers with developmental delays nationwide receive early intervention services, which  are  widely  agreed  to  reduce  delays  and  lessen  the  adverse  effects  of  risk  factors  and  disabilities  on  learning  and development. California serves fewer children than the national average. Challenges arise from spotty screening, tenuous linkages to  referral  and  evaluation, and the intricacies of crossing multiple agencies-sometimes without the knowledge of English-for families. [4]\nFollowing the Individuals with Disabilities  Education  Act  (IDEA),  children  ages  3-21  are  entitled  to  a  free,  appropriate  public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE). LRE requires that, to the extent possible, children with disabilities should have access to the general education curriculum, along with learning activities and settings available to their peers without disabilities. Corresponding federal legislation applied to infants and toddlers (children birth to 3) and their families specifies that early intervention services and supports must be provided in \"natural environments,\" generally interpreted to mean a broad range of contexts and activities that generally occur for typically developing infants and toddlers in homes and communities.[5] [6]\nChildren with disabilities or other special needs and their families must be included in quality early childhood education programs that are the natural environments of their typically developing peers. Children learn from their interactions with other children and their surroundings while creating a sense of security and self-esteem from caring relationships with program providers and staff. Everyone benefits from quality early childhood education programs that provide inclusive care. Children who have a disability or special need get to know and interact with typically developing peers, while their families benefit from programs and services they need to achieve their parenting goals. Children who are typically developing benefit when they have the opportunity to get to know peers who are atypically developing in the classroom. Everyone has the opportunity to learn about other human beings regarding their strengths and challenges.\nFigure : Children of all abilities should be included in high-quality ECE classrooms . ( [1] ) 26.2.1\nChildren and families want to be accepted and included in their community regardless of ability. They want to belong. But the kind of  belonging  they  desire  goes  beyond  simply  \"being  together.\"  They  want  full,  unconditional  membership  in  family  and community. As Norman Kunc, a disability rights advocate, said so eloquently, \"When inclusive education is fully embraced, we abandon the idea that children have to become 'normal' to contribute to the world. Instead, we search for and nourish the inherent\ngifts in all people. We begin to look beyond typical ways of becoming valued members of the community and, in doing so, begin to realize the achievable goal of providing all children with an authentic sense of belonging.\"[6]\nChildren with disabilities or other special needs may present unique challenges, but the care they need is very similar to any child. Children with special needs spend most of their time doing what other children do. They have the same curiosity, desire to play, and  need  to  communicate  as  their  peers  do.  Childcare  providers  providing  developmentally  appropriate  childcare,  which  is individualized to meet the needs of every child, already have many of the skills needed to serve children with disabilities or other special needs.[7]"

Children who learn differently or have language delays commonly manifest special needs  through  their  behavior  in  group  settings.  Early  childhood  educators  can  provide  a  language  -rich  environment  and  make accommodations based on the knowledge of the individual child.[1]\nThere  are  fewer  children  with  more  significant  disabilities  such  as  intellectual  disabilities  (formerly  referred  to  as  mental retardation), physical and mobility impairments, or multiple disabilities. Children with significant disabilities are likely to receive specialized services that may support success in a childcare setting. Children eligible for and who receive early intervention or special education services have individual plans with goals and strategies for caregivers and providers to use. For children under age  three,  the  plans  are  called  individualized  family  services  plans  (IFSPs);  for  children  over  age  three,  the  plans  are  called individualized education programs (IEPs). When these plans are developed, early childhood educators can be essential members of an IFSP or IEP team.[1]\n[1] Chapter 15: Families of Children with Special Needs or Special Health Care Needs by Krischa Esquivel; Emily Elam; Jennifer\nParis; and Maricela Tafoya CC BY\nThis page titled 26.3: What Programs Can Do To Be Inclusive of All Children is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Emily Elam."

    "context_enriched_content": "Each Child is Unique\nInformation about a specific disability may give an early childhood educator ideas for how to support a child. However, when serving an individual child, the provider should focus on the child's needs, not the disability or its label. A child with cerebral palsy, for example, may walk with leg braces, use a wheelchair, have minor physical symptoms, or demonstrate a delay in using language. The  possible  variations  within  this  one  label  are  tremendous,  indicating  that  no  single  label  or  diagnosis  can  provide  enough information about a particular child. Early childhood educators need to learn beyond a textbook definition and ask questions with sensitivity and understanding-particularly in talks with parents.\nEarly childhood educators can go forward setting a tone of welcome and understanding. When a family member shares a child's diagnosis, a good follow-  up question is often \"And how does that affect ____________'s development?\" This approach can help assure a family member that the child care provider is sincerely concerned about the child's success and is interested in providing appropriate,  individually  tailored  care.  The  response  from  the  parent  will  help  the  child  care  provider  determine  what accommodations might be needed, what other questions may be appropriate to ask, and whether specialists are involved or needed.\n[1]\n[1] Chapter 15: Families of Children with Special Needs or Special Health Care Needs by Krischa Esquivel; Emily Elam; Jennifer Paris; and Maricela Tafoya CC BY\nThis page titled 26.4: Learning about Individual Children  is  shared  under  a  mixed 4.0 license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or  curated  by Amanda Taintor & Emily Elam."

    "context_enriched_content": "Inclusion in the Classroom\nInclusion embodies the values, policies, and practices that support the right of every child and their family, regardless of ability, to participate in a broad range of activities and contexts as full members of families, communities, and society. The desired results of inclusive experiences for children with and without disabilities and their families include a sense of belonging and membership, positive social relationships and friendships, and development and learning to reach their full potential. The defining features of inclusion that can be used to identify high-quality early childhood programs and services are:[1]\n- Access - providing access to a wide range of learning opportunities, activities, settings, and environments\n- Participation - even if environments and programs are designed to facilitate access, some children will need additional individualized accommodations and support to participate fully in play and learning activities with peers and adults.\n- Supports - an infrastructure of systems-level supports must be afforded to those providing inclusive services to children and families. [13]\nEven if children with disabilities are not currently enrolled in an early childhood education program, educators can still promote inclusive practices. One way is to have pictures, books, and materials that present children with disabilities in a general setting. How people are alike and different naturally arises in an early childhood education setting; a caregiver can take advantage of these opportunities to discuss them. Language use is also critical in developing an atmosphere of inclusion. The best practice is to use \"person-  first\" language when one is talking about people with disabilities. This practice simply means putting the person before the disability: \"a child with autism spectrum disorder\" rather than \"an autistic child.\"[2]\nExploring inclusion with families, colleagues, and children will suggest other ways to expand inclusive practices. For example, planning staff discussions on specific changes in philosophy, attitudes, and practices goes far toward including children with special needs  in  a  childcare  setting.  Outside  the  immediate  early  childhood  education  program  setting,  adults  with  disabilities  in  a community might contribute to a care provider's expanding knowledge of issues related specifically to inclusion and to disabilities in general.[2]\n[1] Introducing developmental disability through a disability studies perspecitve by Emily Brooks and Mariette Bates.

    "context_enriched_content": "Making Inclusion Work\nAs each child is  unique,  so  is  each  early  childhood  education  program.  There  is  no  magic  formula  for  making  inclusion  work beyond  the  creativity,  energy,  and  interest  that  most  early  childhood  educators  already  bring  to  their  work.  Their  uniqueness notwithstanding, every program can include children with disabilities successfully. And each makes it work child by child, day by day. A \"can-do\" attitude among the teachers helps to provide the necessary energy for coming up with solutions to the inevitable challenges.  It  also  helps  to  have  an  enthusiastic  attitude  toward  making  inclusion  work  rather  than  simply  fulfilling  a  legal obligation.[1]\nSome children need small changes to the curriculum or minor support to get the most out of certain activities. These sorts of things may consist of fairly simple accommodations, such as providing a special place or quiet activity for a child who cannot participate in large-group activities or making available a special snack for a child who needs to eat more frequently than the typical meal or snack schedule.[1]\nFigure : Individual children's needs will help you decide what adaptations you need to make . ( [2] ) 26.6.1\nOther children may require more specific adaptations that might not be readily apparent. A variety of community resources can help determine what those might be. The family, for example, is always the first and most important guide for what a child might need; after that, an area specialist or a local workshop might be. Beyond the immediate community, a world of literature in books, periodicals,  and  Websites  devoted  to  disabilities  and  inclusion  can  inform  an  early  childhood  educator  about  appropriate adaptations for a child with a particular condition or need.[1]\nPrograms  that  begin  with  a  high-quality,  developmentally  appropriate  foundation;  a  positive  attitude  on  the  part  of  the  care provider; appropriate adult-child ratios; supportive administrators; and adequate training for the provider will be in a good position to creatively solve problems for a child with disabilities or other special needs, exactly as it does for children who are typically developing. If a child already has an established diagnosis, trained intervention personnel may be available to assist in this process. One of the biggest roles of a care provider is to  facilitate  a  sense  of  belonging  and  inclusion.  Several  helpful  strategies  are  as follows:\n- Start with the assumption that all children are competent.\n- Adapt the environment so that it is developmentally appropriate, challenging, and fits the needs and interests of each child.\n- While there may be a need to support a child's mastery of a specific skill, keep the whole child in mind, particularly the child's social-emotional experience.[1]\nConsider the following questions when adapting an activity for a child with special needs:\n- Does the child have an opportunity to be in control of the learning experience?\n- Is there a balance between adult-initiated learning and child-initiated learning?\n- Can the child make choices while learning the skill?\n- Is the child able to initiate their own efforts to practice the skill, with support given by the child care provider?\n- Is the child gaining self-confidence and showing the joy of accomplishment while learning?\n- Is there room in the activity for the child to make discoveries?\n[1] Chapter 15: Families of Children with Special Needs or Special Health Care Needs by Krischa Esquivel; Emily Elam; Jennifer Paris; and Maricela Tafoya CC BY\n[2] Inclusion Works!

    "context_enriched_content": "Materials and Inclusion\nChoosing toys and materials carefully is essential, because the right toys and materials can give children with disabilities a chance to be engaged and to experience success. For infants and toddlers, child care providers typically offer a variety of toys, such as blocks,  stacking  or  nesting  cups,  and  simple  shape  sorters  or  puzzles  designed  for  very  young  children  to  use.  Also,  including materials  that  encourage  sensory  exploration  by  using  smells,  sounds,  sights,  and  textures  enhances  children's  learning  and development.[1]\nDepending on the individual needs, some toys or materials might require simple adaptations to support the child's ability to use them. For example, attaching hook-and-loop fasteners (Velcro), large knobs, or handles may make it easier for a child with visual or physical-motor special needs to play with blocks or puzzles. Similarly, adding fabric or tabs to the edges of cardboard book pages  can  make  it  easier  to  turn  pages.  Of  course,  it's  essential  to  be  mindful  of  potential  choking  hazards  when  considering modifying materials.[1]\nThese are just a few simple and inexpensive strategies to ensure that all children can use materials successfully. Fortunately, family members and specialists familiar with an individual child's development are also a great source of information and ideas for making simple adaptations to support the child's success. Many toys and materials for infants and toddlers already have some of the simple adaptations mentioned above.[1]\nAssistive technology can support a child's ability to participate actively in his or her home, childcare program, school, or other community settings. Using electronic toys, switches, or other devices in your child care environment may help an infant or toddler to  take  part  fully  in  activities.  Switches  allow  children  who  have  limited  hand  function  or  muscle  control  to  operate  toys  or materials that they could not play with otherwise. Sometimes a very young child will need equipment for positioning, such as a specialized chair or stander. Assistive technology and adaptations should be listed in the Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) if a child has one.[1]\nThinking about how a child with special needs will explore and use your child care environment gives you a chance to consider the strengths of your environment and enhance it as needed.[1]\n[1]  U.S  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Administration  for  Children  and  Families,  n.d.,  Creating  Inclusive Environments and Learning Experiences for Infants and Toddlers is in the pubic domain\nThis page titled 26.7: How to Make Adaptions to Materials to Meet the Needs of an Infant or Toddler is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor & Emily Elam."

When the expertise of many are combined, ideas develop and strategies emerge better than those any one person could have developed alone. The result is the essence of true collaboration.[2]\nFor collaboration to be successful, the following elements are essential:\n- Respect for the family's knowledge and experience with the child. They are the first and best resource and should be included in planning and implementing care of their child.\n- Clear and regular communication, both informal or planned meetings.\n- Time is reserved for collaboration, recognizing that everyone is likely to be pressed for time.\n- Everyone has an investment and active involvement.\n- Collaborative efforts to provide the appropriate assessments and support services for the child.\nMore  information  about  identifying  children  with  special  needs  and  providing  inclusive  care  can  be  found  in  the  publication inclusion Works by the California Department of Education.[2]\nFigure : All children need to be able to participate in the early childhood education environment fully .

Typically, developing children can progress from simple to more complex types of play without special teacher support. However, children with disabilities may experience restrictions in attending and in being engaged in activities requiring more complex levels of social play (Sigafoos et al., 1999). They may need adequate support from their environments to spend more time engaged in more complex social interactions with their peers. Literature shows that the social development of children with disabilities and their  later  social  success  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  early  interventions  targeting  social  play  between  children  with disabilities  and their typically developing peers (Ivory and McCollum, 1999; Craig-Unkefer and Kaiser, 2002;  Guralnick  et  al., 2006). As key elements of children's social environments, both peers and teachers can actively facilitate participation in all types of social play. In fact, beside children's characteristics, a diversity of environmental factors which can affect children's social play are highlighted in the literature, namely classroom characteristics (e.g., toys characteristics, the existence of learning/activity centers), and the types of teacher interactions (Ivory and McCollum, 1999; Guralnick et al., 2006).[1]\n[1] Coelho V and Pinto AI (2018) The Relationship between Children's Developmental Functioning and Participation in Social Activities in Portuguese Inclusive Preschool Settings.

    "context_enriched_content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder -ASD\nDuring the last two decades, research has made tremendous progress with regard to early identification and diagnosis of ASD. As a result, in many cases, ASD can now be reliably diagnosed between 18 and 24 months of age (Ozonoff S, Young GS, Landa RJ, Brian J, Bryson S, Charman T, et al, 2015). Advances in best practices related to early identification are reflected in a 2006 policy statement published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2006), asserting that Primary Care Providers (e.g., family physicians, pediatricians) administer formal screening tests during every well-child visit scheduled at 18 and 24 months, independent of known risk factors or reported concerns. Moreover, Primary Care Providers are urged to promptly refer children for Early Intervention services as soon as ASD is seriously considered as a possibility for diagnosis.\nAmong the  children  with  a  documented  clinical  ASD  diagnosis,  children's  median  age  at  first  diagnosis  was  51  months.  The median age of children's first comprehensive developmental evaluation was 40 months, with 44% being first evaluated at or prior to 36 months, and 37% being first evaluated later than 48 months.\nThe intersection between (1) the complex ECE system in the US, and (2) characteristic delays in ASD diagnoses has important implications for children's access to inclusive ECE environments. On one hand, many children who are eventually diagnosed with ASD are enrolled in ECE programs prior to receiving a formal diagnosis. Thus, ECE teachers serve as an important source of social and  professional  support  during  a  time  when  parents  begin  to  recognize  concerns  about  their  child's  social-communication development,  navigate  the  diagnostic  process,  and  begin  to  access  ASD-specific  resources.  ECE  teachers  begin  to  implement individualized  instruction  and  classroom  adaptations  prior  to  children's  ASD  diagnoses  in  many  instances.  On  the  other  hand, because most children with ASD do not receive their formal ASD diagnosis until they are 4 years of age or older, the Pre-K and kindergarten  years  are  often  the  first  realistic  opportunity  for  implementing  formal  special  education  services  in  inclusive classroom settings.[1]\n[1] Siller M, Morgan L, Wedderburn Q, Fuhrmeister S and Rudrabhatla A (2021) Inclusive Early Childhood Education for Children With and Without Autism: Progress, Barriers, and Future Directions.

What qualities of those places make you feel welcome or secure? What makes you want to go back? Thinking about these places, you might remember the people around you, the room's color, the presence of sunlight, sounds and smells, furniture, accessories, or temperature.\nNow consider places you don't like to spend time. Maybe the dentist's office, the airport or a noisy restaurant. What makes these environments less pleasant for you? In some settings, we feel relaxed and comfortable. In others, we feel tense, overwhelmed, and confused. The environment has a powerful effect on us. It influences how we feel, what we do, and the ways we respond. Some of us dislike places where we feel we cannot control or predict our experiences. In some spaces, we may feel we don't belong or are not appreciated.\nJust like adults, infants and toddlers are affected by their environments, even if they cannot tell us directly how they feel. It is our job as caregivers to ensure learning spaces make infants and toddlers feel welcome, secure, and ready to learn. (The Ohio State University for the US Department of Defense's Office of Family Policy/Children and Youth, 2021)\nA childcare environment is one of the child's most valuable teachers and impacts every facet of a program. Research conducted with the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS) (Sylva et al. 2010) and the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS)  (Howes  et  al.  2008;  Mashburn  et  al.  2008)  indicates  physical  environment,  social-emotional  climate,  and  social interactions all influence a program's overall quality: high-quality physical environments enhance young children's well-being and development. All environments communicate messages. In childcare programs, these messages may convey caregivers' beliefs and values about young children, how children learn, the role of families, and the importance of community. A program's environment should convey to all children that they belong and are safe. [1]\n[1] California Department of Education. (2019).

    "context_enriched_content": "What to Include\nThere is substantial agreement internationally about what is essential in providing for children's developmental needs in centerbased childcare (e.g., Lamb and Ahnert 2006). Universally recognized core elements required for children's positive development are:  safe  and  healthy  care  settings,  developmentally  appropriate  stimulation  and  opportunities  for  learning,  positive  interactions with adults, and the promotion of individual emotional growth and positive relationships with other children (Cryer et al. 2002) (Verner et.al, 2016). Spaces for infants and toddlers can be organized to support a variety of exploration and routines. Most often, the arrangement of play spaces supports different types of learning and experiences, such as: (Lally, Stewart, and Greenwald 2009)\n- Small-muscle activity\n- Sensory perception\n- Large-motor activity\n- Creative expression\nAdditionally, caregivers need space for infant and toddler routines: greetings, departures, eating and feeding, sleeping, diapering, and toileting.\nOther areas of exploration to consider when creating an environment include block play, fantasy play, multilevel areas, quiet areas to explore books, and cozy areas (WestEd, n.d.). Dividing the room into areas creates an organized and meaningful environment.\nFigure : Infant Environment (Image by Community Playthings is used with permission) 27.3.1\nImage by Community Playthings is used with permission\nNot only do the types of experiences an environment supports need consideration, but the infant and toddler environment should also:[1]\n- Ensure safety\n- Promote health\n- Provide comfort for children and adults\n- Be convenient for children and adults\n- Be child-sized\n- Maximize flexibility\n- Encourage movement\n- Allow for choice\n- Ensure accessibility\nThese concepts help programs focus on the overall impact of the entire environment on infants, toddlers, and the adults who care for them.[2]\n- [1]  California  Department  of  Education  (CDE  Press).

    "context_enriched_content": "Safety\nCreating  spaces  for  infants  and  toddlers  that  ensure  safety  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations  when  designing  an environment. Safe settings enable infants' and toddlers' freedom of exploration and support their developing sense of self. For health and safety reasons, it is essential that eating, food preparation, sleeping, and diapering areas are separate from play areas.\nFigure : Toileting and Kitchen area should be separate for health and safety ([1] 27.4.1\nSafe environments allow a caregiver to spend less time monitoring infants' and toddlers' safety and frees them up to spend more time on interactions and building relationships. When the environment constantly causes a caregiver to move the infant to a safer location,  the  child's  learning  and  engagement  are  interrupted.  Instead,  set  the  environment  to  allow  freedom  of  movement  and engagement without excessive restrictions.\nFigure : Two infant environments with well-defined areas and freedom of choice for infants. ([2]) 27.4.1\nAs infants and toddlers move around and explore their environment, they will move toys from place to place. As a result, the floor is often strewn with toys. Be mindful that, when toys are scattered, infants' investigation might be interrupted, stopped, or create a potential hazard. Caregivers should periodically pass through the environment, remove items not being engaged with, and return them to designated storage areas. This practice maintains a safe and inviting play space and keeps toys accessible to the infants.[3] With older infants and toddlers, building in time for children to help with cleanup before transitioning to another activity supports responsible caretaking of their environment.\nKeeping the environment safe and in adherence to specific licensing regulations and restrictions can be difficult, if not impossible, to keep in memory. Checklists allow regular safety assessments of indoor and outdoor environments. This documentation helps caregivers keep track of these details and maintain a safe environment.[4]\nFigure : Health and Safety Screener ([4] 27.4.1\nAn easy way to create a safe environment and foster relationship building is to meet appropriate group size and child-to-adult ratio limits (Gonzalez-Mena, & Widmeyer Eyer, 2012). Smaller group sizes and lower child-to-adult ratios create and maintain a safe environment for all infants and toddlers.[5] As a baseline, California has licensing requirements to ensure the safety of children in early childhood programs. In California, community care licensing states that infant centers serving children from birth to age 2 need to have a minimum ratio of 1 fully qualified infant teacher to 4 infants. In a room with more than 4 infants, up to a maximum of 12 infants, there must be 1 fully qualified teacher responsible for the direct care and supervision of a maximum of 4 infants. If a fully qualified teacher supervises aides, each aide can be accountable for the direct care and supervision of a maximum of 4 infants. ( Teacher-to-Child Ratios in Child Care Centers 2016) Many programs go beyond minimum state requirements to ensure children's safety and prevent accidents and injuries.[6]\nFigure :  Licensing  Ratio  Toddler  Component [1] 27.4.1\nThe Program for Infant Toddler Care recommends ratios of 1 adult to 3 or 4 children and a total group size of 6 to 12 children, depending on their ages. The guiding principle is the younger the child, the smaller the group ( Small Groups in Center-Based Programs n.d.).  A  helpful  resource  for  research-based  recommendations  for  group  size  and  ratios  is  Caring  for  Our  Children FOURTH EDITION National Health and Safety Performance Standards Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs by the National  Resource  Center  for  Health  and  Safety  in  Child  Care  and  Early  Education,  and  the  Head  Start  Program  Performance Standards.[5]\nFigure : PITC Reccomended Ratio.

(The Ohio State University for the US Department of Defense's Office of Family Policy/Children and Youth, 2021) When caregivers can sit comfortably on the floor, attention is spent engaging in responsive interactions with infants and toddlers rather than finding a comfortable position.[3]\nFigure : Creating a comfortable space ([4]) 27.6.1\nA comfortable environment where adults and children can relax encourages teachers to sit with infants and creates an atmosphere conveying emotional and physical safety to all. Offer places for children and adults to snuggle, like a glider or rocking chair or couch, where adults can hold children in their laps for comforting and quiet interactions.[1]\nFigure : Caregiver finds a comfortable place to read with toddlers on the ground.

It empowers children to try out ideas and use new materials. When organizing for easy use, think about storing similar materials together. Similar materials are things that go together or are necessary for certain activities. For example, baby dolls could be stored near blankets or other dramatic play items like play dishes and spoons.

    "context_enriched_content": "Movement And Choice\nLike adults, infants and toddlers become frustrated when they cannot easily move through an environment or find what they need. Infants and toddlers learn about and experience life through sensory and motor explorations. They touch, taste, smell, observe, and move  in  the  world  around  them  to  make  meaning  and  build  concepts.  The  floors,  ceiling,  lighting,  walls,  and  furniture  all contribute to the learning of infants and toddlers. To fully benefit from the environment, infants and toddlers require safe freedom of uninhibited movement as much as possible throughout the day. Freedom of movement supports children's growth by allowing space for practicing physical skills as they need and want. (Lally, Stewart, & Greenwald, 2009). [1]\nAn  environment  allowing  infants  and  toddlers  to  move  around  freely  helps  them  fully  explore  the  space  and  do  what  comes naturally,  including  crawling,  scooting,  running,  climbing,  jumping,  and  walking.  Caregivers  should  avoid  placing  infants  in restrictive  devices,  such  as  swings,  bouncy  seats,  or  highchairs  for  extended  periods  (or  at  all  if  possible).  Restrictive  devices inhibit natural movement and prevent children from using their muscles to roll, scoot, and pull themselves up.\nFigure : Restrictive devices are not recommended for use in group care ([2]) 27.9.1\nClear  pathways  for  infants  and  toddlers  allow  them  to  move  easily  through  the  room  while  also  creating  a  defined  space  for protected exploration. The furnishings and equipment should allow a variety of movement choices so infants can crawl through, pull up on and, as they develop physical skills, climb on and jump off.[3]\nFigure : Large foam blocks provide various movement opportunities. ([4]) 27.9.2\nSoft, thick floor coverings, such as vinyl mats, help mobile infants feel comfortable moving on the floor.\nFigure : Large plastic mats provide additional comfort for infants moving on the floor. 27.9.3\n27.9.4\nFigure\n: Soft mats on the floor create more comfort for mobile and non-mobile infants. [5]\nAdding unique and exciting features such as tunnels encourages further motor skills and exploration development.\nFigure : Add tunnels for more movement opportunities. ([7]) 27.9.6\nFigure :  A  tunnel  with  plastic  balls  adds  fun  and  playful experiences. [6] 27.9.5\nFor  toddlers,  slopes,  stairs,  or  small  ladders  allow  the  opportunity  for  safe  vertical  movement.  Offering  infants  and  toddlers  a variety of choices throughout the day helps them stay safely interested and engaged.[8]\nFigure :  Stairs  and  slides  create  additional  movement choices. [9] 27.9.8\nFigure : Provide ramps for additional movement opportunities.[4] 27.9.7\nA positive environment allows children to move freely without hearing \"no\" as they explore, make choices and interact with their surroundings.[10] Young children can follow their interests and develop their abilities within an environment that is respectful and encouraging of them.[1] When children feel supported and engaged in an 'environment of yes', they are less likely to exhibit behaviors that are challenging to adults.[11]\nFor infants and toddlers, every aspect of the world is exciting and engaging. Environments should support them in discovering that they can find and use materials independently. When infants and toddlers spend their days in a well-organized environment with clear choices, they find fascinating materials and can concentrate their efforts on exploring and learning. Storing materials on low, open  shelves  lets  children  see  the  materials  available,  make  a  choice,  and  return  the  item  with  less  adult  support.  As  soon  as children can creep or crawl to materials, they should be encouraged to select and access the materials they are interested in playing with on their own. (The Ohio State University for the US Department of Defense's Office of Family Policy/Children and Youth, 2021)  A  disorganized  or  overstimulating  environment  creates  difficulty  for  infants  and  toddlers  to  focus  on  a  particular environmental aspect. Too many options can be overwhelming."

It is also essential to consider ways to provide appropriate risk-taking opportunities as young children seek out challenges as they grow and learn.[1]\nFigure : Consider adding a low bench outside for additional movement opportunities. ([4]) 27.9.9\nWhen children learn to use signs and symbols in their environment it promotes independence. Caregivers support independence by carefully labeling objects and the places where things belong. The best labels use written words plus pictures or parts of the object (like a puzzle piece on a shelf that contains wooden puzzles). Labeling not only helps children learn to access toys and eventually clean up independently, but it also creates a print-rich environment. Caregivers discover they give fewer directions and reminders when  appropriate  labels  are  used.  When  children  can  engage  independently  with  materials,  caregivers  have  more  time  for interacting and expanding learning opportunities.\nFigure : Use labels [4] 27.9.10\nFigure :  Label  shelves  with  both  words  and pictures.[4] 27.9.11\n- [1] California Department of Education.

A provocation is a picture, experience, or item that provokes thought, interest, questions, or creativity (Edwards, 2002). Provocations can help 'provoke' young children to use, think about or see materials in new ways. A good classroom design provides options to incorporate provocations easily.

It is crucial for teachers and program leaders to consciously consider the cultural context of their environments and the cultural messages their program sends. Staff and families can work collaboratively to create familiar settings and experiences for the children.\nPrograms can create a climate of respect for each child's culture and language through authentic, meaningful connections to the young  children's  experiences  in  their  homes  and  communities.  Environment  design  is  a  critical  piece  of  this  objective.  These genuine  connections  enhance  learning  and  a  sense  of  belonging,  especially  for  culturally  diverse  children.  All  aspects  of  the program,  including  the  environment,  must  reflect  or  represent  the  families'  cultures,  customs,  and  languages  (including  the teachers, other staff, and volunteers).\nSome ways to create an inclusive environment include (but are not limited to):\n- Displaying family artifacts and pictures of the family members' unique talents (for example, musical or artistic) prominently throughout the environment\n- Incorporating environmental print that reflects the languages of the children into learning activities and routines\n- Ensuring play materials, room decorations, and celebrations reflect the various backgrounds of the children in the program and other racial and ethnic groups in the community\n- Choosing materials that reflect the cultures and languages of children and families enrolled in the program by displaying photographs of the children and families to reflect families' homes and everyday lives.[1]\nWelcoming families should also include providing a comfortable space for nursing mothers to feed their babies. For some centers, a genuinely  private  space  might  be  difficult  to  create.  Communicating  with  nursing  mothers  about  areas  close  by,  even  an administrator's office, lets mothers know they are welcome, and the program supports the choice to breastfeed.\n- [1] Office of Head Start and Office of the Administration for Children and Families.

Therefore, the environment in which infants and toddlers are placed has a tremendous impact. -Lally, Stewart, & Greenwald, 2009, pp. 1.[1] An environment supportive of sensorimotor development includes areas of diverse physical exploration: vertical spaces, small spaces and multi-height obstacles to navigate. Caregivers must go beyond using sensory tables and allow children full body exploration of the environment using their senses.

Spaces may influence infants and toddlers more than older children and adults since young children cannot change their environment or move to another area (Lally, Stewart, & Greenwald, 2009).\nThe spaces a child inhabits introduce the places where people feel welcome, meet, rest, and eat. When these places are familiar ones, similar to the child's home, the environment can help an infant feel safe and connected to the place.\nA well-designed environment sets the tone for intimacy that will strengthen the quality of relationships and interactions.[6]\nMaking thoughtful and careful decisions about a child's surroundings creates a nurturing, relationship-supporting environment in center-based and home-based childcare settings. Creating an environment that promotes respectful and responsive relationships is crucial to infants' and toddlers' growth and development.[7] Young children develop unique relationships with teachers and rely on these relationships for security and support in the learning environment.[8] Including pictures of the children and their families, providing  personal  storage  space,  and  displaying  children's  artwork  communicates  to  infants  and  toddlers  the  space  belongs  to them. When hanging pictures or adding decorative touches, place them at the children's eye level to reinforce that they are valued members of the classroom space. Consider taping photos to the floor so mobile infants can see them as they move through the room. (The Ohio State University for the US Department of Defense's Office of Family Policy/Children and Youth, 2021)\nFigure : Framed pictures are excellent ways to highlight children's families in accessible ways. ([3]) 27.12.1\nFigure : Create documentation in your environment at eye levels in accordance with their intended audience. ([3]) 27.12.1\nAnother  aspect  of  a  relationship-supporting  environment  is  a  home  like  atmosphere.  Young  children  spend  many  hours  in  the program setting. Therefore, it should become a home away from home: a place of community and togetherness. Children are more likely to feel they can be themselves and have a sense of belonging when their classroom environment is like their homes. Family childcare homes already provide this atmosphere and do not look like miniature childcare centers. [7]\nThere are many ways to add personal touches to a classroom to create a home like feel.\n- Use light and color to create a pleasing, calming and inviting effect. Create natural or soft lighting with windows or lamps. Spending extended periods of time in the presence of bright lights and bright colors can be overwhelming.\n- Use fabric and other sound-absorbing materials to reduce unwanted noise.\n- Utilize soft furniture, such as a couch or large armchair.\n- Incorporate nontoxic plants.\n- Decorate with throw pillows or cushions, area rugs and repurposed furniture.\n- Display family photos of the children and staff.\n- Use inexpensive frames to hang children's artwork on the walls.\n- Decorate in neutral paint colors\nIn addition to places for privacy and quiet areas\nFigure : Home like infant environments.

Anticipating how infants and toddlers may want to use materials between areas offers them freedom to move materials from one learning area to another. This also gives infants and toddlers the opportunity to take charge of their learning and make their ideas come to life. For example, moving a dinosaur from the block area to the dramatic play area to be 'washed' in the play sink offers toddlers a way to express their budding imaginations.\nFigure : Use light tables with a variety of objects to future sensory interest. ([1]) 27.13.4\nFor rooms with only young infants, setting up specific learning areas may not be appropriate, as the entire room forms the learning area for infants.

Providing too many materials at one time may overstimulate children.\nFigure : Infant environment. ([5]) 27.13.5\nEven though caregivers create learning areas, infants and toddlers love to explore and should be allowed the freedom to carry toys and materials from one area of the room to another. Rather than limit movement between spaces, recognize the value in these behaviors and find ways to support this natural exploration of materials and space. Exploring and moving materials is an excellent topic for creating documentation for analysis and reflection when creating curriculum. What trends are observed in the movement of materials from one area to another? What do the infants and toddlers do with the moved materials? [6]"

Although flush toilets are preferred, 'potty areas' also work if they are in a well-ventilated place near a bathroom with running water and away from the food area. Toileting sites must be easily accessible to supervise toddlers. Provide more than 1 potty as 2 or 3 toddlers can sit on potties simultaneously; the children can  interact  and  learn  from  each  other.  Do  not  clean  potties  in  the  same  sink  where  handwashing  occurs.  Instead,  empty  used potties into a toilet and wash in a utility sink. Keep toilet paper, paper towels, liquid soap, handwashing facilities, and sanitizing supplies near the potty.\nFigure : Steps add access for different developmental needs. ([7]) 27.13.12\nWhen toddlers use a bathroom, they must have a teacher with them. The bathroom should be out of bounds or locked when not in use  to  keep  toddlers  from  playing  in  there.  Bathrooms  with  half  walls  provide  a  sense  of  privacy  while  allowing  teachers  to supervise visually both inside and outside of the bathroom area. Half walls also provide a visual connection for other children when their  primary care teacher cares for another child. The toileting area is often neglected when setting up the environment. Small touches can make this area inviting and friendly. Create an attractive and cheerful toileting area for toddlers; this may be a space they spend a lot of time in if they are potty training. Put pictures on the wall and use color to brighten the area (Lally, Stewart, and Greenwald 2009)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Mealtime\nEating areas for toddlers who can feed themselves encourage the development of fine motor skills. When planning these areas, use preventative measures to ensure safe and healthy experiences for infants and toddlers.\nDesign an area for meals that includes appropriately sized furniture for  infants  and  toddlers  as  well  as  comfortable  seating  for caregivers, and nursing mothers. When arranging this area, consider what feels comfortable holding a child, feeding her a bottle, and sitting next to her at a table while she feeds herself.[8]\nFigure : Family eating style. ([4] 27.13.13\nEating areas require accessible storage and easy-to-clean surfaces. Children need low, comfortable places to eat. Arrange a place for caregivers to sit with children while they eat. Low tables for up to 4 children work well and can be used for arts and crafts activities at other times. Consider tables that stack or fold out from the wall: they can be used for mealtimes, then stored away to enlarge the play space.\nYoung infants should be fed one at a time in the infant caregiver's arms in a comfortable adult sized chair with necessary items nearby on a table or shelf.\nFigure : Lap feeding can be more comfortable for young infants. ([9]) 27.13.14\nSeveral options are available for feeding older infants. Ideally, meals and snacks are served at a child sized table with small chairs and stools. When an infant begins to climb onto and sit on the stools, it is a sign that they are ready for low tables that they can get into and out of on their own. Leave a stool in the play area so infants can practice getting on and off.\nFor mobile infants, use child sized tables and chairs. A table for infants aged 12 to 18 months should be about 12 to 14 inches high. Toddlers need a table 16 to 18 inches tall to comfortably sit and eat, as well as to stand while engaging in messy play. When toddlers are seated, their feet should touch the floor. If their feet cannot touch the floor, the children will not feel stable while sitting and will have trouble using their hands and arms easily. Tables should be below chest height.\nToddlers will enjoy sitting in groups of 2 to 4 at small tables. Serve the food family style unless toddlers bring their lunches. When children and adults eat together, they engage in social time, helping to strengthen and support relationships.\nFigure : Toddlers enjoy exhibiting their growing independence and skills through self-feeding. ([1] 27.13.15\nNatural wood tables sealed with a high gloss coating are easy to clean. Sturdy chairs or backless stools are best to allow infants to move easily and independently during mealtime. Backless stools work well for mobile infants and toddlers who can approach the stool from the back and straddle it in a comfortable wide-legged position. Legless cube chairs take up a lot of space but can also be used for other purposes when turned over. Stackable chairs or stools also allow for a more flexible environment (Lally, Stewart, and Greenwald 2009)."

It is essential to plan for at least 4 kinds of storage in an infant and toddler learning space: open storage infants and toddlers can easily access, closed storage for caregiver materials, personal storage for belongings, and display storage for children's art and work (Dodge et al., 2010).\n- Open storage: For materials that are in active use, caregivers should carefully label and store them on open, easily accessible shelves. Open storage will help children build independence, and toddlers can avoid frustration when they easily find what they want and need.\n- Closed storage: Tools such as adult office supplies, cooking utensils, or cleaning fluids need to be stored securely when not in use. Designate and carefully label secure locations for these items; doing so helps caregivers maintain inventory and ensure children's safety.\n- Personal storage: Infants and toddlers also need individual spaces for personal things, such as diaper bags, clothing, supplies, and creations. Space for favorite items (e.g., stuffed animal, favorite blanket) can help infants and toddlers feel secure. When spaces are easily accessible for toddlers, they can retrieve personal items when needed.Even if young infants cannot access a personal space independently, individual spaces personalize the learning environment and help parents feel confident their children are treated and cared for as individuals with unique qualities and needs.\n- Child display: Storing and displaying artwork and portfolios sends powerful messages to children about the value of their work.\n- [1] Infant Environment by Above & Beyond Child Care and Education Center,MI is used with permission\n- [2] Image by Ms Linh Le Reggio is used with permission\n- [3] Image by Sarah Jensen is used with permission\n- [4] Image by Amanda Taintor at Clovis College Child Development Center is licensed CC: By-NC\n- [5] Infant Environment by Above & Beyond Child Care and Education Center,MI is used with permission\n- [6] U.S Department of Health and Human Services: Administration for Children and Families.

Kaiser Family Foundation, \" New Study \"; Thigpen, \"Outdoor Play: Combating Sedentary Lifestyles,\" 19-20). Researchers have identified several reasons for this decline, including:\n- Adult fears about crime and safety\n- Increased use of television, computer games, DVDs, and smartphones and tablets with digital media\n- More time spent indoors in structured activities\n- Childcare arrangements with limited free time\n- Loss of natural habitats\nAn increasing number of educators, health/mental health professionals, and other child advocates agree that this trend adversely affects young children's health and development. Richard Louv, a child advocacy expert, worries that children are disconnecting from the natural world, a condition he calls \"nature deficit disorder\" (Louv, 2008) According to his research, nature deficit disorder contributes to a rise in obesity, depression, and attention disorders. As young children \"spend less and less of their lives in natural surroundings, their senses narrow, physiologically and psychologically ....\" (Louv, Introduction).\nWhether children live in urban, suburban, or rural communities, the outdoor world provides new opportunities to observe, discover, and learn. In an outdoor environment, children's cognitive capacity to appreciate beauty, express creatively, and perceive sensory patterns and variety expand to all new heights.

The philosophy of the schools of Reggio Italy and Howard Gardner also understood and expounded upon the complementary nature of science and the aesthetic experience of young children (Edwards, C., L.

For example:\n- Young children are more likely to engage in the kinds of vigorous, physical play that strengthens their hearts, lungs, and muscles because they tend to play harder and for more extended periods outside (Thigpen, 2007).\n- Regularly spending time outdoors increases opportunities for infants and toddlers to crawl, toddle, walk, climb, and run freely. In addition to improving large motor skills, vigorous physical activity improves children's overall fitness level.\n- Spending time outdoors strengthens young children's immune systems. They experience fewer illness-related absences from childcare when they have daily opportunities to play outside (Sennerstam,2007)\n- Spending time outdoors provides access to vitamin D (Einstein College of Medicine, 2009). There is increasing concern that infants, toddlers, and older children are deficient in vitamin D. This vitamin is necessary for calcium absorption and strengthening teeth and bones.\n- Spending time outdoors positively affects young children's sleeping patterns. Natural sunlight helps regulate and balance sleepwake cycles ( Dewar, 2008).\n- Children who play outdoors are less likely to be nearsighted. Direct exposure to the bright, natural light of the outdoors may stimulate developing eyes in important ways, such as \"maintaining the correct distance between the lens and the retina-which keeps vision in focus\" (Aamodt and Chang, 2011).\n- Time spent outdoors provides children with protection against life stressors and helps them develop a general sense of peace and well-being (White,2004).\n- There is some evidence that playing in the dirt exposes children to a specific type of bacteria that may reduce anxiety and improve the ability to learn new tasks (American Society of Microbiology, 2009). The Outdoor Curriculum\nSpending time outdoors every day is a rich and vital part of the curriculum for infants and toddlers. From the very beginning, young children satisfy their curiosity by exploring with their senses. Being outside \"presents a new world of sights, sounds, smells, and tactile experiences\"(Thigpen,2007).[1]"

These may include crawling or rolling on grassy hills, standing and balancing on bumpy or unlevel surfaces, and jumping over puddles and sidewalk cracks. Small-motor muscles develop as children use a pincer grasp to pick up and fill containers with natural objects and materials or hold paintbrushes as they paint walls with water (Trister et al., 2015; Post et al., 2011). Children develop perceptual skills as they move their bodies through space in different ways and at different speeds and as they observe the world from different perspectives (e.g., lying on their  backs  on  a  blanket,  standing  on  top  of  a  hill,  or  swinging  back  and  forth  in  a  swing)  (Post  et  al., Tender Care and Early Learning , 253).[1]"

They understand that the sun dries puddles and melts snow and that wind makes things move. Infants and toddlers learn important science concepts as they explore and discover the properties of natural objects and materials.

Noticing  and  discriminating  sounds  is  a foundational skill for later literacy development. In the outdoor environment, infants notice different sounds and learn to identify and tell them apart.

Outdoor play spaces should be treated as an extension of the indoor environment. Suitable outdoor play spaces:\n- Provide safe and stimulating places to play and explore\n- Accommodate the differing needs, skills, and interests of young infants, mobile infants, and toddlers, including those with suspected delays and identified disabilities\n- Support nurturing adult-child interactions\n- Accommodate adult needs for comfort\n- Reflect staff and family beliefs, values, and culture\n- Incorporate natural elements and native plant life\nEasy access to the outdoors is desirable to accommodate the daily rhythms of toddlers. Access to a playground allows caregivers to respond to a child's changing needs, but in many centers, time on the playground is rigidly scheduled and may not accommodate the toddlers' needs. Programs can individualize their outdoor play spaces: caregivers, other staff, and even families consider what they  want  infants  and  toddlers  to  experience  in  the  outdoor  space.  They  decide  on  the  materials,  equipment,  and  other  design elements that support these experiences. Whether programs modify an existing space or create a new one, designing outdoor play spaces provides an excellent opportunity to involve families and collaborate with local resources and partners. Programs may find partnership  opportunities  with  agricultural  extension  agencies,  plant  nurseries,  landscape  professionals,  playground  architects, artists, civic organizations, and businesses.\nCenter-based  outdoor  play  spaces  should  be  designed  according  to  the  guidelines  in  the  most  recent  edition  of  the Public Playground Safety Handbook from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Home-based programs that provide socialization spaces with outdoor areas or public playgrounds during socializations may also look at the Public Playground Safety Handbook for relevant information.

Infants  and  toddlers  are  just  beginning  to  understand  what  is  and  is  not  safe  and  how  to  protect themselves. They need responsible adults to minimize outdoor health and safety risks and eliminate the most dangerous hazards so they can explore and play safely."

    "context_enriched_content": "Risk and Challenge\nAs caregivers consider safety, it is important to realize that no one can eliminate every possible risk. Minor bumps, cuts, scrapes, and  bruises  are  commonplace.  Some  risk-taking  is  important  and  necessary  for  young  children's  growth  and  development. (Almeras, Creating a Nature-Based Culture , slides 34-36.) Risk-taking teaches young children what is and is not possible. It also sets the stage for managing challenging situations later in life. What is considered safe or unsafe depends partly on children's ages and developmental levels (e.g., sand is deemed safe for toddlers but not for young infants, even with close supervision).\nReducing  risk  does  not  mean  limiting  play  equipment  or  enforcing  rules  that  restrict  young  children's  movement  or  ability  to explore the environment. An ideal outdoor play space encourages children to challenge themselves while also presenting little risk for  injury:  ideally,  an  area  with  high  challenge  but  low  risk.  Studies  show  high  challenge,  low  risk  playgrounds  are  the  best  at promoting the goals of outdoor learning. Children get more physical activity; develop better physical, cognitive, and social skills, including respect for others; and are happier and more resilient.

    "context_enriched_content": "Outdoor Policies\nBalancing outdoor play and exploration with safety means first implementing active supervision for all children, then reaching a common understanding with all adults of what it means to keep infants and toddlers healthy and safe while providing appropriate challenges. This includes identifying the benefits of risk-taking and defining reasonable risks.\nHere are examples of what to include in outdoor policies:\n- Requirements related to Active Supervision (U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Head Start, Active Supervision .) are essential in keeping children safe outdoors. For example, caregivers need to:\n- Maintain a 1:4 staff-child ratio at all times.\n- Use mobile phones or walkie-talkies to communicate between adults outdoors and indoors quickly and easily and, if necessary, emergency services.\n- Position themselves to see and hear children and use the time to observe children and engage with them rather than visiting with each other. During socialization, parents should interact one on one with their child.\n- Continually scan the outdoor play space to know where everyone is and what they are doing, and count children frequently, especially during transitions to and from the outdoor space.\n- Use what they know about each child's interests and skills to predict what they will do.\n- Create challenges children are ready for and support them in succeeding.\n- Offer different levels of assistance or redirection depending on each child's needs.\nWeather-related policies define when it is acceptable to take children outside. Outdoor experiences can occur in all kinds of weather conditions, including rain, snow, heat, cold, and wind, if common-sense precautions and safety procedures are taken. For example:\n- Monitor air quality. Some air quality levels pose significant health and safety risks for young children and adults.\n- Do not take children outside when there are blizzards, lightning, thunderstorms, or extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n- Know the appropriate types of child and adult clothing for different weather conditions. Whenever possible, provide extra outdoor clothing for children and adults. The lack of proper clothing often reduces the time spent outside rather than the weather condition itself. (Williams, \"Exploring the Natural World,\" 21).\n- Use shade, sunscreen, and protective clothing for infants younger than 6 months, bug repellent, and other protective substances.\n- Ensure safe, sanitary water play and sandboxes.\n- Arrange appropriate storage of medications when children are outdoors (e.g., EpiPens and inhalers for children with allergies and asthma). Medications should always be readily accessible. ®\n- Identify steps for handling insect bites and stings.\n- Research what to include in outdoor first aid kits.\nIn addition to outdoor policies, there are other important safety practices and procedures to consider.

A hat will protect their faces, ears, and the back of their necks.\n- Obtain written permission from children's parents/guardians to use sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 15. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen to screen out UVB and UVA rays\n- Apply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going outdoors to allow ample time for absorption into the skin. Children will need sunscreen reapplication every 2 hours if they are outside for more than an hour and more frequently if playing in the water.\n- For children older than 6 months, apply sunscreen to all exposed areas, including children's ears (if they are wearing a cap instead of a hat).\n- For children younger than 6 months, use sunscreen on small body areas, such as the face and the backs of the hands, if protective clothing and shade are not available."

However, some programs face challenges with limited or lack of outdoor play space or few safe places to go. In these situations, it is especially important to provide infants and toddlers with experiences connecting them with nature and opportunities for active outdoor play and exploration.\nAlthough there may be no easy answers, it is still important to determine what outdoor accommodations might be reasonable and appropriate  for  programs  and  families  with  less-than-ideal  circumstances.  Here  are  some  possible  options:  Greenman  and Lindstrom, Caring Spaces, Learning Places , 299; Greenman et al., Prime Time s, 298, 322\n- Use sidewalks as paths for wheeled toys and equipment.\n- Use sides of buildings as art walls.\n- Provide \"loose parts\" to transform the space.\n- Add logs, tree stumps, and smooth boulders to create new spaces and encourage large motor experiences.\n- Use neighborhood resources such as recreation centers, parks, open fields, and school or public playgrounds. Create a \"playground-in-a-box\" (e.g., a wheeled utility cart filled with blankets, a parachute, milk crates, balls, and other toys and equipment to take to more open space).\n- Take children on short outings using wagons, buggies, and strollers. Allow children who can walk to do so for at least part of the time, so they get the benefit of physical exercise.\n- Locate and use community gardens.\n- Plant nonpoisonous flowers in boxes or create small gardens in washtubs that are safely accessible to children and adults (American Academy of Pediatrics; American Public Health Association; National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education; and Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Department of Health and Human Services, Caring for Our Children (CFOC), \"Even Plants Can Be Poisonous.\").\n- Hang bird feeders, wind chimes, and banners where children can see them.\n- Bring nature inside. Consider putting buckets or other containers outside when it rains or snows, and then bring them in to see how much was collected. When possible, open windows (no more than 4 inches and use safety guards) to allow fresh air to come in. Provide safe, age and developmentally appropriate natural objects and materials for infants and toddlers to explore. These can include pinecones, small tree cookies (i.e., cross-sections of branches that show growth rings), twigs, leaves, snow, dirt, acorns, rocks, and shells. Closely supervise these explorations: it is developmentally appropriate for very young children to put objects in their mouths. Things considered safe for older toddlers to explore are not safe for younger children.\n- Draw children's attention to natural events they can see through the window, such as rain, snow, lightning, or wind blowing trees or leaves. Invite children to touch windowpanes to see if they are warm or cold. Point out and describe changes in outdoor conditions (e.g., how the amount of shady or sunny places changes depending on the time of day or how the light changes when clouds cover the sun).\nThis page titled 28.4: When Availability of Outdoor Play Space Is an Issue is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

Whether in outdoor play spaces, backyards, parks, or on front stoops, these opportunities take shape and place through relationships and interactions between caring, supportive adults and children. Infants and toddlers take their cues from the significant adults in their lives. They are more likely to respond positively and explore the outdoor environment when adults plan for, model, and support those explorations. Because staff and families play an essential role in connecting infants and toddlers to nature and the outdoors, program leaders must consider ways to facilitate and strengthen adult engagement with outdoor play and exploration."

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Observation\nWhat is observation? One online dictionary (Dictionary.com,2019) gives the following definitions for observation (noun):\n- An act or instance of noticing or perceiving\n- An act or instance of regarding attentively or watching\n- The faculty or habit of observing or noticing\n- The information or record secured by such an act\nObservation informs responsive care and teaching practices, learning experiences, environments, routines, and schedules.[1]\nThere is more to observing than watching what infants do, though. Observing involves focus and purpose. Stetson, Jablon, and Dombro (2009) defined observation as \"watching and listening to learn about individual children\" (Stetson et al., 2009). Caregivers watch and listen to children and families to learn about each child's development and figure out how each child is learning. Many describe observation as paying close attention to a child's behaviors, interactions, activities, and interests and noticing all aspects of the child's development (National Infant & Toddler Child Care Initiative, 2010). Both definitions stress the importance of observing to learn.\nWhether  we  realize  it  or  not,  we  constantly  observe  when  working  with  infants,  toddlers,  and  families.  For  many  caregivers, observation  becomes  second  nature,  part  of  what  we  do.  We  regularly  take  in  information,  and  consciously  or  not,  these observations inform our work and interactions.[2]\n[1] U.S Department of Health and Human Services ECLKC Child observation: The heart of individualizing responsive care for infants and toddlers is in the public domain\n[2]  U.S  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  ECLKC Look  at  Me!

    "context_enriched_content": "Why?\nThere are important reasons why caregivers observe infants and toddlers.\nThe most common purposes behind caregiver observation include to:\n- Learn about children to individualize care and the curriculum, including interactions, teaching practices, learning experiences, routines, and schedules\n- To measure and track children's progress in acquiring skills and concepts over time as part of the ongoing assessment cycle.\nWhen caregivers are intentional about observing children, they can better understand how young children think, feel, and learn about the world around them. In turn, these understandings aid caregivers in making decisions about providing responsive and informed care.\nRespectful observation reflects a belief that young children's behaviors have purpose and meaning and are worth attending to. The crucial part of observation involves a great deal of thinking beforehand (Cagliari, 2004). Caregivers who believe young children have goals and intentions ask themselves essential questions:\n- Why does this child do what he does?\n- What is he trying to communicate or accomplish?\n- How should I respond to support this child?\n- What could I do to support them?\"[1]\nObservation  becomes  one  tool  in  seeking  answers  to  these  questions.  It  provides  opportunities  to  engage  in  a  \"pedagogy  of listening\" (Cagliari, 2004). We often silo contexts for observation by separating our observation time into two distinct categories: observation  of  what  the  child  is  doing  now  and  observation  to  reflect  on  later.  But  a  caregiver  is  a  \"participating  observer\" (Cagliari, 2004). As the children actively build knowledge, caregivers watch and listen, and while observing, the caregiver can find \"strategies that will consequently guide the activities onward\" (Cagliari, 2004). Observing from a respectful point of view helps us make essential discoveries about children, such as what they are like as individuals, how they react to other children and adults, what  tasks  are  easy  or  hard  for  them,  and  how  they  convey  their  wants  and  needs (Dichtelmiller  and  Ensler,  2004).  These discoveries allow caregivers to be responsive to each child's interests and needs.[2]\nObservations  are  conducted  every  day  in  early  childhood  classroom  environments.  Caregivers  are  constantly  surveying  the environment. Forms of intentional observations are: completing safety checks to ensure the equipment and materials are safe for the  children  to  use  and  daily  health  screenings  to  ensure  children  are  healthy  enough  to  participate  in  activities.  Intentional caregivers use their observations to plan and implement curriculum, set up engaging learning environments, monitor the children's social  interactions,  track  behaviors,  communicate  with  families,  and  assess  each  child's  progress  and  development.  Through purposeful and planned observations, intentional caregivers can:\n- Evaluate program and caregiver effectiveness\n- Make improvements to ensure quality practices\n- Plan and implement developmentally appropriate curriculum\n- Measure and assess a child's development\n- Develop respectful family partnerships\n- Understand cultural practices\n- Choose learning strategies to support and accommodate the diverse needs of children\n- Ensure ethical conduct and professional standards of practice.[3]\n- [1]  U.S  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  ECLKC Look  at  Me!

    "context_enriched_content": "The importance of Accuracy\nObservation is like a photograph-it captures a moment in time. As an observer, you are like the photographer, focusing on some things, ignoring others. Like the photographer, you bring your ideas, preferences, and perceptions to the act of observing. (Jablon et al.,2007)\nIt takes practice to become a good observer. For caregivers, an essential aspect of being a respectful observer involves knowing that what they notice and how they interpret their observations about infants and toddlers may be influenced by many things. Culture, temperament,  the  presence  of  a  delay  or  disability,  personal  experiences  and  relationships,  professional  knowledge,  and  even community values and messages in the media affect how caregivers and families see and experience children. Our gut reactions and carefully considered opinions influence our observation behaviors (Cagliari, 2004).\nThese lenses through which caregivers observe and interpret cause influence, even though they may not always be conscious of them. For example, two adults may see an infant fuss but interpret what the fussy behavior means and respond differently based on their  own  experiences,  education,  and  culture  (Cagliari,  2004).  Observing  young  children  involves  self-awareness,  and  this awareness evolves.\nEvery person comes from a culture, and every family's culture is unique. Culture-attitudes, beliefs, expectations about people and events-shape caregivers as humans and early childhood professionals. For example, some cultures consider it respectful to look someone in the eye when speaking or being spoken to, while others consider it respectful to look down when someone is speaking. A caregiver whose culture values looking someone in the eye when speaking may think that a child or family member whose culture values eyes down when someone speaks is ignoring them or disrespectful. This interpretation can then influence the words used in observation.\nTraits such as temperament (e.g., being cautious, outgoing, or sensitive; requiring order), personal interests and preferences, and feelings (e.g., what makes us feel excited, apprehensive, uncomfortable) also affect how adults relate to children. These traits may help them feel closer to children with similar characteristics. They may pay more attention to children with similar characteristics and observe them more frequently than other children. These traits may also drive adults away from children whose attributes are different. Caregivers may pay them less attention or interpret their behaviors more negatively. For example, a caregiver who has a high tolerance for bright lights, environmental noise, and excess materials on shelves and walls may have difficulty figuring out that those same things may overstimulate an infant who cries frequently.[1]\n[1] U.S Department of Health and Human Services ECLKC Child observation: The heart of individualizing responsive care for infants and toddlers is in the public domain\nThis page titled 29.4: Accurate Observations for Accurate Documentation is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "Two Important Terms to Know\nIntentional caregivers must understand the importance of objective and not subjective observation. The dictionary defines objective as:  not  influenced  by  personal  feelings  or  opinions  in  considering  and  representing  facts,  contrasted  with  the  definition  of subjective:  based  on  or  influenced  by  personal  feelings,  tastes,  or  opinions  (Dictionary.com,  retrieved  2022).  Scientists  use objective evidence over subjective evidence to reach sound and logical conclusions, just as infants are born scientists (Babies are Born Scientists, 2012), observing caregivers are scientists as well.\nObjective observation is without personal bias and the same by all individuals. Humans are biased by nature, so they cannot be completely objective; the goal is to be as unbiased as possible. A subjective observation is based on a person's feelings and beliefs and is unique to that individual.[1]\nObserving objectively means writing down all you see and hear and recording only those behaviors directly observed. For most, this is much more difficult than the simple definition implies. It takes practice for caregivers to become skilled in separating the facts they observe from their opinions, biases, or reflections during the observation."

You will get a definition similar to: \"prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.\"\nIt is important to realize we might not be fully aware of all our biases, even if we are aware of some. Our biases are at play in our interpretations of behaviors we often observe without recognizing their influence. For example, when a child says, \"give me some milk!\" Our first response might be, \"how do you ask?\" We might not realize that manners (or lack of them) influence our reactions in a specific way. Caregivers must recognize how they feel towards the child's behavior influences how we see them and thus what we choose to observe and document.[1]\nCommon Subjective Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Observation Evidence\n- Making Conclusions: \"Billie can't do anything by himself because he is the youngest in a large family, and they do everything for him\"; \"Sharon's parents are getting a divorce, so she is sad\"\n- Making Assumptions: \"Annie never shares\"; \"Denise always hits Thomas\"\n- Labeling: \"Rosie is mean\"; \"Jeff is such a good boy\"\n- Comparing: \"Tommy can't ride the bike as well as Sam\"; \"Zoey was the best listener at circle time.\"\n- Focusing on Feelings or Emotions/Mood: \"Max looks so sad today\"; \"Jax looks so happy as he slides down the slide.\"\n- Adding Opinions/Subjective: \"Martha likes playing dress-up; she is in the dramatic play area every day.\"; \"Suki is shy and never says anything during circle time.\" (put in your parking lot). [2]\nTo the extent possible, caregivers need to acknowledge biases and the influences of our cultural lens and then remove those from observations  and  be  intentional  in  removing  them  from  the  documentation.  The  necessity  to  remove  subjective  and  sometimes biased observations does not automatically imply \"wrong-ness.\" The subjective thought could align with the caregiver's cultural, personal, or religious values. What a person believes is often what makes us unique (remember the definition of objective?), but those unique views and reflections do not belong in our objective observation or documentation. Biases get in the way of what behavior is happening. When you first begin to document your observations, a helpful exercise is to physically write down the subjective thoughts into a separate area; some choose to label this the \"parking lot\" or select another label identifying it as a place to move subjective observations. As you complete more observations, the act of moving subjective thoughts out of the way of our objective observations will become easier.

Understanding the difference between these two terms can be difficult.

An objective observation does not give one-word labels such as strong-willed, aggressive, temperamental, sweet, friendly, or bad.

A great way to start is to think about a list of emotions you might try to use in your documentation. Examples most typically used are: Happy,  Sad,  Angry,  Mad.  When  we  use  the  words  happy,  sad,  and  angry  in  our  documentation,  we  interpret  the  mood  from observed behaviors. Let's take a look at the mood happy. If a caregiver documents the child is \"happy,\" they observe a specific behavior that makes them make the statement. The child might be smiling, laughing, giggling, or jumping excitedly. When we only document the word \"happy,\" we don't know the demonstrated behavior. How about sad? If I document \"the child was sad.\" Does another person reading my documentation know exactly what behavior the child is exhibiting? No, they wouldn't. You could guess, but you can't say if you were right, and a guess then violates another critical consideration of observation: Accuracy. If we describe the mood of sad, we might document it as, \"the child began to softly cry into their hands, turning the face away from their peers.\" Does that description allow you to picture what is going on much more accurately?\nThis page titled 29.4.4: Interpreting Mood is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

For example, observe children:\n- Across environments (e.g., indoor and outdoor) and different times of the day (e.g., morning and afternoon)\n- During routines (e.g., mealtimes, diapering and toileting, naptime, dressing, arrival, and departure)\n- As they engage in play experiences and move from one play experience to another\n- As they interact with other children and adults\nDevelop a plan to make sure each child is observed regularly (e.g., once a day or week). When using an observation method that requires stepping back for a period to observe, such as a running record, coordinate that observation time with another adult to ensure children are supervised, and teacher-child ratios are maintained.\nRepeat observations over time. A single observation does not provide enough information to determine what a child knows and can do entirely.  Children's  behaviors  are  not  always  consistent.  Many  factors  (e.g.,  illness,  lack  of  sleep,  hunger,  changes  at  home, changes in the daily schedule, staff changes, the developmental process) can influence what children do and say from day to day, and even from hour to hour.

    "context_enriched_content": "Introduction to Documentation\nA foundation for high-quality care includes using information collected through observation and documentation to assess infant and toddler development and support developmentally appropriate curriculum creation. According to NAEYC (2009), there needs to be an organized information collection system to guide classroom decisions. Caregivers' observation and the documentation created from those observations make infant and toddler learning visible (Rinaldi 2001), a concept first brought to light by the schools of Reggio  Emilia,  Italy.  Through  detailed  descriptive  notes,  photos,  recordings,  and  drawings,  caregivers  reflect  on  an  infant  or toddler's  ideas,  intentions,  or  feelings  during  play.  When  we  document  infant  and  toddler  learning  and  collect  key  artifacts,  we create  tangible  evidence  to  share  with  the  infant  and  toddler,  their  families,  administrators,  and  other  stakeholders.  Observing infants and toddlers at play reveals much about their process of information gathering and making sense of their world. Rinaldi (1994, 59) explains that young infants and toddlers 'ask us to listen, to observe, and support them and to render them visible.' Caregivers 'render them visible' by recording what they see infants and toddlers do or say, then reflecting on and interpreting those observations.  When  infants  and  toddlers  take  action  to  explore  different  possibilities,  they  are  testing  their  own  hypotheses (Gopnik,  Meltzoff,  and  Kuhl  2000;  Gopnik  2009).  Observing,  reflecting,  and  creating  documentation  on  infants'  and  toddlers' actions or a verbal toddler's explanations serves as a window into their curious and creative minds.[1]\n[1] Early Education and Support.

Learning how to address this challenge takes time and a sound support system. Caregivers can develop plans together for observing and recording behavior within the context of daily routines and events. Some caregivers take turns; others have systems such as cameras and note cards placed around the indoor and outdoor areas so they can take quick notes or photos in the moment. There are many ways to participate and observe at the same time. Infants and toddlers become accustomed to caregivers who take notes and photos; the process of observing and recording behavior becomes a regular part of daily routines. Documentation from caregivers who are involved daily with infants and toddlers is the most useful because the caregiver understands the infant's and toddler's context: everything from how the infant or toddler slept the night before to his current interests. Infant and toddler caregivers who observe regularly are better able to provide care and education that connects with each infant and toddler.[1]\n[1] The California Infant/Toddler Curriculum Framework by the California Department of Education is used with permission\nThis page titled 30.3: Observation and Documentation While Participating is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

Caregivers should utilize several methods as part of their regular documentation routines. The tools and strategies caregivers use to document force choices to be made: caregivers must take time to intentionally  choose  the  best  documentation  tool  for  the  intended  communication.  Infant  and  toddlers  have  the  right  to explain their creativity and their way of seeing the world. Caregivers must respect the different processes infants and toddlers use to build their knowledge and choose documentation with this in mind: it is crucial to find strategies to understand the processes of knowledge exploration and sustain, not suffocate, these processes (Cagliari, 2004).\nThe following methods are the most common for collecting and recording data :"

They  are  brief, focused notes about one event or incident from an infant or toddler's day. The key to creating an anecdotal record is to concentrate on one specific event or activity. When creating an anecdotal record, capturing the beginning, middle, and end of a particular event is often referred to as the ABCs.\n- A= Antecedent: what happened before the event\n- B= Behavior: the specific behavior being captured\n- C= Consequence: what happened after the behavior\nAnecdotal  records  offer  a  window  of  opportunity  into  an  infant  or  toddler's  actions,  interactions,  and  reactions  to  people  and events.  When  caregivers  later  analyze  this  collection  of  narratives,  the  anecdotal  records  can  showcase  an  infant  or  toddler's progress over time.

    "context_enriched_content": "Running Records\nThe primary goal for running records is to 'obtain a detailed, objective account of behavior without inference, interpretations, or evaluations'  (Bentzen,  2009,  p.112).  Running  records  contain  many  elements  of  an  anecdotal  record  but  go  further  than  one specific narrative. The details recorded in a running record contain elements resembling an ethnography. An ethnography is the indepth study of everyday practices of people's lives: it produces a detailed description of the studied group at a particular time and location. These descriptions document the behavior or cultural event in question and the context in which it occurs (Scheib et al., 2021). These elements can also be present in a running record. The attitudes, perspectives, and motivations describe the entire situation. Documenting the whole situation in a running record requires much more information than an anecdotal record (Swim & Douville-Watson, 2011). Good documentation includes the ability to close your eyes and 'see' the images in your mind as they are\ndescribed  in  the  running  record  (Bentzen,  2009).  This  level  of  detail  also  applies  to  anecdotal  records.  To  complete  a  running record, caregivers often schedule a day, time, and setting to observe a specific infant or toddler or group of infants and toddlers. Although not necessary, caregivers decide on the observation's purpose, reason, or focus (e.g., cognitive skills, social interactions, play patterns).[1]\nIn both an anecdotal record and a running record, a caregiver may create 2 separate categories in their documentation. One category contains the objective factual observation, while a separate section records the caregiver's inferences. Inferences are conclusions that an observer draws from the interpretation of objective observations. (Wittmer & Petersen, 2010)"

They can also include quick notes about milestone behaviors noticed, an activity the infant  or  toddler  engaged  in,  or  an  overall  synopsis  of  the  infant  or  toddler's  day.  Daily  logs  are  not  the  place  to  comment  on concerns or problem behaviors. Behaviors of concern are recorded on other forms of documentation, and if needed, a conversation occurs with the family at a scheduled time."

Personal journals can be made from any materials: inexpensive composition notebooks are frequently implemented.\nCaregivers should spend a few minutes at the end of every day jotting notes about the infant or toddler. These notes can replicate the daily log records or include more in-depth description. Caregivers do not need to record in every individual journal every day. A practice of spending a few minutes at the end of the day documenting in a few individual journals will make it possible for even the busiest of caregivers to create valuable documentation for assessment and curriculum development. Journals (and other forms of documentation) can also be used during family-caregiver conferences or move with the infant or toddler to the next classroom. Home-school  journals  contain  the  same  elements  as  an  individual  journal,  but  also  function  as  a  communication  tool  to  send information back and forth between school and home. Families are encouraged to write and respond to the caregiver's observations or  notes  (Swim  &  Douville-Watson,  2011).

    "context_enriched_content": "Documentation Panels\nDocumentation panels contain photos, transcripts of conversations, caregivers' notes, and artifacts from one infant or toddler or a group  of  infants  and  toddlers  (Klien,  2008).  Documentation  panels  move  beyond  bulletin  boards  or  art  displays  because  they function  as  intentional  communication  (Tarini,  1997).  They  attempt  to  communicate  the  complexity  of  an  infant  or  toddler's experience, as well as the learning taking place during those experiences (Helm & Beneke, 2003).\nWhen documentation panels are displayed at infant and toddler eye level, they allow infants and toddlers the opportunity to revisit their learning in a format that is easy to visually observe and provides visual prompts for caregivers to have conversations revisiting the experience. Viewing documentation invites curiosity and confidence as infants and toddlers revisit their work and contemplate their  accomplishments  (Malaguzzi,1998).  A  documentation  panel  can  display  a  variety  of  interactions  visually:  child/child, child/adult, and child/material (Klien, 2008). Artfully displaying the contents of a documentation panel serves as a visual archive of an infant or toddler's learning for directors, parents, and community members to view easily (Helm, Beneke, & Steinheimer, 1998). Documentation panels draw parents into the classrooms and serve as a springboard for conversations (Saltz, 1997). For centers and family childcare organizations utilizing project-based curriculum, documentation panels provide the space to convey the infant and toddler's experiences and learning throughout the project (Kline, 2008). Caregivers may put a set of photographs side by side to\nshow a sequence of actions or learning experiences. This technique sheds light on a wide range of learning (for example, an infant and toddler's understanding of routines or an infant and toddler's fine motor development). [2]"

Photographs,  video,  and  audio  recordings  can  authentically  capture  infant  and  toddler  explorations,  investigations,  play,  and learning experiences in the actual moment.\nWith  this  type  of  documentation,  caregivers  can  replay  critical  moments  in  an  infant  or  toddler's  day  to  look  for  specific interactions, play patterns, developmental milestones, struggles, accomplishments, and how infants and toddlers solve problems. Caregivers can also listen for language development by recording infant and toddler conversations with their peers. Technology provides opportunities for caregivers to share documentation with infants and toddlers in their classrooms.\nThere are numerous ways to incorporate technology into a classroom. Each center should develop its own protocol, policies, and procedures concerning the use of technology. What is permissible and not allowed should be clearly stated and known by all adults. Technology allows for easily sharing images and videos with the infant or toddler's family, but some infants and toddlers require special protection from public transmission or display of their images. Infant and toddlers in foster care, protected custody, or part of more private families might be prohibited from how and where images are shown and shared.\nHere are a few suggestions for integrating technology into observation and documentation practices:\n- Use a camera, laptop, tablet, or smartphone to record observations and take pictures.\n- Ask a toddler to tell a story, then type it up on a computer or use an audio recorder.\n- Scan or make copies of an infant or toddler's work, such as drawings or writing, to create a visual timeline showing an infant or toddler's skill development over time.\n- Use email or a communication app to post work samples.\n- Take pictures of 3-dimensional work: for example, woodworking projects, block towers, sandcastles, and culinary creations.\nUse  a  video  camera  to  document  how  infants  and  toddlers  progress  with  their  developmental  milestones  in  each  domain.  For example, look at playful interactions to track social-emotional development.\nCameras and media recorders, including smartphones and tablets, offer quick, efficient ways to document what infants and toddlers say and do. Before jumping into a technology purchase, make sure to consider the following:\n- Family access to technology\n- The length of audio and video clips: the longer the clip, the larger the file (large files take up precious storage space). Long audio and video clips also take more time to review and analyze later.\n- Costs for:\n- Buying cameras and recorders\n- Equipment\n- Software to download, store, play, and print files\n- Film development (if not using a digital camera)\n- Upkeep (e.g., batteries, repair)\n- Time for other caregivers in the program to learn and train on new technology [1]"

    "context_enriched_content": "Accuracy and Completeness\nHow important is accurate observation and documentation? If you were asked to write down one thing you did yesterday, how well would you remember the details of that moment? What if you were asked to write down a moment from one week ago today? Which of those memories would have more accurate details? Most would answer that recording a memory from yesterday would be more accurate and detailed than the record of an event from a week ago. Yet many caregivers try to document observations days or weeks after an event. Upcoming deadlines, such as a family conference or assignment due date, often prompt caregivers to sit down and create  documentation  from  past  observations.  Unfortunately,  waiting  to  record  information  diminishes  accuracy  and clarity.\nLet's  take  this  exercise  further.  What  if  you  needed  to  write  down  a  conversation  from  yesterday?  From  last  week?  From  last month? Can you recall the details of what you said? Which memory would be most accurate: the one from yesterday, last week, or last month? How confident could you be of the accuracy of what was said?\nObservation notes need to be accurate, objective and factual. Accurate observation notes include facts and details about the order in which they occur. Consider the following story about Gabriel (33 months), which occurs during a home visit. Here is the entire exchange:\n\"Gabriel and his mom are next to each other. Each one is building a tower using large plastic blocks. Gabriel builds his tower as tall as he is. He bumps into the tower with his arm. The tower falls over and knocks down the block tower that his mother built. Gabriel laughs and jumps up and down while clapping his hands. His mom laughs, claps her hands, and hugs Gabriel.\"\nHere is what the caregiver documented:\n\"Gabriel builds a tower as tall as he is using large plastic blocks. He starts to laugh, jump up and down, clap his hands, and bumps into his tower, knocking it down and his mom's tower down, too.\"\nThis observation note created by the caregiver is not accurate. It contains facts out of order (laugh, jump up and down, clap his hands, and bump into his tower). It is also missing information (Gabriel and his mother are next to each other, each one is building a tower, Gabriel's mom laughs, claps her hands, and hugs Gabriel). Accuracy matters. Over time, inaccurate observation notes may lead to erroneous interpretations or misunderstandings of what an infant or toddler can do.\nHere are additional tips to write accurate observation notes:\n- Note the infant or toddler's name and the person making the observation.\n- Note the date/time of the observation, setting (e.g., indoor/outdoor, routine, play experience), and other infants, toddlers, or adults involved.\n- Use abbreviations, short phrases, symbols, drawn pictures, and other shorthand inventions to capture information quickly.\n- Use phonetic spellings to capture vocalizations (e.g., buh-buh-buh-mmmm) and word attempts (e.g., \"peez\" for \"please\").\n- Observe with a partner and then compare observations.[1]\nCaregivers often document a behavior, but miss what happened before (antecedent) and what happened after (consequence). To capture an entire event, caregivers need to include the ABCs.\n- Antecedents - Environmental events or stimuli that trigger a behavior\n- Behavior - What people do, say, think or feel\n- Consequence - Outcome of a behavior [2]"

However, play should rarely be part of documentation. What comes to mind if asked to describe an infant or toddler at play? It could include a few toddlers in the sociodramatic area pretending to cook dinner, an infant or toddler digging a hole in the sandbox, or a single infant stacking blocks or investigating a piece of fabric. If the word play were used to document each scene, information would be limited by saying 'the infant played' because the details are missing. The word 'play' might fit as a generalization, but it doesn't provide curriculum development or assessment details. If a caregiver writes, \"Javier was playing house,\" many details for later analysis are missing. However, if the caregiver writes, 'Javier grasped the pot with his left\nhand. He clutched a wooden spoon firmly with his right hand and slowly mixed the pretend soup in a clockwise circle. Sarina walked over and handed Javier the spices and stated, 'make the soup better,'' more visual details and information for assessment or curriculum  development  purposes  are  included.

    "context_enriched_content": "Portfolios\nCaregivers often use individual portfolios to hold evidence of an infant or toddler's learning. A portfolio provides notes, photos, and work samples that demonstrate the infant or toddler's understanding of critical concepts and skills.[1] Portfolios can be created with a binder or notebook, a file or accordion-style folder, or a cardboard box. Unused pizza boxes with the infant or toddler's name printed on the end are an easy way to collect documentation for later organization. Including clear dates on documentation pieces allows for chronological organization at a later time.\nA clear organization system helps track each infant and toddler's progress throughout the school year. Having dates on each piece removes concern over putting items in perfect order when pressed for time. Caregivers can go in later and organize chronologically. Portfolios allow caregivers to construct a well-rounded and authentic picture of each infant and toddler in their class. Knowing the whole  infant  and  toddler  better  equips  caregivers  to  build  on  each  infant  and  toddler's  interests  and  plan  developmentally appropriate activities.\nIf utilizing portfolios, provide an individual file for each infant and toddler. A well-organized portfolio contains observations and artifacts of infant and toddlers' work collected at different periods throughout the year. Include documentation that highlights each developmental domain. For example:\n- Gross Motor: Include photographs of the infant or toddler engaged in outside activities like running, jumping, climbing, riding a bike, or playing in the sandbox.\n- Fine Motor: Use a checklist or other documentation of when the infant or toddler learns to button, zip, and tie his shoes. Include work samples of cutting, coloring, and painting.\n- Social-Emotional : Utilize anecdotal or running records of infants and toddlers engaging in open-ended, infant and toddlerdirected play.\n- Note sharing, taking turns, and cooperation with others.\n- Employ frequency count/event sampling to see in which centers infant and toddlers choose to spend their time, and tally play patterns to see if they prefer to play alone or with others.\n- Cognitive: Chart a science experiment and take photos.\n- Use a video camera to record an infant or toddler as she stacks blocks. Record any explained process in the build.\n- Literacy and Oral language : Save writing examples to track writing.\n- Write down quotes in an anecdotal and running record.\n- Make audiotapes of conversations during circle time.\n- Creative expression : Videotape engagement in the dramatic play area.\n- Videotape dancing to music (this can also be excellent documentation for motor development).\n- Photograph a clay creation, painting, or block tower.\nPortfolios  tell  the  story  of  the  whole  infant  or  toddler.

A note, photo, or work sample invites families to interpret the caregivers' observations and reflective planning.[1] Caregivers may combine photos with notes to create a book of an infant or toddler's learning experiences to share with the infant or toddler's family.\nFamilies appreciate seeing their infant or toddler's progression, how they interact with others, and the types of activities their infant or toddler engages in. Families have the right to be part of the process taking place in the school (Cagliari, 2004). They are also an essential source of information during the reflection process. Families can answer questions and help interpret an infant or toddler's behaviors and interactions. They can continue to share what they have observed at home and the strategies that work for them. By including families in documentation reflection, the infant or toddler's family members will often add insights and a perspective that the caregivers may not have considered.[2] Regularly sharing observations and actively pursuing a family's input and perspectives on their infant or toddler gives caregivers fuller views of an infant or toddler as an individual. Discussing observations through documentation  provides  families  the  opportunity  to  work  in  partnership  or  take  the  lead  in  their  infant  or  toddler's  care  and education. Sharing reflections on infant and toddler observations helps create a mutually respectful environment that promotes the infant's, toddler's and family's needs.[3]\nThe  following  example  from  volume  3  of  the  California  Preschool  Curriculum  Framework  (CDE  2013,  35)  illustrates  how caregivers use documentation to invite families to join them in work:\nDuring the small-group face-drawing activity, Clayton was picking out pencils for his skin color when his mother arrived to pick him up. She knelt near the table as Connie read the name printed on the colored pencil that Clayton had selected. 'This one says, sienna brown.' What do you think, Clayton?' Connie asked as she moved the tip of the pencil near his arm. 'Is that your color?' Clayton smiled at his mother: 'I'm sienna brown, mommy. Which one do you want to be?' A few minutes later, when Clayton was retrieving his things from his cubby, his mother confided in Connie how much she had enjoyed picking out her skin color with Clayton.  She  had  been  uncertain  about  how  to  talk  with  Clayton  about  skin  color  because  she  was  of  European-American background and Clayton's father was African American. Most of the family members living nearby were Caucasian. They discussed the possibility of doing an activity at the next parent meeting. All parents could explore the variety of flesh-toned colored pencils and even blend different tints of homemade play dough that they could take home to enjoy with their infant and toddlers.\n- [1] Early Education and Support.

(Parlakian, 2001, p. 16)\nOnce caregivers have observed and documented facts about each infant and toddler, they must do something with those facts. As part of ongoing infant and toddler assessment, caregivers review the facts and reflect on what they mean. When caregivers review anecdotal  notes,  photos,  videos,  or  other  samples,  they  piece  together  stories  that  portray  the  development  of  the  infants  and toddlers in their care. Caregivers may review multiple pieces of documentation (video recordings, notes, photographs, and so forth) to deepen their understanding of an individual infant or toddler. Observation notes might clarify why an infant or toddler is making rapid progress in one developmental domain while continuing to practice at about the same level of competency in another domain. [1] Caregivers consider what the information says about an infant or toddler's development, interests, and needs. The answers to these questions lead to individualized care and a supportive curriculum. [2]\nQuestions caregivers ask while reflecting on documentation might include:\n- What developmental skill or activity does the infant or toddler appear to be working on?\n- What strategies does the infant or toddler use to play with different toys?\n- Does the infant or toddler engage with objects or people differently than he did a month ago? What has changed? What has not changed?\n- Do my actions and the actions of other adults who interact with the infant or toddler affect the outcomes of the infant or toddler's experience? If so, how so?\n- How does the information relate to goals for the infant or toddler?

Ongoing assessment helps families and caregivers know how a child is progressing and helps teachers set goals and plan experiences for the program. As part of engaging in continuous quality improvement, programs assess infants' and toddlers'  developmental  progress  and  learning.  [1]Caregivers  must  understand  diverse  assessment  approaches,  purposes,  uses, benefits, and limitations.[2]\nCaregivers use assessments for various purposes (Snow and Van Hemel 2008). In the Principles and Recommendations for Early Childhood Assessments (National Education Goals Panel 1998), 4 broad goals for early childhood assessment were established: [1]\n- To promote learning and development of individual children\n- To identify children who may have delays, disabilities, or health conditions\n- To monitor trends in programs and evaluate program effectiveness\n- To obtain benchmark data for accountability purposes at local, state, and national levels\nAlthough a one-time, easily administered assessment may offer some information about children's development, it is better to use a variety of instruments and methods over time to gain a more comprehensive picture of development.[1]"

Continuous assessment provides feedback about children's progress and guides learning experiences.[1]\nCaregivers should regularly add anecdotes, photos, and samples to a child's portfolio or file: this provides a basis for assessing each infant or toddler's developmental progress. These items provide evidence and information to complete formal assessments later, which  produce  profiles  of  each  child's  developmental  progress.  Assessments  for  developmental  monitoring  should  occur  on  a regular schedule, such as every 4 or 6 months. Designing a schedule for each child or facility helps ensure this type of assessment occurs regularly. [3]\nAssessment profiles give caregivers a general orientation for supporting each infant or toddler over weeks and months; they help the caregiver be sensitive to the next steps in each child's development and plan accordingly.[3]"

The  importance  of  gathering  information  from  multiple  sources  applies  to  all  children,  but  it  is  essential  when assessing children with disabilities or other delays. Periodic assessment of children's development provides a firm basis for referral if a delay or disability is suspected.[1]\nFor children receiving services from other sources (such as therapy through insurance or special education through an Individual Family Services Plan or IFSP), work with family members to gather input from specialized service professionals. The specialized service professional may send reports to or talk directly with caregivers with the families' permission. Comprehensive development tests, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, are often considered the gold standard in the developmental assessment of infants and young children [Walder, 2009]. These tests offer comprehensive information on a child's current developmental status, are administered directly with the child, and offer scores for the assessed areas (Albers,2006).\nBriefer  approaches  to  developmental  assessments  often  function  as  screening  instruments  designed  to  identify  children  with developmental delays who require further assessment (Rydez,2005). Screening instruments will differ in whether they are based on direct assessment with the child or secondary reports [Fernald,et. al,2009; Macy,2012; Kvestad et al, 2013)"

For dual language learners who typically use their home language  to  communicate,  authentic  assessment  must  include  assessment  in  their  home  language  and  English  (State  Advisory Council on Early Learning and Care 2013, Paper 5 [Assessment]). When assessment is an ongoing practice, teachers and program administrators can make effective instructional adaptations that build on children's prior knowledge and support new learning for each child.[2]\nWhen using observation as an assessment method, teachers should:\n- Observe the behavior of the infants and toddlers throughout the entire day.\n- Observe children when they are alone, with peers, family members, and teachers.\n- Incorporate observation and assessment processes into daily routines and activities.\n- Review assessments tool regularly and keep developmental themes in mind while observing the behavior.\n- Hold conversations with toddlers about their experiences and their work.

(ASQ-3) is a widely used screening tool for infants and young children's development that assesses development in 5 domains: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, and Personal Social [Squire et  al.,  2009].  Developmental  areas  covered  by  this  screening  tool  include  self-regulation,  compliance,  communication,  adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and interaction with people.[2] The ASQ system is initially a parent-completed questionnaire, but it may also be completed by a professional interacting with the child (Kvestad et al, 2013) . The ASQ-3 provides an opportunity to address parental concerns, educate parents on child development, and empower parents to advocate for their children. It identifies children at risk of having possible developmental delays, detects a child's strengths and needs, and can be used to predict future school-related challenges.[2]\nParental reports provide a risk of inaccuracy or overstatements regarding the child's development (Fernald et al., 2009). However, the ASQ system is developed and based on the conviction that families can provide information for proper assessments of their children.  For  instance,  a  study  comparing  the  ASQ  completion  of  low  and  middle-income  parents  in  the  US,  followed  by subsequent assessment by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, shows no differences in the accuracy of scoring in the 2 groups of parents.

An appropriate curriculum for infants and toddlers provides guidance and strategies for supporting development and learning, engaging in responsive interactions to build relationships, and partnering with families. It is essential to consider what learning looks like in the minds of infants and toddlers. Children from birth to 5 do not build or acquire their knowledge and skills in domain-specific categories one domain at a time. They relate to each learning experience as a whole experience. They naturally cross the boundaries of  domains  and  simultaneously  build  concepts  related  to  social-emotional  development,  science,  mathematics,  language,  social sciences, the arts, physical development, and health.[1]\nA good curriculum leaves decisions about what this looks like to the caregiver implementing the curriculum. When it comes to curriculum, caregivers must:\n- Have room to discover an infant or toddler's \"individual curriculum\" (e.g., the child's interests, motivations, and needs).\n- Choose and offer experiences that match a child's (or small group of children's) interests and developmental level\n- Use everything that happens as a learning opportunity, both planned/intentional and spontaneous.\n- Create environments that reflect children and families served in the program.\nA responsive, relationship-based curriculum supports child-initiated, child-pursued opportunities to individualize within the chosen or created curriculum\n[1]  Early  Education  and  Support  Division,  California  Department  of  Education.

It is only within the context of secure, nurturing  relationships  with  parents,  family  members,  and  other  caring  adults  that  healthy  infant  and  toddler  development  and learning happen. Infants are biologically programmed to expect those in their world to care for them, protect them, and do so in a loving way. (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) Individualizing care and curriculum involves tailoring to each child's needs. No 2 infants or toddlers are the same; each child is unique, making a \"one size\" curriculum, experience, or interaction a poor fit for all infants and  toddlers.  Creating  a  custom  fit  curriculum  requires  observation,  engagement  with  families,  and  knowledge  of  child development. This knowledge guides how caregivers interact and respond. Caregivers read each child's cues and react in nurturing ways. They also consider individual characteristics, such as the child's age, abilities, needs, and interests, as well as temperament, home language, and family culture.\nThis page titled 32.2.1: Relationships and Curriculum is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda\nTaintor."

One of these individual differences is temperament. Temperament refers to behavioral \"styles\" that children are born with and describes how they approach and react to the world.[1] Temperament is crucial because it affects how infants and toddlers interpret and respond to the world around them. When planning and implementing curriculum for individual or groups of children, caregivers must consider the temperament of the infants and toddlers. When planning something messy or loud where a slow-to-warm child is present, how will the caregiver provide caring and respectful support structures that allow him to engage in the curriculum without feeling overwhelmed?\nFigure : Primary caregiving can help support sensory exploration for children with more reluctant temperaments.

    "context_enriched_content": "The Importance of Play\nScientists  who  study  how  infants  think  and  feel  often  describe  them  as  small  scientists:  like  their  adult  counterparts,  infants constantly experiment and investigate to figure things out. ((Gopnik, Kuhl, & Meltzoff, The scientist in the crib: Minds, brains, and how children learn, 1999)) Infants spend their days actively gathering and organizing information about what objects and people are like, and they do much of this discovery through play. According to Gopnik, Meltzoff, and Kuhl (2000), infants actively build knowledge as they interact with the world around them. They try a variety of ways to act on objects and materials and, in doing so, experiment with and build concepts and ideas.\nIn the early twentieth century, scientists and theorists-such as Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky-developed widely studied theories to explain how infants acquire knowledge. Their theories are commonly encountered in many other early childhood areas of study. [1]\nIn most of these theories, infants actively construct concepts and build skills by interacting with objects and people, often occurring in  the  context  of  play.  The  body  of  research  on  the  young  infant's  developing  mind  adds  to  our  understanding  of  teaching  and planning an infant's curriculum. Studies show infants are highly motivated to explore new materials and take on new challenges (Bowman, Donovan, and Burns 2000.) Moments often discounted as \"just play\" or as \"fiddling around\" are moments in which infants  are  actively  learning  (Hirsh-Pasek  et  al.  2009;  Jones  and  Reynolds  2011;  Zigler,  Singer,  and  Bishop-Josef  2004;  Elkind 2007.) While engaged in play, infants explore the physical properties of materials and the possibilities for action, transformation, or representation.[2] Capturing these moments of play through documentation and linking them to areas of development help other stakeholders understand the importance of play in development and as an integral part of curriculum.[3]\n- [1] How  Young  Children  Learn  -  What  Science  Reveals  is  shared  under  a  CC  BY  license  and  was  authored,  remixed,  and/or curated by Jennifer Paris, Kristin Beeve, & Clint Springer.\n- [2]  Early  Education  and  Support  Division,  California  Department  of  Education.

A  significant  amount  of  individualization  for  curriculum  occurs  during  routine  care. Routines  offer  caregivers  many  opportunities  to  observe  and  understand  each  child's  ways  and  preferences  and  support development. During routine care, infants and toddlers enjoy adults' undivided attention as the focus is on meeting children's needs and getting to know them. By taking advantage of these opportunities to build relationships with each infant and toddler, caregivers promote attachment and trust with the infants or toddlers in their care. These developmental milestones for trust and relationships are critical for children's sense of security and willingness to explore people and objects in their environment: a high level of trust is necessary for infants and toddlers to fully engage in the offered curriculum.[1]\n[1]  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Administration  for  Children  and  Families  ,  ECLKC  Early  Head TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PAPER NO. 16 INDIVIDUALIZING CARE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS - PART 1.

In fact, the environment is such an important  part  of  curriculum  that  Loris  Malaguzzi,  founder  of  the  municipal  preschools  in  Reggio  Emilia,  Italy,  defined  the environment  as  the  third  teacher.  (BIERMEIER,  2015)  Think  about  how  materials  are  arranged  within  each  area  of  a  space: displaying materials at infants' and toddlers' levels makes them easily accessible, supports independent exploration, and allows the caregiver to follow the children's lead as they create their own curriculum. It is helpful to provide a few types of the same materials so  that  several  children  can  play  without  taking  turns,  minimizing  conflict.  However,  it  is  essential  to  avoid  offering  too  many materials since a cluttered room can overwhelm children and create classroom management concerns as well. Regularly rotating materials  creates  a  balance  of  familiar  and  new  materials,  which  helps  infants  and  toddlers  maintain  interest  and  enjoy  age appropriate challenges.

    "context_enriched_content": "Experiences or Activities?\nResearch shows that \"much of how infants and toddlers learn best comes not from specific adult-directed lessons but from [adults] knowing how to maximize opportunities for each child to use natural learning inclinations.\" (Lally, 2000) These opportunities or experiences can be set up in a planned, purposeful way or occur in the moment as adults follow a child's lead and take advantage of teachable moments. These teachable moments will often happen during routine care, which is why routines form the core of many curricula in infant and toddler programs.\nExperiences for infants and toddlers share some common elements regardless of the type of care:\n- They focus on the way children relate to materials, adults, and each other.\n- They are based on each child's developmental level and interests.\n- They support children's development and learning in all domains.\nCaregivers will typically organize experiences around:\n- Stories and books\n- Toys and gross motor equipment\n- Creative arts such as music, movement, and art materials\n- Imitation and pretending\n- Sensory exploration (e.g., sand, water, tasting and preparing food)\n- Outdoor play and exploration\nCaregivers  may  offer  one-on-one  experiences  for  individual  children;  they  may  also  provide  experiences  for  a  small  group  of children, offering individualized attention and support during the group experience.\nThe  key  to  successful  experiences,  whether  planned  or  spontaneous,  one-on-one  or  with  a  small  group,  is  having  a  deep understanding and knowledge of each child and family. This knowledge makes experiences meaningful and relevant to the child's development and learning, and results from ongoing observations, assessment, and engaging with families.[1]\nPlanning and carrying out appropriate experiences for infants and toddlers can sometimes be challenging. Even when experiences are based on a child's interests, abilities, and needs, the child may not respond as expected. Caregivers may be unsure of what to do when this happens. Planning experiences means \"planning for possibilities.\" This idea is central to balancing planning with the flexibility necessary for successful infant and toddler care. Plans are helpful because they enable caregivers to stay organized and focused. However, infants and toddlers are unpredictable; caregivers often must modify an experience or abandon it and try it at a different time or on another day. It is more important to follow a child's lead than to stick to the planned experience. Additionally, a child's  family  may  not  be  comfortable  with  an  offered  experience  because  of  their  beliefs,  values,  or  life  situations.  Messy experiences, such as painting and playing with water or sand, and going outside (especially if it is windy or cold) are examples of experiences to which families may object.[1] Including families in the planning process and making them aware of the center's philosophy can be helpful in avoiding potential conflict.\n[1] U.S Department of Health and Human Services ECLKC Individualizing Care for Infants and Toddlers - Part 2 is in the public domain\nThis page titled 32.2.6: Curriculum as Experiences is shared under a mixed 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Amanda Taintor."

    "context_enriched_content": "How to Begin\nCreating a responsive, individualized curriculum starts with observing each child: watching and listening to discover how infants actively make sense of their everyday encounters with people and objects, documenting observations, and connecting with each child's  family to share information.[1] When caregivers intentionally observe and listen, infants and toddlers reveal clues about their thinking, feelings, or intentions. Infants' actions, gestures, and words illuminate what they are trying to figure out or how they make sense of people and objects' attributes, actions, and responses.[2] Through documentation, caregivers make visible the ways infants  and  toddlers  learn.  Planning  infant/toddler  curriculum  begins  with  caregivers  discovering,  through  careful  listening  and daily observation, each infant's interests, abilities, and needs.[3] Written observations of infant and toddler play and interactions reveal emerging skills and ideas. As caregivers observe, they discover ways to extend learning experiences to support the infant in building  more  complex,  coherent  ideas.  Caregivers'  reflections  of  an  individual  infant  lead  to  further  review  on  the  emerging interests, concepts, and skills of another infant in the small group.[3]\nAnecdotal  notes  or  photos  make  it  possible  to  reflect  on  infant  and  toddlers'  learning  experiences.  Documentation  supports caregivers in planning how to extend, expand, and add complexity to infants' learning through the curriculum offered.\nBy taking time to review and reflect on each infant's behavior, temperament, learning interests, developmental profile, and needs, caregivers deepen their understanding and appreciation of each infant. This reflection also gives caregivers ideas on supporting learning  and  development,  responding  to  infants'  interests,  expanding  on  their  ideas,  and  engaging  them  in  planning  learning experiences. (California Department of Education)\nGathering  artifacts  for  documentation,  including  samples  of  an  infant's  work  and  other  materials  involving  the  infant,  informs curriculum plans. For example, a caregiver notes an infant beginning to stand up with support and documents the behavior with a photo.\nThe caregiver, drawing on her knowledge of infant development, knows the next step in infant motor development will be cruising -moving  from  place  to  place  while  standing  and  holding  on  to  something  for  support.  As  a  result  of  the  caregiver's documentation, she knows to modify the environment to include supports on which the infant might pull up to a standing position to cruise around. When reflecting on documentation, the caregiver will note other children who could benefit from environmental modifications.  The  curriculum  for  the  infant  becomes  intentionally  designed  time  and  space  for  the  infant  to  engage  with  the environmental changes as their physical development unfolds. As caregivers observe, reflect, and document, they become more attentive  and  responsive  to  each  infant's  ongoing  development.  Caregivers  must  plan  experiences  that  support  infant/toddler learning and development in all domains and content areas.[3]\n- [1]  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Administration  for  Children  and  Families  ,  ECLKC  Early  Head TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PAPER NO. 16 INDIVIDUALIZING CARE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS - PART 1.

Through taking time to reflect on and interpret what the data means, caregivers develop a deeper understanding of individual developmental processes,  behavior,  temperament,  interests,  and  challenges.  This  process  of  reflection  and  interpretation  leads  caregivers  to conclusions that help them individualize planning.[2]"

Everyone's shared participation in creating learning experiences allows a dynamic exchange of information and ideas-from infant to  adult,  from  adult  to  infant,  from  adult  to  adult,  and  from  infant  to  infant.  The  perspective  of  each  (infant,  family,  caregiver) informs the other, and each learns from the other. Each relationship (infant with family, infant with caregiver, infant with infant, and family with the caregiver) is reciprocal. Each participant gives, receives and adds to the other's learning and understanding.[2]\nCaregivers must explain to families their principles of curriculum planning based on observation, documentation, interpretation, reflection,  planning,  and  implementation;  they  must  also  clarify  the  goals  and  features  of  the  curriculum  used  in  the  learning environment.  This  step  should  not  be  overlooked  or  skipped  in  the  curriculum  process.  Enlist  the  support  of  interpreters  or translators as needed. Additional ways to include families in the curriculum process:\n- Engage families in discussions about the role of observation, documentation, interpretation, and reflection in planning.\n- Synthesize information gathered through the observation process (including input from families) in planning for individual infants and the group, considering diverse cultural and linguistic experiences.\n- Solicit ideas from families to meet infant learning and developmental goals. These ideas should inform the planning of activities, experiences, interactions and selection of materials for indoor and outdoor spaces.\n- Share learning materials with families and explain how their infants learn as they engage with those materials and experiences. Include families in curriculum planning and implementation.\n- Share observations with families about their infants in an objective, timely, private, and confidential manner in the most comfortable language for them. Enlist the assistance of an interpreter or translator as needed. [3]\nPlans  also  present  opportunities  to  strengthen  relationships  between  programs  and  families  and  foster  families.  Through  the planning phase, caregivers can communicate and collaborate with parents. Plans are shared to provide information about changes and to strengthen relationships with families. Communication about planned curriculum experiences enhances parents' feelings of inclusion in the program and provides them with opportunities to communicate about their child. Parents may also be interested in watching for changes in their infant's behavior due to the program's adaptations. Sharing plans can be a way for caregivers and families to come together, enhancing their sense of partnership in the experience of watching an infant grow and develop.[3]"

There are different ways to support an infant who is beginning to figure out that objects and people exist even when she can't see them (object permanence) or a toddler who has discovered the joys of dumping and filling. Caregivers likely think about the indoor/outdoor environment and what  changes  they  might  make.  They  also  identify  potential  changes  to  interactions,  the  child's  schedule,  and  strategies  for engaging families. Families may have suggestions and preferences that reflect their daily home practices. Caregivers do not have to implement every idea at once!\nInfants and toddlers benefit from repetition, practice, and familiarity. \"Repeated exposure to familiar opportunities gives [infants and toddlers] the chance to make sense of their experiences and build [a] foundation that will support later learning.\" (Early Head Start National Resource Center and revised by the National Center on Early Childhood Development, Teaching, and Learning in collaboration with the Office of Head Start., 2018).\nFlexibility is a priority while planning curriculum: caregivers must respond to children's moment-to-moment interests and needs. Planning for infants and toddlers equates to planning for possibilities. As Linda Lloyd Jones says in her article \"Relationship as Curriculum,\" we should watch and observe our babies much more closely. What are they doing? How are they playing? What are\nthey trying to achieve? Ask them who they are, what they need, and how we can support them. Then listen and watch for the answer.\n- J. Ronald Lally suggested planning should:\n2. Include experiences that place the adult in the role of facilitating children's learning rather than directing learning.\n3. Assist the adult in reading each infant and toddler's cues.\n4. Prepare the caregiver, home visitor, and family childcare provider to communicate effectively with other adults in the child's life (Lally, 2000)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Writing it Down\nWhat form should be used when writing down curriculum possibilities? A quality planning form supports caregivers in connecting the dots between reflections/interpretations of information and observations and promoting development and learning strategies.\nWhether a caregiver creates plans for an individual child or a group, the process is similar.  Caregivers  review  the  information gathered  for  each  child,  note  any  common  interests,  abilities,  and  needs,  then  decide  what  changes  to  make,  exceptional experiences to offer, and ways to engage families. Even within group plans, caregivers should consider how to individualize the plan for each child. For example, a fingerplay song can be planned to meet receptive language interests for one child, a fine motor exploration for another child, and an adult-child interaction (social/emotional) interest for a third child.\nReviewing individual child or group planning forms from the previous weeks and the documentation created during those activities is  also  helpful  for  planning  purposes.  Depending  on  how  each  child  or  group  of  children  respond,  caregivers  may  or  may  not change the current week's plans. If children enjoy exploring pom-poms and containers on a water table, caregivers may decide not to change the experience. If, upon reflection of the documentation, infants and toddlers appear interested in picking up the pom poms, caregivers may choose to add spoons and tongs to extend the experience.\nPlanning based on observations, input from families, ongoing assessment, and knowledge of infant/toddler development is key to creating developmentally age-appropriate experiences. It is easy to choose experiences that, while possibly appropriate for older children, are not suitable for younger ones. Experiences that require a child to be in a group without leaving if she loses interest or requires sitting still for long periods are also inappropriate. A high-quality, developmentally sensitive curriculum should provide suggestions  for  selecting  appropriate  experiences,  materials,  and  equipment,  facilitating  the  experiences,  and  creating  safe  and interesting environments for infants and toddlers to explore.[1]\n[1]  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  Administration  for  Children  and  Families  ,  ECLKC  Early  Head TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PAPER NO. 16 INDIVIDUALIZING CARE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS - PART 1.

    "context_enriched_content": "Ready, Set, ....Go!\nOnce observation takes place and experiences are documented, caregivers implement plans by making changes in the environment and  introducing  materials  (California  Department  of  Education).  Each  infant's  unique  thoughts,  feelings,  needs,  interests,  and reactions influence curriculum implementation. \"When experiences are planned and tailored to the developmental needs of infants and toddlers, they become engaged, active learners.\" Plans can be brief and flexible as responsiveness to the infant's moment-tomoment interests and needs applies to every part of the curriculum planning process. Caregivers should consistently demonstrate cultural  sensitivity  in  formal  and  informal  interactions  when  implementing  curriculum.  Including  families  in  the  curriculum planning process and engaging in open dialogue through the implementation process helps ensure greater cultural sensitivity.\nImplementing curriculum plans may involve a new way to interact with a child (or family member to support the child), a change in the schedule or physical environment, a different approach to routine care, a new material, or a new experience. It may also involve  doing  the  same  things  as  before.  Either  way,  allow  the  infant  to  make  choices  and  interact  freely  with  materials  and equipment,  the  setup  of  the  indoor  and  outdoor  environment,  the  experience  or  routine,  and  with  the  caregivers  (or  family members) themselves.[1] The child's response (or lack of response) influences how implementation occurs; the implementation process  is  not  an  endpoint  in  the  curriculum  planning  process.  Once  a  possibility  or  experience  is  introduced,  the  caregiver observes and responds to the individual infant's ongoing engagement in the experience. Just as a caregiver must do when planning and  creating  a  curriculum,  implementation  includes  observation,  reflection,  documentation,  and  interpretation.  A  key  piece  of implementation is observing what the child does and following the child's lead. In this way, caregivers \"create with the child a learning experience that is personally meaningful and responsive, moment by moment.\"[1] In group care settings with infants and toddlers, expecting all children to do the same things simultaneously is not the best practice for individualized care. Allow infants and toddlers to engage with the experience independently and freely come and go as needed. Infants or toddlers should never be prohibited from leaving the experience or from choosing not to engage in an experience. Once an experience with an infant or small group begins, caregivers adapt their plans and actions to the changing needs and interests of the infants.\nImplementing  curriculum  plans  may  produce  surprising  or  unexpected  results,  which  offers  caregivers  new  insights  and opportunities to refine their understanding of each child and family. Implement plans \"in the spirit of experimentation: Each time a plan works or does not work, [caregivers] can learn and grow from the experience.\"[1] Adaptation and change are critical parts of the learning processes for both infant and caregiver.\nCreating and implementing infant experiences or curriculum allows a caregiver to experiment and learn more about the infant and oneself as a caregiver.\nLet's look at a scenario of observation and implementation of curriculum.\nOver several days, a caregiver might observe a small group of older toddlers fascinated with pretend play. Through reflection on observations and documentation of the toddlers' emerging interests, the caregiver may place additional puppets in the environment. The caregiver may wonder whether the puppets would motivate the toddlers to build interest in pretend play. Rather than drawing attention to the puppets, the caregiver may simply decide to place the puppets in the dramatic play area in the room. The caregiver can add some gardening-related props to the outside play area. Curious about what the toddlers will do with the new play materials, the caregiver waits to see what happens next. Anything could happen: the toddlers may not be interested in the latest materials, or they may begin to engage in lively pretend play that suggests new possibilities to the caregiver.\nThe above example of supporting older toddlers' pretend play is one of countless possible ideas caregivers may try as part of a reflective,  responsive  approach  to  curriculum.  In  addition  to  modifying  the  environment  and  introducing  equipment  and  play materials, caregivers adapt their interactions with toddlers based on what they discover through observation, documentation, and reflection."

With  insights  about  the infant's ongoing development, the caregiver may step back when the infant moves out into the environment. When relating to the infants from a distance, the caregiver may discover that one infant enjoys making contact, while another infant may need to stay close  and  often  seeks  physical  contact.  The  same  caregiver  may  observe  that  some  infants  have  an  emerging  interest  in  joint attention or looking at things together with the caregiver. As a result, the caregiver may look at books more frequently, with the infant looking at an adult. When sharing books with the infant, the caregiver may notice that 2 of the infants spend a long time looking at each picture, while another infant prefers to turn the pages quickly. Although implementing an interaction strategy to\nsupport infants' learning may start the same way, each infant's path with the new possibility will require the caregiver to adapt. For a strategy or plan based on prior observation, documentation, and reflection to be effective, the caregiver must follow each infant's lead and create a learning experience that is personally meaningful and responsive moment by moment.[1]\nTo  sum  up  planning  and  implementing  as  they  relate  to  individualizing,  consider  the  following  (adapted  from  the  California Infant/Toddler Curriculum Framework). Planning for individualized care practices should reflect:\n- The abilities that infants and toddlers bring to each interaction\n- Each child's need for relationship-based experiences\n- Family input and preferences\n- An understanding of and appreciation for each child within the context of the child's family and culture\nImplementing individualized care practices should focus on facilitating learning and enable caregivers to:\n- Enhance their connections and engagement with each child's family.\n- Maximize each child's sense of security and attachment.\n- Learn to read the cues of each infant and toddler and respond appropriately.\n- Encourage and support each child's interests and explorations.\n- Address the child's whole learning experience, including creating a safe and exciting place for learning.\n- Support children's progress toward individual child goals and allow for unique variations in temperament, approach, and pace.\n[1]  Early  Learning  and  Care  Division,  California  Department  of  Education.

They ask questions such as \"How did it go?\" \"What worked well and why?\" \"What didn't work and why?\" and \"What changes could be made?\" They may ask themselves these questions in the middle of trying a new experience or later as they reflect on and evaluate the day or week. The answers to questions like these must be fed back into the cycle of individualization as caregivers continue to observe, document, reflect, interpret, plan, and implement.\nBecoming skilled in these activities means caregivers:\n- Become better prepared to understand each infant and toddler's developmental stage.\n- Show thoughtfulness about how to offer support to further each child's development and learning.\n- Demonstrate through actions that they understand the critical role positive adult-child relationships play in how infants and toddlers develop.\n- Support the family's role as their child's first and most important caregiver.\n- Know the value of families' input and actively seek it out.\n- Evaluate the effectiveness of what they implement by continually observing, reflecting, communicating with families, and refining their plan.\nAs  caregivers  become  more  purposeful  in  their  individualization  practices,  they  see  more  and  more  opportunities  to  plan  for possibilities and learning opportunities that nurture each infant, toddler, and family.
