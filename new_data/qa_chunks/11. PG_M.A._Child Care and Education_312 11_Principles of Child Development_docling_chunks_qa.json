During this process a child progresses from dependency on their parents/guardians to increasing independence. Child development is strongly influenced by genetic factors (genes passed on from their parents) and events during prenatal life. It is also influenced by environmental facts and the child's learning capacity.\nAll children have varying physical and emotional needs, depending on their age, personality, and developmental stage. As a child matures, they will go through phases where they explore their environment, learn verbal and reasoning skills, socialize with others, assert their independence from their family, etc. The various aspects of child development include the various stages  of  child  development,  the  development  of  motor  skills,  language development and socio-emotional development.\nThis book, Principles of Child Development is  divided  into  fifteen units that follow the self-instruction mode with each unit beginning with an Introduction to the unit, followed by an outline of the Objectives. The detailed content is then presented in a simple but structured manner interspersed with Check Your Progress Questions to test the student's understanding of the topic. A Summary along with a list of Key Words and a set of SelfAssessment Questions and Exercises is also provided at the end of each unit for recapitulation."

On the other hand, development is defined as the overall growth of humans throughout their life  course.  Development is a process in which human beings change in terms of intellectual, physical, emotional and social aspects of growth.\nThe stages of development are primarily divided into two categories, namely, infancy and childhood. In the stage of infancy, the child becomes aware of the physical stages of growth during the first five years of life. In the stage of adolescence, children go through various changes such as emotional, physical and social. Psychologists study human growth which includes aspects such as physical, social, cognitive, intellectual, perceptual and emotional growth.\nIn this unit, the meaning of growth and development has been discussed. The unit will also explain the stages of infancy and childhood. The areas of development and the principles of growth and development have also been highlighted in this unit.\nNOTES"

    "context_enriched_content": "1.2 MEANING OF GROWTH\nGrowth and development have been interchangeably used by most of the developmental psychologists because both the processes are interrelated and interdependent on each other. It is difficult to differentiate the contribution of either of them in the development of the personality of an individual. However, some psychologists define growth as an indicative of increase in bodily dimensions; height and weight which are generally confined to quantitative changes. Arnold Lucius Gessell, an American child psychologist, wrote,\n.  .  .  Growth is a function of the organism rather than of the environment as such: The environment furnishes the foil and the milieu for the manifestations of development, but these manifestations come from inner compulsion and are primarily organized by inherent inner mechanics and by an intrinsic physiology of development. The very plasticity of growth requires that there be limiting and regulatory mechanisms. Growth is a process so intricate and so sensitive that there must be powerful stabilizing factors, intrinsic rather than extrinsic, which preserve the balance of the total pattern and direction of the growth trend. Maturation is, in a sense, a name for this regulatory mechanism.\nDevelopment has been defined in a number of ways. Let us now look at some of the definitions of development given by renowned psychologists.\nDevelopment can be defined as the emerging and expanding of capacities of the individual to provide greater facility in functioning, such as development of motor ability from uncertain steps to proficiency in games. Development as a matter of fact is achieved through growth.\nDevelopment refers  to  interactions  of  a  person  and  his  or  her environmental surroundings whose after-products alter existing response tendencies  in  such  a  way  as  to  increase:  their  strength,  the  degree  of differentiation, and the organisation of personality.\nDevelopment refers to those effects upon the person's cognitiveemotional systems which strengthen or enlarge one or more of them, increase\ntheir number or interrelate them in some different way. In brief, development is confined to qualitative changes in the organism.\nThe process of development has been explained from different points of view.\nSome of them are as follows:\n1.   Development as maturation: According to the famous child psychologist, Arnold Gessell, the role of physical changes is important in the process of development. The development from infancy to adolescence is governed by physical changes that are mapped out in the individual's genes. For instance, a growing nervous system changes systematically and automatically and this  results  in  predictable  changes  in  bones  and  muscles.  He used the term, 'maturation' to describe growth processes that are governed by such automatic and genetically determined signals. He believed that most of the major changes in the organism are based on maturation.\n2.   Development as learning: Donald M. Baer, a child psychologist and researcher has defined development as 'behaviour change which requires programming; and programming requires time, but not enough of it to call it age.' Programming refers here to sequences of learning which may happen naturally or may be arranged in the life of an individual. Development, in this view, is a collection of learning experiences which the child acquires in the process of interaction with his environment.\n3.   Development as synthesis: A Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget says,  'For  some  psychologists  development  is  reduced  to  a series of specific learned items and development is thus the sum . . . of this series of specific items . . . In reality development is the essential process, and each element of learning occurs as a function of total development rather than being an element which explains development.' According to Piaget, there are four basic elements in development, which are as follows: (i) Maturation; (ii) Experience; (iii) Social transmission (learning through language, schooling or training by parents); (iv) Equilibration."

    "context_enriched_content": "Distinction between Growth, Development and Maturation\nGrowth refers to a process of becoming larger or longer or more numerous or more important, largely a physical change. Development, on the other hand, is a process in which something (mostly positive) transforms into a different stage or improves. Growth and development are two words in the English language that can be used with some difference, although they appear to have the same connotation. Growth is taken to mean an increase in the size\nNOTES"

Maturation, on the other hand, is naturally occurring change that is genetically controlled. Some developmental changes are considered maturational, or indicators of physical maturity. Maturation is the progression of developmental changes toward the characteristics of adults. Physical maturation occurs from the time of conception, but some of the most commonly recognized indicators of maturation become apparent during adolescence. Changes in body shape, breast development in girls, and pubic hair development in both genders and development of facial hair in boys are visible indicators of maturation toward adult appearance of the body. The cessation of the growth of long bones, associated with the final attainment of adult stature is also a maturational event.\nAlthough growth and maturation are certainly related,  however, distinguishing  between  them  is  important  because  some  physiological and hormonal processes affect growth and maturation differentially, as do some diseases. It is easy to observe that children of the same size can differ in maturational status and that fully mature individuals (adults) can be of different sizes."

The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioural traits from 'nurture' is known as tabula rasa ('blank slate'). This question was once considered to be an appropriate division of developmental influences, but since both types of factors are known to play such interacting roles in development, many modern psychologists consider the question naive-representing an outdated state of knowledge.\nIn the social and political sciences, the nature versus nurture debate may be contrasted with the structure versus agency debate (i.e., socialization versus individual autonomy)."

Over the course of two years, they progress to the point where they have recognizable personalities; are able to move themselves from place to place; and understand how certain important aspects of the world operate (such as object permanence; the understanding that objects continue to exist even when you are not looking at them). They understand the basics of how to make their wishes known, have formed attachments and relationships, and have learned basic ways of managing their emotions and impulses."

The child begins to assume the body proportions of an adult. The growth in legs is rapid and the legs represent about half of one's total height. The head growth is slow and trunk growth is intermediate. Generally, the weight of a three-year-old male child is about 33 pounds\nNOTES"

By the age of five years, the average height for boys is 43 inches and the average weight is 43 pounds. The height and weight are affected by a number of variables, such as height of parents, nutrition and illness.\nIn addition to size and weight, the child undergoes other physical and physiological changes. The muscles develop at a very rapid speed. Larger muscles are far better developed than the smaller and finer ones. Physiological changes occur in respiration, heart rate slows down and blood pressure goes up steadily. Brain has developed 90 per cent of its adult weight. Nerve fibres in the brain areas come close to maturity level by the end of pre-school period.\n- Perceptual development: The child in early childhood develops a variety of motor skills which are repeated. Self-feeding, self-dressing, bathing, brushing the hair, playing with toys, using pencils, jumping and hopping develops at the age of 5 to 6 years.\nThe  perceptual  development  begins  from  mass  movements  to differentiation and integration. Table 1.1 lists the norms for children from 2 years to 5 years of age.\nTable 1.1 Developmental Norms (Bulher, GessellTerman)\n\nDevelopment, 2 years = Walks without help, jumps, runs.. Development, 3 years = Skips, hops. Development, 4 and 5 years = Free and active movement, responds to music.. Fine motor coordination, 2 years = Copying.. Fine motor coordination, 3 years = Can match shapes, sees similarities and differences. Fine motor coordination, 4 and 5 years = Can name colours.. Perceptual, 2 years = Identifies self, matches colours.. Perceptual, 3 years = Can fit nets, boxes.. Perceptual, 4 and 5 years = Matches shapes and colours, distinguishes names.. Vocalization, 2 years = 200 words, uses few words.. Vocalization, 3 years = 900 words, follows commands.. Vocalization, 4 and 5 years = Can repeat 4 digits-2000 to 3000 words, can define familiar words.. Adaptive behaviour, 2 years = Bowel control.. Adaptive behaviour, 3 years = Builds blocks, can draw a man.. Adaptive behaviour, 4 and 5 years = 4 digits, draws body with details.\n- Language development :  The  language  development of the infant begins from birth cry. The ten-month-old child is able to use one word but by the end of the first year, his or her vocabulary increases to 3 or 4 words. Good home environment and early childhood training help in the development of vocabulary. It has been reported by several studies that there is positive correlation between intelligence and language development.\n- Intellectual development: The intellectual development of the child is accelerated after the age of two because now he or she begins to explore his or her social environment and acquires new experiences.\n- The following are the major characteristics of intellectual development:\n- a)  Child begins to form concepts of physical and social reality; by the age of six the child develops perception of size, shape, colour, time and distance; Memory increases at a very rapid speed. The child can learn by rote memorization; Creativity develops in children and imagination begins to grow; Thinking and reasoning develops in relation to concrete material; Span of attention increases from seven minutes to twenty minutes and interest in exploring the environment increases; The child is now able to use symbols in language, draw symbolic play and engage in problem solving; The child asks questions about his or her environment.\n- Social development: A child is born in a social environment where his or her personality development is shaped in accordance with the norm of the society:\nSense of trust and mistrust develops in children themselves and their environment; Feeling of autonomy develops in children. They begin to  explore  their  environment  independently;  Social  environment expands beyond home; Children of both sexes play together without any  discrimination. They  actively  participate  in  group  games  in which physical energy is used such as hide and seek; They learn to cooperate with others and make friends on shared interests and similar personality traits; Children take interest in fairy tales and animal stories; Negativism increases between the years three to six. It is a product of social situations. It is said that the more the child is frustrated by adult interference, the more negativistic his or her behaviour will be; Girls are more dominating than boys in play situations; The child seeks social approval of his or her action."

In adolescence, marked physical changes take place which have significant behavioural implications.\nPhysical features in adolescence may be discussed under the following heads:\n- Change in height: Almost all boys and girls show a spurt in growth during  adolescence  which  is  preceded  and  followed  by  years  of comparatively little increase. There is a sudden shoot-up in growth in height. There are sex differences in height and weight. In infancy boys surpass girls. At the age of 13, girls are taller and heavier than boys but by the age of 15 boys are taller and heavier than girls.\n- Changes in bodily proportion: There  is  general  change  in  the proportions of various bodily parts. The different parts of the body grow at different rates and attain their maximum development at different times. The pelvis bone of girls broadens and their wrist becomes circular. The arms and legs grow in length and become finer. Boys develop round shoulders.\n- Voice: Change of voice in boys is a commonly recognized feature of adolescent development.

The change of voice, sometimes, has notable effects on the behaviour of adolescents.\n- Secondary sex characteristics: The secondary sex characteristics develop during adolescence. Genital organs in boys grow in size. Testes usually grow earlier. In girls, sex organs acquire maturity. The growth of breasts and the widening of the pelvis in girls are among the physical development that has significant influence on the adolescent girls' conception of her physical self.\n- Hair growth: Change in hair growth is associated with puberty. In case of boys, hair appears on upper limbs and beard; pubic hair and hair in armpits appear in both boys and girls.\n- Physiological changes: All  internal  systems  such  as  respiratory, circulatory, digestive, blood pressure, heart and pulse-rate acquire their full growth. Brain is fully developed by the age of 18.\n- The age of menstruation: The data on menarche has been collected in all parts of the world. It is generally believed that girls in tropical and sub-tropical countries mature earlier than cold countries. The average age of menstruation varies from 13 to 16 years.\n- Relationship between physical and mental growth: It  has  been shown that the interests and behaviour patterns of children are closely allied with their pattern of physical and physiological development. Physical development has a psychological effect on his or her attitudes regarding himself or herself and on the attitudes of others toward him or her. The physical development is an important factor in social development and approval. If the girl is ugly and under-developed, she tries to avoid social situations. If the boy is physically handicapped or has some minor physical defects then definitely his intellectual and social developments are affected.\n- Physical activity  and  ability: The  capacity  to  perform  physical activities increases rapidly in adolescence.\n- Changes in strength speed: There is a great increase in muscular strength in adolescence. The adolescents become more active in their work. Girls seem to mature earlier than boys in physical activity.\n- Growth trend in motor performance: Psychologist, Espenschade conducted a study on boys and girls for a number of years on tests on running, throwing a ball and jumping. There was great difference in the performance of boys and girls. Boys are better. The boys are superior, particularly in activities which involve speed and muscular strength. Boys continue their interest in physical activities while there is sharp decrease in the interest of girls. There is a sharp increase in jumping\nand throwing events from 13 to 16 years. Many of the sex differences in motor and mechanical activities are not due to a genuine sex difference as to a difference in amount of interest, experience and practice.\nThere is a close relationship between motor performance and other traits. Popularity in adolescence is closely related to physical strength and skill in athletic activities than to intelligence and school achievement. The cluster of physical traits as physical skills, bravery and strength show a high relationship in social situation and heterosexual relations. These findings emphasize the importance of physical education and recreational activities for adolescents. The boys who have poor athletic abilities have poor social adjustment. They develop tension and conflict arising from inferiority."

Mental development during adolescence accelerates on many intellectual fronts. The following are the characteristics of mental development in adolescence:\n- Increased ability to generalize the facts: Children usually generalize in  relation  to  concrete  objects.  The  intellectual  development  in childhood operates on a perceptual level but in adolescence the ability to generalize on conceptual level develops. The adolescent can generalize in an abstract way.\n- Increased ability to understand: There is an increase in the ability to see relationship and to solve problems of increasing complexity and difficulty. His or her depth of understanding develops.\n- Increased ability to deal with abstraction: The  adolescents  can think not only in general terms but also in abstract terms to a greater degree than children. They can think in terms of symbols rather than concrete things. Ability to carry on abstract thinking is not something that suddenly develops in adolescence. It is relative. This ability to comprehend and to communicate meanings in abstract qualitative concepts is an important aspect of intellectual maturity in adolescents.\n- Development of memory and imagination: The  memory  in adolescence develops tremendously with the growth in vocabulary. The adolescents can imagine about a situation which is not physically present before them. Their long-term memory increases. They can retain facts for a longer period. They can anticipate future needs and can plan for it.\n- Growth away from trial and error method: Trial and error is the primitive method to solve problems.

Decision-making ability is necessary for successful adjustment in life. During adolescence, we expect the growing child to gain increasing confidence in his or her own opinion. There is  a  certain  amount  of  independence  in  thinking,  a  certain freedom in exploring and in weighing alternatives that is involved in the kind of maturity that enables one to make decisions on his or her own.\n- Understanding of moral concepts: The child, without questioning the validity of moral training, obeys the moral code framed by parents, but as he or she enters adolescence he or she critically examines the moral code and asks a number of questions.\n- Self-criticism and evaluation: Adolescents begin to evaluate their performance objectively but majority of adolescents do not achieve the mental maturity to do so. They either overestimate or under evaluate their performance.\n- Increased rational self-control: Adolescents show more intellectual maturity to do a thing. They achieve rational self-control which is promoted by good mastery of developmental tasks which develops the sense of achievement and duty in them."

If there had been no emotion in life of the organism, life would have been without any aspiration. In absence of emotions, social and family life would have ceased and progress would have been checked. The word emotion has been derived from the Latin word 'emovere' which means 'to move out'. Emotion may be defined as the stirred up condition of the organism involving internal and external changes in the body. It is expressed in love, fear, anger, laughter and tears. It involves feelings of jubilation or depression and impulse to action and awareness of perception.\nBasically, human beings are creatures of feelings or emotions. Our emotions control our behaviour. Emotion in the organism is a dynamic internal adjustment that operates for the satisfaction and welfare of the individual. Adolescence is marked by heightened emotionality."

They feel a kind of inner freedom-freedom to feel and experience in an intimate personal way.\n- Capacity of sharing emotions: In childhood, children are not able to control their emotions. Sharing of emotional experiences reaches its fullest development when an adolescent is able to relate himself or herself to another person in such a way that the satisfaction of the person is just as important as his or her own. It means he or she begins to love his or her neighbours as much as himself or herself.\n- Expansion of Loyalties: Emotional development begins from the home environment of the infant and during adolescence it is expanded beyond home and neighbourhood. These loyalties are identified with peers and leaders of various fields.\n- Realism in emotional experiences: Now the child enters the period of reality. An adolescent can perceive and appreciate people around him or her. He or she recognizes the weakness and strength of one's character.\n- Reviewing of hopes and aspirations: Adolescence is the period of life when one has high hopes and aspirations for his future life. Some adolescents work realistically to achieve their expectations and others do little to realize their hopes; they remain in illusion, and in the world of day-dreams and flights of fancy which make them unrealistic.\n- Toleration  of  aloneness: The  adolescents  develop  a  feeling  of loneliness. Sometimes they like to be alone in their home.\n- Externalization of feelings: The adolescent learns to externalize his or her feelings in the various situations of external environment he or she moves in. He or she can project his or her feelings on others.\n- Increased compassion: Compassion means fellowship of feeling. It denotes an ability to enter into kinship with the feelings and impulses involved in any sort of emotional experience, whether it is joy or sorrow. To be compassionate means that a person is able to enter his or her own feelings and appreciate the emotional feelings of others."

Morality is indissolubly linked with the social system. The child has to learn what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong. He or she has also to learn his or her duty. All these terms imply clearly that morality has reference to social relationship and social process. Morality has two dimensions which are closely interlinked.

Development is a product of the interaction: Development is a process resultant from a constant flux or interchange of energy within an organism and his or her environment. Hereditary forces inherent in the genetic constitution of the individual and environmental forces influence the development of the organism. It is very difficult to distinguish the contribution either of the two forces. An individual is a by-product of the constant interaction of the individual with his environment.\n2.  Development follows an orderly sequence: Individuals differ in rate of growth and development. However, development follows an orderly sequence in all individuals and shows high degree of similarity in the order in which various developments appear. Psychologists have reported several directional trends in the development. Following are the main trends:\n2. ( i ) Cephalo caudal: Development starts from head and proceeds towards heel.\n3. ( ii ) Proximodigital: Development starts from the centre line of the body to the outer parts, more distant, from it.\n4. ( iii ) Locomotion: Locomotion develops in a sequence in all infants of different cultures of the world. The sequence is creeping, crawling and walking.\n3.  Development is a continuous process: Development begins from the  time  of  conception  in  the  womb  of  the  mother  and  continues till  maturity.  But  it  should  be  kept  into  consideration  that  it  is  not always smooth and gradual. There are spurts in physical growth and psychological functioning as increase in height and weight, sharp rise in  vocabulary during pre-school years and sudden improvement in problem-solving abilities during adolescence.\n4.  Bilateral to unilateral trend: The new-born infant is essentially a symmetrical organism anatomically, physiologically and functionally. This functional symmetry is revealed in the early motor development. The infants up to the age of 2.5 years use both the hands with equal ease. The hand preference starts after the age of two-and-a-half year.\n5.  Different aspects of development are interrelated: Different aspects of development are interrelated and interdependent. A child's early social behaviour is interrelated with his or her physical development. If the child is physically handicapped, then his social behaviour will be retarded. The motor development of walking has positive effect on the intellectual development of children. Thus, we see that different types of developments are interdependent and help each other.\n6.  Development is an individualized process: All individuals develop in their own way. Each child has his own rate of physical, mental, emotional and social development. If we observe six-year old children, we find great differences in their height weight and social, emotional and learning readiness. Even at different ages, children have different rates of development. The rate of growth is very high in infancy and then it slows down and continues throughout one's life. Growth may occur by fits and starts, meaning thereby that the rate of growth changes at different stages of a child's development.\nOverview of Growth and Development\nNOTES\nOverview of Growth and Development"

Each change is the culmination of his or her prior growth and experience.\n8.  Development proceeds from the general to the specific: In all types of  developments, we find the principle of mass differentiation and integration. The world at the time of birth is a big buzzing, blooming confusion for the child. Out of mass and undifferentiated behaviour emerge more differentiated, refined behaviour and goal-directed response. We can take any development and find that this principle applies. For example, language development of the child begins from the birth cry, as mass response. Out of this mass response, differentiation starts and gradually, the child acquire vocabulary of many words and consequently the skill of communication develops.\n9.  Rate of development differs in male and female children: There is a difference in the growth rate of boys and girls. Girls mature earlier in comparison to boys. Girls are taller and heavier than boys during pre-adolescence but by the end of adolescence boys surpass them."

Programming refers here to sequences of learning which may happen naturally or may be arranged in the life of an individual.\n2.  Development is experiential change. It is orderly, adaptive and durable changes that occur throughout our life. Maturation, on the other hand, is naturally occurring change that is genetically controlled.\n3.  The  four  basic  elements  of  development  are  (i)  Maturation;  (ii) Experience; (iii)  Social  transmission  (learning  through  language, schooling or training by parents); (iv) Equilibration.\n4.  The following are the main characteristics of emotions:\n5. (a)  Emotions are frequent.\n- (b)  They are expressed in relation to the concrete objects.\n- (c)  They  are  temporary.  It  means  that  the  child  shifts  his  or  her emotions very rapidly. For instance, a child of 3 years who is weeping, if given a toffee, will become happy.\n- (d)  Emotional expressions in early childhood are intense irrespective of the intensity of the stimulus.\n5.  Emotions change in strength. Emotions which were very strong at a certain age become weak as the child grows while others which were weak become stronger. This change may be due to change in drive strength, child's intellectual development and changes in interests and values.\n6.  The  factors  responsible  for  causing  increase  in  emotionality  are  as follows:\n- (a)  Change of roles in home, school and society\n- (b)  Unfavourable relations in home\n- (c)  Social expectations\n- (d)  Difficulty in adjustment to the member of opposite sex\n- (e)  Religious conflicts\n- (f)  School failures\n7.

It is orderly, adaptive and durable changes that occur throughout our life.\n- Maturation is the progression of developmental changes toward the characteristics of adults.\n- Although growth and maturation are certainly related,  however, distinguishing between them is important because some physiological and hormonal processes affect growth and maturation differentially, as do some diseases.\n- The nature versus nurture debate concerns the relative importance of an individual's innate qualities versus personal experiences in determining or causing individual differences in physical and behavioural traits.\n- Infancy is a time of intense development. Babies start out with little more than instinctual reflexes and an innate ability to learn.\n- Growth in physical dimension during the period of 2 to 6 years of age is not as accelerated as that experienced in infancy.\n- The intellectual  development of the child is  accelerated  after  the age of two because now he or she begins to explore his or her social environment and acquires new experiences.\n- Emotions play an important role in life and contribute in the personal and social adjustment of the individual, however, provided that they are directed into wholesome expression.\n- The process of socialization confines to home and neighbourhood environment in early childhood but as the child enters school his or her social circle widens.\n- There is a close relationship between motor performance and other traits. Popularity in adolescence is closely related to physical strength and skill in athletic activities than to intelligence and school achievement.\n- The ability to solve problems increases in adolescence.

It combines the patterns of the development from infancy, childhood, and adolescence to adulthood. It is a process of growth from an infant to an adult. The process of development begins from the womb of the mother.\nGrowth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and  other  factors.  Development  and  growth  continue  throughout  life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to senility, and are referred to as the process of ageing. It is a social and natural process which includes both qualitative and quantitative changes. It is affected by both heredity and environmental factors. It can be measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms of measurement.\nIn this unit, the importance of development, its main areas and the methods related to the process of development have been discussed.

These areas are discussed in the following section.\n- Cognitive Development: Cognitive development is the child's ability to learn and solve problems.\n- Social  and  Emotional  Development: Social  and  emotional development is the child's ability to interact with others, which includes being able to help themselves and self-control.\n- Language Development: Language development is the child's ability to both understand and use language.\n- Fine Motor Skill Development: Fine motor skill development is the child's ability to use small muscles, specifically their hands and fingers, to pick up small objects, hold a spoon, turn pages in a book, or use a crayon to draw.\n- Gross Motor Skill Development: Gross motor skill development is the child's ability to use large muscles.\nThe teaching learning environment is designed in keeping in mind the basic features of life learner centred education and provision of holistic development of the learners. It is the primary responsibility of the teacher to  have  a  complete  knowledge about the development of the learners. It facilitates the process of finding about various aspects of development such as cognitive development, social and emotional development, fine and gross motor skills, and speech and language development.\nWe will in the following section, discuss the importance of study of development. These are enlisted as follows:\n1.  Attainment of knowledge of major aspects of development: It facilitates  gaining  of  knowledge  of  developmental  milestones  of\ndifferent age groups and in facilitation of designing of teaching learning environment for them for best learning outcome.\n2. Comprehension of the early learning process: It creates an appropriate learning environment and helps in development of appropriate teaching learning material help young child love learning.\n3. Incorporate relationship-building skills: It is a unique opportunity to learn about the important relationships between parents and educational professionals, as well as the relationships between educators and other community leaders.\n4. Provide a hands-on learning experience: Teachers will be able to use other resources such as blocks, toys, sand, and water to help the learners for developing the concepts of shape, texture, colors, numbers, and elements.\n5. Preparation for acknowledgment of individual differences: The knowledge of developmental aspects facilitates in acknowledgement of the fact that there is a wide pool of individual differences among learners which requires attention while planning for teaching learning experiences.\n6. Providing direction to general pattern of development : It helps in identification of gaps in development process and takes remedial steps for the same.\n7. Progress  towards  harmonious  development of  the  learners: Principle  of  correlation  among  various  aspects  of  development facilitates in harmonious growth and development of the learner."

Heredity refers to traits and features that are inherited from one's parents and their previous generations through the chromosomes found in the DNA. These control physical traits such as height, skin, hair and eye colour, and susceptibility to some medical conditions, as well as a great many other individual mental, physical and psychological traits.

These factors are discussed as follows:\n- Genetic Interactions: Genes sometimes contain conflicting information and prominently the dominant gene is expressed. Some genes act in an additive way. For example, if a child has one tall parent and one short parent, the child may end up splitting the difference by being of average height. In other cases, some genes follow a dominant-recessive pattern. Eye colour is one example of dominant-recessive genes at work. The gene for brown eyes is dominant and the gene for blue eyes is recessive.\n- Gene-Environment Interactions: The environment to which a child is exposed to both in womb of the mother and throughout the rest of their life can also impact how genes are expressed. For example, exposure to harmful drugs while in utero can have a dramatic impact on later child\ndevelopment. Height is a good example of a genetic trait that can be influenced by environmental factors. While a child›s genetic code may provide instructions for tallness, the expression of this height might be suppressed if the child has poor nutrition or a chronic illness."

Nurturing refers to an organism's environmental experiences that include parenting styles and physical surroundings social conditions. The interaction of nature and nurture influences every aspect of mind and behaviour to a degree. Neither of the two factors operates alone (Sylvia S Mader, 2003). Heredity and environment operate together to produce temperament, height, weight, ability to pitch a baseball, reading ability and so on.\nAccording to a professor of psychology, William Greenough (2001) the interaction of heredity and environment is so extensive that to ask, which is more important-nature or nurture-is like asking which is more important to a rectangle, height or width. People who are more successful at constructing optimal life experiences then others are the ones who looked for and found meaningful life theme as they developed. Their lives were not restricted to simple biological survival and passive acceptance of environmental dictates. Psychologists agreed that much complex behaviours have some genetic loading that makes people likely to develop in a particular way. However, our actual development also depends on what one experiences in our environment (J Gottlieb, 2004). The influence of the environment ranges from the things that are lumped together under nurture (like peer relations, family dynamics, neighbourhood quality, parenting and schooling) to biological encounters (like cellular activities, complications in birth, and viruses).\nSome psychologists, however, believe that one can develop beyond what our genetic inheritance and our environment give us. They argue that a key aspect of development involves seeking optimal experiences in life (M Massimini and A DelleFave, 2000). They cite examples of people who go beyond simple biological adaptation to actively choose from the environment the things that serve their purposes. These individuals build and construct their own lives, authoring a unique developmental path.\nThe social and the physical surrounding in which a person lives, conducts himself or herself, grows, is called the environment. Environment also includes the context of school, family and community within which a person lives and interacts with the genetic characterization. By studying the identical and fraternal twins, the influence of environment heredity can be sorted out. Identical twins have more similarity in intelligence than fraternal twins, even when they are separated at birth and reared in different homes. They are also similar when it comes to susceptibility to schizophrenia and some personality characteristic. Recent studies show that intelligence as\nwell as the amount of grey matter is more correlated in identical twins than in  fraternal  twins  (Thompson  et  al,  2001).  Intelligent  people  have  more grey matter and the amount of grey matter appears to be strongly related to genetic factors."

    "context_enriched_content": "Experiment with Twin Study\nIn a twin study, 7000 paired identical and fraternal twins were compared on the personality test of extraversion and neuroticism (Rose and others, 1988). The identical twins had more similarity than the fraternal twins on both the personality traits, suggesting that gene influences both traits.\nIn another type of twin study, researchers evaluate identical twins that have been reared in separate environments. If their behaviour is similar, the  assumption is that  heredity  has  played  an  important  role  in  shaping their  behaviour. This strategy is based on the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart, directed by Thomas Bouchard and his colleagues (1996). They bring identical twins that have been reared apart to Minneapolis from all over the world to study their behaviour. They ask many questions about their vocational orientation, childhood environment and family, values and personal interests. Also, their medical history along with information about their exercise habits, diet and smoking are obtained.\nCritics argue that some of the separated twins in the Minnesota study had been together several months prior to their adoption, that some had been reunited prior to their testing (in some cases, for a number of years), that adoption agencies often put identical twins in similar homes, and that even strangers who spend several hours together are likely to come up with some coincidental similarities (L E Adler, 1991).\nBehaviour genetics also use adoption studies to try to determine whether the behaviour of adopted children is more like that of their biological parents or their adopted parents. Another type of adoption study compares biological and adopted siblings. In one study, the educational levels attend by biological parents were better predictors of the adopted children's IQ scores than were the IQs of the children's adoptive parents (Scarr and Weinberg, 1983). Because of the stronger genetic link between the adopted children and their biological parents, the implication is that heredity plays an important role in intelligence. However, numerous studies document the critical role of environment in intelligence as well (R J Sternberg and E L Grigorenko, 2001).\nNOTES\nThe Study of Development\nNOTES\nBehaviour genetics is  the  science  of  heredity  which  studies  the origins of behaviour that determine how much of the behaviour is the result of  genetic  inheritance  and  how  much  due  to  person's  experience.  DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a very special kind of molecule (the smallest particle of a substance) that still has all the properties of the substances. DNA consists of two strands, each composed of certain sugars and phosphates. Due to the unique shapes of DNA each molecule of DNA is linked end to end with the others, forming a very long strand, sections of this DNA strand are linked by the amines, which are usually referred to by letters A, T, G and C. Amines are organic structures that contain the genetic codes for building the proteins that make up organic life chain colouring, muscles and skin. It controls the life of each cell. Each section of DNA containing a certain sequence of these amines is called a gene. Genes are located on rod-shaped structures called chromosomes, which are found in the nucleolus of a cell. Humans have a total of forty-six chromosomes in each cell of their bodies (with the exception of the egg and the sperm). Twenty-three of these chromosomes come from the mother's egg and the other 23 from the father's sperm. Most characteristics are determined by twenty-two such pairs, called the autosomes. The last pair determines the sex of the person. These two chromosomes are called the sex chromosomes. There is a gene for hair colour on each chromosome. The actual colour of the person's hair will be determined by those two genes, one gene from each parent. Some genes that are more active in influencing the trait are called dominant. A dominant gene will always be expressed in the actual trait. A person with a dominant brown hair colour gene will have brown hair, no matter what the other gene is."

These genes tend to recede, or fade into the background when paired with a more dominant gene. These are called recessive. Several genetic disorders are carried by recessive genes. Diseases carried by recessive genes are inherited when a child inherits two recessive genes, one from each parent. Disorders inherited in this manner are cystic fibrosis (a disease of the respiratory and digestive tracts, sickle cell anaemia (a blood disorder). Each cell and each sperm are supposed to have twenty-three chromosomes. In the creation of these cells a chromosome can end up in the wrong cell, leaving one cell with only twenty-two and the other with twenty-four. If either of these cells survives to mate, the missing or extra chromosome can cause mild to severe problems in development (American Academy of Paediatrics, 1995; Barnes and Carey, 2002; Gardner and Sutherland, 1996). Down syndrome is a disorder in which there is an extra chromosome in what would normally be the twenty-first pair. Symptoms include almond-shaped, wide-set eyes and mental retardation (Baren and Carey, 2002; Hernandez and Fisher, 1996). Klinefelter's syndrome is a disorder in which the twenty-three set of sex chromosomes is XXY with the extra X producing a male with reduced\nmasculine characteristics enlarge breast, obesity and excessive height (Bock, 1993) and Turner's Syndrome is a disorder in females in which the twentythird pair is actually missing on X, so that the result is a lone X chromosome (Rauke and W Saenger, 2001). These females tend to be very short infertile and sexually under developed (American Academy of Paediatrics, 1995; Rover 1993)."

Those who are successful pass on their genes to the next generation; those who are less successful do not.\nIn this evolutionary psychology view, psychological functions have become more specialized over human history (David Buss, 2000, 2004; L Cosmides and others, 2003). The specialized psychological functions that evolutionary psychologists study are as follows:\n- Development of a fear of strangers between 3 and 24 months of age, as well as very common fears of snakes, spiders, heights, open spaces and darkness (Marks, 1987).\n- Perceptual adaptations for tracking motion (Ashida, Seiffert, and Osaka, 2001).\n- Children imitate high-status models and not low-status models (A Bandura, 1977).\nThroughout the world, kind, intelligent, and dependable mates are preferred (David Buss and others, 1990). Evolutionary psychologists believe that  these  specialized  functions  developed  because  they  helped  humans adapt and solve problems in past environments (S J C Gaulin and D H McBurney, 2004). Some critics caution that evolutionary psychology places too much emphasis on the biological foundations of behaviour. For example, Albert Bandura (1998), whose social cognitive theory acknowledges the importance of human adaptation and change, rejects what he calls 'one-sided evolutionism', in which social behaviour is considered to be solely the product of evolved biology. Psychologist, Bandura recommends a bidirectional view:\nThe Study of Development\nNOTES\nThe Study of Development"

    "context_enriched_content": "3.2 IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN AFFECTING CHILD DEVELOPMENT\nWe will in this section discuss the ways in which environmental factors affect child development.\n1.  Family Relationships : The primary and significant impact on the growth and development of the child is his or her family. The family nurtures and protects the children both physically and emotionally. Different parenting styles such as disciplinarian, easygoing or mixed influence are all aspects of development of the child. The families where elders of the family spend the time with their children contribute in a positive manner in their development. On the contrary, children who are abused or neglected by their families suffer in terms of their mental and emotional well being.It is important to ensure the maintenance of healthy relationship with the children. It is equally important that the entire family should be amicable among themselves.\n2.  Physical Environment :  The effect of the physical surroundings of the child is of paramount interest. The personality of the child can be affected by a congested environment. The child seeks alternative forms of attention if there are many family members creating a possibility of rift between the parents and the children. The child's school must be selected on the basis of the needs of the child. It is important for the parents to be updated with school activities, meet their teachers regularly, and interact with their peers and their parents. They can be enrolled in co-curricular activities outside school such as sports, music, arts programmes, meditation, music classes, and so on, depending upon the feasibility and interest of the child.\n3.  Financial Situation : The financial condition of the family determines the kind of society one decides to live in. The financial conditions have a greater impact on childhood development. Wealth also helps to secure better academic training, opportunities for travel, tuition classes, and many other factors. It is essential for parents to be intricately involved in the lives of their children. It is important for parents to make them understand the financial management and to make them care for basic things. Children can thrive in a poor family as long as they are loved and wanted. The children are more influenced by the quality of time spent with them. Children with a poor financial status may face the problem of poor nutrition, which limits their ability to succeed.\n4. Health and Nutrition : Families belonging to the lower strata of the society also have less access to nutrition, which can limit the potential of  their  children. Adequate  nutrition is important for the physical and mental growth of a child and is related to important functional\nEnvironment and Development\nNOTES\nEnvironment and Development\nNOTES\noutcomes at later ages. A balanced diet is also required by pregnant women, as under nutrition can lead to problems such as low birth weight, miscarriages stillbirths, slowed development, and so on. In children, habits like unhealthy or excessive eating can lead to weight gain, obesity, diabetes, stunted growth, lethargy, and a host of other complications. It is important for a mother to feed her child as it is an ideal food consisting of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, antibodies and everything a growing newborn needs. After the first six months, one can complement their child's diet with solid foods. It is important to ensure that they get full balanced diet which must comprise of micronutrients such as vitamins, iodine, iron, the lack of which can cause serious problems like vision defects, anaemia and various other diseases. These problems have been linked with reduced motor skills and social development of toddlers and young children.\n5. Learning : In addition to learning at school, home environment also plays a significant role in the mental development of the child. It includes cognitive, linguistic, emotional and motor skills. The best environment for the development is a calm and loving home facilitating the  children  to  focus  on  improving  their  abilities. The  absence  of such a stimulating environment can have a negative impact on the child's language and speech developments including the absence of stimulation, anxiety, constant shifts in their environment and various other aspects. The parents must provide opportunities for their child to  explore their interests, especially at home. Encouraging them to question everything and teaching them to find solutions by themselves instils a sense of curiosity and sense of confidence. The parents should expose their children to the right kinds of environments as they will have a direct impact on their behaviour, learning, and personality. The major things to remember are keeping the home environment peaceful and loving, bonding with the children, and providing them with the necessities required to grow and thrive."

    "context_enriched_content": "3.2.1 Physical Environment and Development\nPhysical environment plays an important role in the development process. The following factors affect the physical environment.\n- Genetics: Sometimes, children inherit certain genes and physical traits from their parents that can hinder overall development. Down syndrome, for example, is one genetic condition that causes delays in physical and intellectual development. Turner syndrome is another inherited chromosomal disorder that affects the physical, emotional and cognitive development in female children, often resulting in physical abnormalities and learning disabilities.\n- Nutrition: Nutrition  is  essential  to  healthy  child  development. Healthy children who continually receive proper nutrition will thrive developmentally, while malnourished children may suffer problems in physical, cognitive and behavioural development. It is significant to  promote healthy eating habits among children. Routinely eating unhealthy foods such as junk food and fast food contributes to obesity and diabetes, which can impede normal physical, emotional and social development in a variety of different ways.\n- Involvement in Physical Activities: Exercise  promotes  healthy physical development which impacts growth in other areas as well. According to studies undertaken, a direct link between physical activity and improved cognitive ability has been found out.\n- Environment: Environmental  factors  directly  impact  a  child's development in many ways. Unsanitary living conditions can harm children's health and hinder developmental growth, while isolation from peers can inhibit social development. Children who grow up in environments that provide little or no mental or sensory stimulation might lag in cognitive development."

    "context_enriched_content": "NOTES\nEnvironment and Development\nNOTES\n- Social  Relationships :  The  interactions  and  relationships  between various individuals or groups are termed as 'social relationships'. In every society, individuals develop relationships with other individuals to enable them to achieve their goals. These relationships may be entered into consciously or unconsciously. The obligations, expectations, trust and norms of any relationship influence the extent to which these relationships enable an individual to develop 'social capital'. Social network is a strong, supportive network of individuals who provides access to emotional and physical resources which an individual needs to fulfil their goals. The school has a huge impact on the child's social environment. In reverse, the social environment largely determines who children form social relationships with and the qualities of those social relationships, as many of the relationships children form are within their family or neighbourhood. As such, parents' decisions (or, on the contrary, lack of decision making power) about where to live, work and school can markedly affect the health and wellbeing of their children.\nThe availability of employment opportunities within a neighbourhood or community may also affect a child's development, by influencing their  parents'  work. If the parents are working in near localities, it will give them more time to spend with their children.Work-related stress and time constraints have been shown to have negative effects on individuals and spill over into the family and affect relationships within it, including the quality of parent-child relationships.\n- Community Resources : Parents teachers and other stakeholders (for example, community members, family, and friends) together play a significant role in the education of the child. The degree of cohesion amongst members of the community (measured, for example, by the presence or absence of community organizations or community activism) influences the nature of these relationships. Communities characterised by high levels of cohesion, such as those with active community groups, provide good opportunities for individuals to become involved in and develop the resources in their community. The rules and norms which govern a community can also exert an influence. Factors relating to an individual's personal circumstances also influence the extent to which they are able to access resources within the community. For example, the length of time an individual has lived in a community influences the extent to which they engage with resources in the community, and residential stability increases an individual's sense of belonging to a community and access to resources. A parent's work situation may also influence their access to community resources. For example, parents who are working fulltime or working\nlong distances away from their home community may find it difficult to get involved in community organisations.\n- Social Relationships : The social environment also influences the nature and quality of the social relationships in which parents and children engage. Developing and maintaining positive social relationships like building trust, mutual respect, love and happiness is fundamental for a good quality of life and psychological health. Individuals who have good relationships develop a sense of belonging and receive support from other members of their social network which helps them to function normally from day to day and also to cope with stress and difficult  times.  Social  relationships  also  provide  opportunities  for generating new ideas, discussing issues and concerns, sharing good news and obtaining social, economic and emotional support. However, some social relationships involve negative emotions and behaviours (for example, lack of trust, envy, jealousy, breaking promises and violence) which may undermine an individual's wellbeing and life quality.\nDevelopment of positive social relationships is reinforced by engaging in a  good social environment. There is an increasing recognition that social behaviours are learned and that children must be taught pro-social behaviour. Children learn from their social environment and their daily observations of their environment are likely to determine their social behaviour. Social skills can also be actively taught, for example when a parent or teacher reinforces and encourages good behaviours, the probability of these behaviours occurring is enhanced. Teachers and parents may also actively encourage children to apply social skills learnt in one social setting (for example, the classroom) to other settings (for example, home or the playground).\nBoth the parent's and children's social relationships are increasingly recognized as important factors in contributing to the child's holistic development. The parents who have strong and supportive social relationships are more likely to develop positive social relationships themselves and will possess positive and supportive social relationships and networks which improve a child's development. In terms of parenting, social relationships of key importance include those between a child and their parents, but also a child and other adults (for example, teachers, and other children's parents) and other children (including their siblings). Parental involvement with the parents of other children creates trust and obligations, as well as community norms, which the parents set collectively for their children. Relationships between parents and children also affect a child's ability to develop social relationships in the community. One study reported that the children of parents who had difficulty disciplining their children and being affectionate towards\nEnvironment and Development\nNOTES\nEnvironment and Development\nNOTES\nthem due to financial stress, received lower teacher ratings in terms of their social behaviour compared to children whose parents did not experience these difficulties."

Those who live in poor quality neighbourhoods (for example, low socio-economic status) are more likely to drop out of school before completion than those who do not.\nAttending early childhood education, at which a child can develop social  relationships  with  other  children  and  teachers  and  in  doing so, develop pro-social behaviour, has a particularly profound effect on future academic achievement. Children who attend pre-school perform better academically and are less likely to repeat a grade. Cognitive development is influenced by the social environment during early  childhood  even  if  a  child  subsequently  moves  to  a  different neighbourhood. An intergenerational  effect  is  also  present,  and children whose parents grew up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods also experience impaired cognitive development and educational attainment compared to those who did not, even if they grow up in a more affluent neighbourhood.\n- Risk-taking Behaviour : Growing up in a positive social environment is associated with less risk taking behaviour. Children who grow up in positive environments are less likely to have accidents requiring treatment than those who do not. There is also a reduced risk of developing a substance use disorder amongst children who have positive social relationships compared to those who do not.\n- Emotional and Psychological Well-being : The sense of belonging which individuals experiences when they have good social relationships has a positive influence on their mental health. Children who have good social relationships have greater self esteem than those who do  not  and  are  less  likely  to  experience  mental  health  problems including depression and anxiety. There is also evidence that pro-social behaviour during childhood leads to better psychological health in adulthood.\n- Motivation : Individuals living in social environments characterised by positive social relationships are more motivated than those who do not. For example, peer support has been found to be an important predictor of a child's motivation to pursue social goals, while teacher\nsupport increases a child's motivation for both social and academic goal pursuits. Parent support also influences children in terms of their level of interest in school and their pursuit of goals.\n- Physical  Health :  A  positive  social  environment  also  promotes improved physical health, including proper reading habits and increased participation in sports events."

It is used in critical terms in industrial based societies which produce pollutants that can harm the human physical health which can impact psychological damage.\nThis poor mental environment may help explain why rates of mental illness are reportedly higher in industrial societies which might also have its roots in poor educational environment and mechanical routinised life present. Magico-religious beliefs are an important contribution of such communal settings. Delusions such as these rooted from childhood are often hard to completely regulate from a person's life.\nThe idea has its roots in evolutionary psychology, as the deleterious consequences of a poor mental environment can be explained by the mismatch between the mental environment humans evolved to exist within and the one they exist within today. Mental health describes the level of psychological well being or an absence of a mental disorder. These mental disorders can range from problems such as depression to schizophrenia.

The personality of the child can be affected by a congested environment.\n- The child's school must be selected on the basis of the needs of the child. It is important for the parents to be updated with school activities, meet their teachers regularly, and interact with their peers and their parents.\n- The financial condition of the family determines the kind of society one decides to live in. The financial conditions have a greater impact on childhood development.\n- Families belonging to the lower strata of the society also have less access to nutrition, which can limit the potential of their children.\n- In  addition  to  learning  at  school,  home  environment  also  plays  a significant role in the mental development of the child. It includes cognitive, linguistic, emotional and motor skills.\n- The parents must provide opportunities for their child to explore their interests, especially at home. Encouraging them to question everything and teaching them to find solutions by themselves instils a sense of curiosity and sense of confidence.\n- Nutrition is essential to healthy child development. Healthy children who continually receive proper nutrition will thrive developmentally, while malnourished children may suffer problems in physical, cognitive and behavioural development.\n- Exercise promotes healthy physical development which impacts growth in other areas as well. According to studies undertaken, a direct link between physical activity and improved cognitive ability has been found out.\n- The  social  environment  refers  to  an  individual's  physical surroundings, community resources and social relationships.\n- The physical surrounding of a social environment includes home environment, opportunities for education, health maintenance facilities, job opportunities and open space for playful activities.\n- The community resources include all the community structures and organizations and support within the community.\n- Living in a socio-economically deprived, underdeveloped community, has a negative impact on child development.\n- The interactions and relationships between various individuals or groups are termed as 'social relationships'.\n- In every society, individuals develop relationships with other individuals to enable them to achieve their goals.\n- The obligations, expectations, trust and norms of any relationship influence the extent to which these relationships enable an individual to develop 'social capital'.\n- Social network is a strong, supportive network of individuals who provides  access  to  emotional  and  physical  resources  which  an individual needs to fulfil their goals.\n- The availability of employment opportunities within a neighbourhood or community may also affect a child's development, by influencing their parents' work.\n- Communities characterised by high levels  of  cohesion,  such  as those with active community groups, provide good opportunities for individuals to become involved in and develop the resources in their community.\n- The social environment also influences the nature and quality of the social relationships in which parents and children engage.\nEnvironment and Development"

They first learn to control their head and neck and then arms and then manipulate their fingers. They also first learn to move their torso and then learn to move their arms and legs.\nIn this unit, the principles of development changes, the aspects of physical development in babyhood and childhood have been discussed.

The very visible changes in body size are accompanied by less visible ones in body proportions, skeletal structure, bones, muscles and internal organs of the body. The general growth pattern in children involves rapid growth during infancy, slower gains in early and middle childhood, and rapid growth spurt again during adolescence with puberty. The changes in size, proportions and muscles support the development a number of large or gross motor skills and fine motor skills amongst children. As the child grows, it is natural for the child to develop gross motor skills before the fine motor skills.\nGrowth indicates the quantitative changes in the body structure such as  height  and  weight,  and  development includes the changes in both the qualitative and quantitative way. Development is the continuous series of orderly cohesive transformations. The various types of developmental changes follow certain principles. Some of these principles are as follows:\n- Growth and development follow an orderly sequence.\n- Each child normally passes through a number of stages, each with its own essential characteristics.\n- There are individual differences in rate and pattern of development.\n- Though the human being develops as a unified whole, yet each part of the body develops at a different rate.\n- Development is essentially the result of the interaction between maturation and learning. While maturation is the 'unfolding of characteristics  potentially  present  in  the  individual's  genetic endowment', learning refers to the relatively enduring 'changes that come about as a result of experience and practice.'"

Based on research studies, there are suggestive ranges of height and weight for a particular age. The growth in the height and weight are important for determining the normal living of a child.

The skeletal structure of an infant is soft which is composed mainly of cartilages. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. As the child grows, the bines become stronger and the length is elongated. This process of hardening of the bones is known as ossification. It begins early in the first year and ends during puberty.\nMuscles play an important role in the functioning of body organs like the heart and the digestive system. They are also responsible for strength and co-ordination of activities. By adolescence, the small muscles too gain maturity.

Initially, babies' movements are simply the uncontrolled, reflexive movements they are born with. Over time, they learn to move their body parts voluntarily to perform both gross (large) and fine (small) motor skills. In general, babies begin developing motor skills from the center of the body outward and from head to tail. They learn to control their head and neck before they learn to manoeuvre their arms; they learn to manoeuvre their arms before they learn to manipulate their fingers. Babies learn to move their torso before they learn how to move their arms and legs.\nThe sucking reflex allows babies to drink milk and nourish themselves in  the  first  days  of  life.  This  is  a  permanent  ability,  but  as  babies grow, they can control when they drink. Another permanent and lifesupporting reflex is head turning. This reflex allows a baby to turn his head if something (a blanket, pillow, or stuffed animal) is blocking his airflow. Another reflex that also helps babies survive is the rooting reflex. When babies root, they may nuzzle their face and mouth into the caregiver's chest or shoulder. This may help them find a food source, such as their mother's breast; this helps the baby communicate to caregivers that they are hungry and ready to eat. Rooting disappears around 3 weeks of age.\nThe rest of the reflexes have less survival value but are still notable. For the first 3 to 4 months, babies have an amazing grasping ability and reflex. They will grasp anything placed in their palm and hold it with amazing strength for their size; some infants in the first weeks of life can support their entire body weight through that grasp. While this reflex may not have any survival function in modern times, it does help babies bond with caregivers and family in the first weeks of life. Similarly, for the first two months, babies will 'step' with their legs if they are held vertically with their feet touching a surface. Even though this reflex disappears months before babies begin walking purposefully, experts believe stepping helps infants learn how their legs work and can be used. The Moro response is another reflex that is present during the first 6 months of life, but doesn't seem to have a purpose in modern life. A baby will arch her back, flail out, and then curl up if she feels as though she is being dropped. The final reflex this article will mention is the tonic neck. During the first 4 months, when babies lie awake on their backs with their heads facing to one side, they will extend the arm on the side of their body that they're facing and flex the other arm at\nNOTES\nDevelopment during Infancy"

This reflex may help prepare them for voluntary reaching later in their development.\n- Body Size : During babyhood, these changes are most rapid - faster than they would be at any time after birth. In the first two years, growth is very rapid. From 2 years onwards, the growth rate slows down a bit and is not as rapid as it was up to 2 years of age.\n- Body Proportion : During infancy, the head of the infant is much larger in proportion to the rest of the body. It constitutes 1/4th of the total body length as compared to 1/8th in the case of adults. The head grows in width up to age 3, but continues to grow in length until eighteen years of age. The growth pattern is the same for body and girls, though boys' heads are slightly larger than girls' heads at every age\n- Changes in Skeletal Structure : The bones of an infant are soft and flexible  as  they  are  composed  mainly of cartilages. Cartilages are flexible connective tissue found in many parts of human body, including the joints between bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the bronchial tubes and the inter-vertebral discs. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. As the child grows, his/her bones become broader as well as longer. This process of hardening of the bones is known as ossification. It begins early in the first year and ends during puberty. At birth, the infant has approximately 270 bones. Though the bones of an infant do not fracture very easily; they are quite susceptible to deformities as a result of their soft and flexible nature.  At birth, girls are more advanced than boys in bone development\n- Teeth : When the foetus is six week old and when the baby is born, her teeth are already in the process of development. The first teeth usually erupt between 4 and 12 months of age, with the average at seven months. By the age of two and a half years, children have 20 teeth. These teeth are temporary and are often called primary or milk teeth."

Erikson, Kohlberg, Piaget, and Bronfenbrenner, explain the more subtle changes that occur inside the body.\nPhysical changes in early childhood are accompanied by rapid changes in the child's cognitive and language development. From the moment they are born, children use all their senses to attend to their environment, and they begin to develop a sense of cause and effect from their actions and the responses of caregivers. Children begin to lose their baby fat, or chubbiness, around age 3. Toddlers soon acquire the leaner, more athletic look associated\nwith childhood. The child's trunk and limbs grow longer, and the abdominal muscles form, tightening the appearance of the stomach. Even at this early stage of life, boys tend to have more muscle mass than girls. The preschoolers' physical proportions also continue to change, with their heads still being disproportionately large, but less so than in toddlerhood.\n3 year old preschoolers may grow to be about 38 inches tall and weigh about 32 pounds. For the next 3 years, healthy preschoolers grow an additional 2 to 3 inches and gain from 4 to 6 pounds per year. By age 6, children reach a height of about 46 inches and weigh about 46 pounds. Of course, these figures are averages and differ from child to child, depending on socioeconomic status, nourishment, health, and heredity factors.\nHeight : Growth rate slows: the average child in this stage grows 21/2 inches in height and 5-7 pounds per year. By the age of six, the size of the trunk is double from birth. The legs grow at a slower rate than the arms. By 6 years of age, a child's legs equal about half her body length. This ratio remains constant for the rest of his or her life.\nWeight : The average annual increase in weight is 3 to 5 pounds. At age 6, children should gain weight approximately six times as much as they did at birth. The average girl weighs 48.5 pounds, and the average boy weighs 49 pounds. Body fat declines during preschool years.\nBody build :  Body  differences  are  fairly  seen  during  this  period.  Some children have an endomorphic of flabby, fat body, some have mesomorphic sturdy look, muscular body build and some have an ectomorphic or thin body. Boys have more muscle while girls have more fat. The boy's muscles become larger, stronger, and heavier. Physical growth further slows down in early and middle childhood. By the time a child is 5 years old, she is usually about twice as tall as she was at birth and weight about five times her birth weight. During the next few years, children add about 2 to 3 inches in height and 2 to 3 kilograms in weight each year. At ages, 6 to 8, girls are slightly shorter and lighter than boys. By age 9, this trend reverses in favour of boys. Later, in adolescence period, puberty brings a sharp acceleration in body size.\nMotor skills : Gross and fine motor skills progress rapidly. Gross motor skills include running, skipping and jumping. Fine motor skills include turning pages of a book and learning to write and draw.\nBrain development : The most important physical development during early childhood is the brain and nervous system growth. Brain and nervous system developments during early childhood also continue to be dramatic. The better developed the brain and nervous systems are the more complex behavioural and cognitive abilities children are capable of.\nThe brain is  comprised of two halves, the right and left  cerebral hemispheres.

Although the hemispheres may have separate functions, these brain masses almost always coordinate their functions and work together.\nThe two cerebral hemispheres develop at different rates, with the left hemisphere developing more fully in early childhood (ages 2 to 6), and the right hemisphere developing more fully in middle childhood (ages 7 to 11). The left hemisphere predominates earlier and longer, which may explain why children acquire language so early and quickly.\nBody proportion and shape : The average preschool child requires 1700 calories per day. Well balanced meals are important in this stage because their diet affects skeletal growth, body shape and susceptibility to disease.\nTeeth : During the first four to six months of this stage, the last four baby teeth-the back molars-erupt. During the last half year of early childhood, the baby teeth begin to replace by permanent teeth. When early childhood is over, the child generally has one or two permanent teeth in front and some gaps where permanent teeth will eventually erupt. Around six years of age, most children begin to lose their milk teeth. Beginning with joint teeth, their permanent teeth start erupting. Between the ages 6 to 12, all 20 primary teeth are replaced by permanent ones, with girls losing their teeth slightly earlier than boys. The first teeth to go are the lower and upper front teeth which give many 7-year and 8-year old children a 'toothless' smile. The first molars appear at about the age of 6. These are permanent teeth just behind the milk teeth and are often mistaken for milk teeth."

There are about 50 essential  nutrients  grouped  into  six  categories  -  carbohydrates,  proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Each of these categories is needed by our body and in amounts which are relative to age, activity and body size. School children are active and need three complete/balanced meals a day to stay alert and energetic in their everyday lives. Nutrition is an essential factor that influences growth and development of the child. Of the many environmental factors that influence development, nutrition is one of the most basic aspects. Nutrients are the chemical substances, obtained through food in various ways and are the essential fuels of life. Malnutrition essentially means 'bad nourishment'. It concerns not enough as well as too much food, the wrong types of food, and the body's response to a wide range of infections that\nresult in malabsorption of nutrients or the inability to use nutrients properly to maintain health. Clinically, malnutrition is characterized by inadequate or excess intake of protein, energy, and micronutrients such as vitamins, and the frequent infections and disorders that result. People are malnourished if they are unable to utilize fully the food they eat, for example due to diarrhoea or other illnesses (secondary malnutrition), if they consume too many calories (over-nutrition), or if their diet does not provide adequate calories and protein for growth and maintenance (under-nutrition or protein-energy malnutrition)'.\nMalnutrition in children is caused by a number of factors; most are related  to  poverty  and  poor  nutrition.  However  some  of  the  important factors also include, recurring infection that affect the absorption capacity, in particular recurrent problems of diahorrea and worm infestation affect young children, Incidentally both are preventable through hygienic practices and provision of clean and safe drinking water. Children suffering from malnutrition in the early years have been known to perform at a lower level in tasks involving mental abilities.\nDue to poor nutrition, growth of the child's brain and intellect is seriously impaired. Such a child continuously performs poorly at the preschool and elementary school stages and often parents pull the child out of school. The child thus, misses the chance to continue study and gets caught in the vicious circle of poverty. The impact of malnutrition extends well into adulthood. Malnutrition is more pronounced amongst girls than boys, this is essentially due to the discrimination girls face at homes. Early marriage and early child birth by girls in their early teens is known to produce low weight babies, leading to either mortality or stunted growth. Importantly the lives of young girls are at risk due to early pregnancy. There are many parts in India where girls of elementary school age are married away."

The common physical defects are orthopaedic disabilities, unusual auditory and visual difficulties, speech defects, dental causes, and chronic diseases. Physical defects can be present at birth, or may be acquired during childhood due to illness, accident and neglect of the child's physical well being.  All these abilities can affect the child's development adversely. The affect on the child will depend on the type and severity of the defect. Diseased tonsils may not have as serious and crippling effect as blindness or some orthopaedic defect.\nDisabilities may prevent children from participating in activities with their age groups. Most children with disabilities fail to function as normal children in school and may need special facilities, medical care and attention. It is equally important for the teachers to teach children to be accepting and tolerant of children with special needs. Ignoring or rejecting such children can make them depressed and withdraw from school. These attitudes will\nNOTES\nDevelopment during Infancy"

Children experience a somewhat higher rate of illnesses such as viral fever, cold and cough during the initial two years of elementary school than they would later due to exposure to other sick children and an underdeveloped immune system. On average, illness causes children to miss a few days of school per year, but most absences can also be traced to a few students with chronic health problems.\nSome children may even suffer from chronic diseases and conditions which include physical disabilities as studied in previous section. Physical discomfort, painful medical treatments and changes in appearance often disrupt the sick child's daily life, making it difficult to concentrate in school and causing withdrawal from peers. For these reasons, chronically ill children are at risk for various cognitive, emotional and social difficulties about which we will study further in the subsequent units."

Heredity contributes to myopia because studies have found that identical twins are more likely to share the condition than fraternal twins. Early biological trauma can also induce it. School-age children with low birth weights show an especially high rate, believed to result from immaturity of visual structures, slower eye growth, and a greater incidence of eye disease.\nMyopia progresses more rapidly during the school years when children spend more time reading and doing other close work. Furthermore, it is one of  the  few  health  conditions  that  increase  with  socio-economic  status  of child's family. Fortunately, it can be corrected easily with glasses. A teacher can pay more attention to children with vision problems and make them sit near the blackboard so that they don't face problem in reading from the back benches of the classroom. Regular screening for vision permits defects to be corrected before they lead to serious learning difficulties."

The various types of developmental changes follow certain principles.\n- Development is essentially the  result  of  the  interaction  between maturation and learning.\n- While maturation is the 'unfolding of  characteristics  potentially present in the individual's genetic endowment', learning refers to the relatively enduring 'changes that come about as a result of experience and practice.'\n- The most significant signs of physical development are changes in the overall size of the child's body which can be observed through the visible changes in height and weight.\n- Genetic factor refers to what children inherit from their parents which is composed of hereditary traits that are passed on to the child.\n- Environmental factors like nutrition, socio-economic status, family surroundings, cultural settings, also play an important role in child's physical growth and development.\n- The growth in the height and weight are important for determining the normal living of a child.\n- Changes in skeletal structure and bones contribute to the overall physical development during childhood.\n- The skeletal structure of an infant is soft which is composed mainly of cartilages. It is not as hard and rigid as bone but is stiffer and less flexible than muscle.\n- Muscles play an important role in the functioning of body organs like the heart and the digestive system.\n- Infants need to learn how to move and to use their bodies to perform various tasks, a process better known as motor development.\n- The Moro response is another reflex that is present during the first 6 months of life, but doesn't seem to have a purpose in modern life.\n- The bones of an infant are soft and flexible as they are composed mainly of cartilages.\n- Cartilages are flexible connective tissue found in many parts of human body, including the joints between bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the bronchial tubes and the intervertebral discs.\n- Early childhood period is more developing period in respect to the cognitive, physical social and language.\n- Physical changes in early childhood are accompanied by rapid changes in the child's cognitive and language development.\n- Gross motor skills include running, skipping and jumping. Fine motor skills include turning pages of a book and learning to write and draw.\n- The most important physical development during early childhood is the brain and nervous system growth.\n- Lateralization  refers  to  the  localization  of  assorted  functions, competencies, and skills in either or both hemispheres.\n- Nutrients are the chemical substances in various ways to supply energy, build and maintain body cells and to regulate body processes.\n- Nutrients are the chemical substances, obtained through food in various ways and are the essential fuels of life.\n- Malnutrition in children is caused by a number of factors; most are related to poverty and poor nutrition.\n- Heredity contributes to myopia because studies have found that identical twins are more likely to share the condition than fraternal twins."

By the age of six, the trunk (i.e., body minus head) is twice as long and wide as it was at birth. The child gradually becomes slim until pre-puberty, when the body widens out again. The length of the arms and hands increases between 60 to 75 per cent from birth to two years. At the age of 8 years, the arms are nearly 50 per cent larger than what it was at two years and are thin in appearance, giving\nthe child an all adult's look. The legs grow at a slower rate than the arms. By 6 years of age, a child's legs equal about half her body length. This ratio remains constant for the rest of his or her life.

The bones of an infant are soft and flexible. As the child grows, bones become broader as well as longer. It begins early in the first year and ends during puberty. At birth, the infant has approximately 270 bones. By puberty, this number increases to about 350. During middle childhood, the bones of the body lengthen and broaden. However, ligaments are not yet firmly attached to bones. As their bodies become stronger, many children experience a greater desire to physical exercise. With the increase in size, there is an increase in number of bones as well which leads to increase in weight at all periods of growth. The development of fatty tissues is more prominent in early childhood there is an evident increase in weight. During middle childhood, the muscles of the child are still developing. Children, therefore need constant change of activities to activate different groups of muscles and to relieve fatigue from the tired muscles. The child has better control over her or his muscles and her or his movements become more coordinated, efficient and refined. By adolescence, the small muscles too gain maturity. A nutritious diet and a regular routine with physical activities and proper rest would enhance the healthy development of muscles and fatty tissues in children."

Between two and three years of age children acquire:\n- A 400-word vocabulary including names\n- A word for most everything\n- The use of pronouns\n- Three to five-word sentences\n- The ability to describe what they just saw or experienced\n- The use of the past tense and plurals\n- Names for body parts, colors, toys, people, and objects\n- The ability to repeat rhymes, songs, and stories\n- The ability to answer 'what' questions\nChildren constantly produce sentences that they have not heard before, creating rather than imitating. This creativity is based on the general principles and rules of language that they have mastered. By the time, a child is three years of age; most of a child's speech can be understood. However, like adults, children vary greatly in how much they choose to talk."

Genetic factor includes the hereditary traits inherited from their parents.\n- As children grow from infancy to childhood, changes in the body structure are visible from the differences in the proportion of body organs.\n- During infancy, the head of the infant is much larger in proportion to the rest of the body. The growth pattern is the same for body and girls.\n- Changes in skeletal structure  and  bones  contribute  to  the  overall physical development during childhood.\n- The development of fatty tissues is more prominent in early childhood there is an evident increase in weight.\n- Embryological formation of the head and neck is a complex process that begins very early in human development.\n- The development of external face starts between the 4 th and 6 th  week of embryonic development. The development of the face is completed by the 6 th  week.\n- During the 4th week, the oropharyngeal membrane begins to break down in order to become the future oral cavity , and sits at the beginning of the digestive tract.\n- Nasal development is instigated by the appearance of raised bumps called nasal placodes on both sides of the frontonasal prominence.\n- Initially, the nasal cavity is continuous with the oral cavity. A series of steps lead to their separation, and the establishment of the palate .\n- Length in children who are too young to stand is measured while children lie on their back on a suitable device, such as a measuring table (called a stadiometer).\n- Normal-term newborns typically lose 5 to 8 per cent of their birth weight during the first few days of life.\n- Language development is the process by which children come to understand and communicate language during early childhood.\n- The stages of language development are uniform which can vary from child to child on the basis of achievement of important steps.\n- Language development begins before birth. Towards the end of pregnancy, a fetus begins to hear sounds and speech coming from outside the mother's body.\n- During the second year of life, language development proceeds at very different rates in different children.\n- At 18 to 24 months of age toddlers come to understand that there are words for everything and their language development gains momentum.\n- Children constantly produce sentences that they have not heard before, creating rather than imitating.\n- Most children double their vocabularies between six and eight years of age and begin reading at about age seven.\nDevelopment of Body Parts"

    "context_enriched_content": "6.0 INTRODUCTION\nA motor skill is a function involving the precise movement of muscles with the intention of performing a specific act. Motor skills are movements and actions of the muscles. Typically, they are categorized into two groups: gross motor skills and fine motor skills.\nGross motor skills are involved in movement and coordination of the arms, legs, and other large body parts and movements. Gross motor skills can be further divided into two subgroups of locomotor skills and object control skills. Gross locomotor skills include running, jumping, sliding, and swimming. Object control skills include throwing, catching and kicking.\nFine motor skills are involved in smaller movements that occur in the wrists, hands, fingers, and the feet and toes. They participate in smaller actions such as picking up objects between the thumb and finger, writing carefully, and even blinking. These two motor skills work together to provide coordination. Less developed kids focus on their gross movements; while more developed kids have more control over their fine movements. Motor development is defined as the development of a child's bones and muscles and their ability to manipulate his or her environment.\nIn this unit, the meanings of gross motor skills and fine motor skills and their components have been discussed. The ways in which one can improve these skills has also been highlighted. The unit will also discuss the meaning of motor development and the components of self-care skills."

These are crucial for everyday self-care skills like dressing (where you need to be able to stand on one leg to put your leg into a pant leg without falling over). Gross motor abilities also have an influence on other everyday functions. For example, a child's ability to maintain table top posture (upper body support) will affect their ability to participate in fine motor skills (for example, writing, drawing and cutting) and sitting upright to attend to class instruction, which then impacts on their academic learning. Gross motor skills impact on your endurance to cope with a full day of school (for example, sitting upright at a desk, moving between classrooms, carrying your heavy school bag)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Difference between Gross Motor Skills and Fine Motor Skills\nBy definition, gross motor skills are the skills learned and acquired when a person is still a baby up until early childhood, which is part of an individual's motor development. Once a child reaches the age of two, they will be able to stand up, walk, run, and walk up the stairs. Such skills are developed throughout early childhood and will continue to be controlled throughout the years of development into adulthood. It is safe to say that gross motor skills come from a huge group of muscles and the movement of the entire body. Fine motor skills pertain to the coordination of muscle movements in the body like the eyes, toes, fingers and so on. They allow one to write, grasp small objects, and fasten clothing. Fine motor skills enhance one's strength, fine motor control, and dexterity in the hands. Both fine and gross motor skills can be assessed. This is assessed using the Peabody Motor scale, most commonly known as a PDHS-2. The child would have to stand up as instructed by the therapist. This is to assess their stationary position, which requires them to take a 30-item test that would assess their locomotion as well. Babies can lift their heads up and gradually sit upright. The child would then have to crawl, stand, and walk. This is the assessment of the child's ability to move with some assistance, like the other children their age. Additionally, the therapist may check the child's ability to throw, catch, and kick a ball. Lastly, they will conduct a visual motor perceptive ability test.\nBoth gross and fine motor skills are essential to the physical and mental development of a child. What you can do is enhance these motor skills by incorporating activities into your child's life. Fine motor skills can be developed by giving them a paper and crayons; this will enhance the dexterity of their hands. Choose activities that can keep their hands busy. As for gross motor skills, you can allow your child to play outside with a ball. Another good activity would be to take them to the park and play in the playground just like the other children."

Sensory motor development is dependent upon nutrition that the child gets to a great extent. Children get stronger and development is good if they get nutritious food.\n- Immunisation : If mother and child both are immunized at a proper time it leads to good sensory motor development.\n- Environment: Encouragement, love and security help the child to take risk to explore fearlessly and to know more about environment which leads to a better sensory development.\n- Opportunities: Children who get more opportunities to do more activities, motor development is better in them. Opportunities to play to gain knowledge give a better chance of developing sensory motor activities."

The ability, to walk develops in a series of stages.\nAs the child reaches preschool years, she discovers that she can do many things as there are great advances in strength, speed and coordination.\nBy about age five she is capable of jumping, running and climbing. Between 2 and 5, children's play consists largely of these large muscle activities. By the age of 6, most children have mastered the basic motor skills such as sitting, walking, running, jumping, pushing, pulling, grasping and throwing. They can balance themselves on a rail, a wall and a chalk mark on the floor.\nChildren of 6, 7 and 8 years continue to enjoy strenuous physical activity. Any activity that uses the large muscles is likely to be enjoyed by all children of these ages. Games that involve running, jumping and climbing are enjoyed more than sitting.

At this age, the fine motor skills that a child has are rudimentary. However, these improve as the child grows. From age 6 to 10, there is a progressive improvement in the attainment of these skills. If given the opportunity to learn and practice, children can easily acquire these skills.\nThere is a great variation in the achievement of fine motor skills. The child learn to do the things for which, he or she has the ability, the opportunity to practice and is given encouragement for accomplishment.\nThere is a steady improvement in the acquisition of fine motor skills by the child as she grows. The child gains better-control over her eye and hand movements. By 6 years of age, most children can make objects out of paper or clay, do simple craft work, and sewing and write. Improvement in these skills continues not only during middle childhood but also in late childhood and adolescence.\nThere may be however, a great variation in the motor skills in individual children. A child of 9 may still be doing what another did at 6. This is because the acquisition of fine motor skills depends upon the ability, opportunity and practice that vary from child to child.\nThe pattern of development of motor skills is the same for girls and boys, but generally boys are found to be better in all physical activities as compared to girls. This could be due to the fact that boys have larger muscles and more strength than girls. This may also be due to cultural reasons, as\nboys are usually encouraged to participate in sports and games and task that involve a lot of physical activities. Girls on the other hand are encouraged to play quiet games and do more of activities that involve fine motor skills. The teacher should try to avoid this kind of discrimination and encourage boys and girls equally to participate in all kinds of activities."

Most babies feel equally at ease with and are able to use both hands, but by the age of two, they will show a definite preference for either the left or the right hand. People are said to be right handed if they use the right hand most, or left handed if they favour the left hand. People are referred to as ambidextrous if they use both hands equally well.\nRight or left handedness does not make any difference to a person's intelligence,  skills  or  personality.  But  children  who  have  been  forced  to change show some difficulties like stuttering and stammering or reading disorders. In cases where handedness appears to persist, the best way is to allow the child to pursue his/her natural pattern of development. But if you decide to change, start when the child is as young as possible. Do it gently and subtly and watch for difficulties. If there is resistance or difficulty, the effort should not be pursued.\nWhether handedness is hereditary or the result of training and social conditioning has been debated for many generations. However, there is no conclusive evidence available to decide in the issue either way.\nNOTES\nOverview of Motor Skills"

The efficiency of fine motor skills influences the quality of the task outcome as well as the speed of task performance significantly.\n- A number of independent skills are required to happen together for appropriate manipulation the object or perform the task.\n- Information that the brain receives from our muscles and joints to make us aware of our body position and body movement, so we can accurately control our movements.\n- By definition, gross motor skills are the skills learned and acquired when a person is still a baby up until early childhood, which is part of an individual's motor development.\n- Fine motor skills pertain to the coordination of muscle movements in the body like the eyes, toes, fingers and so on.\n- Fine motor skills can be developed by giving them a paper and crayons; this will enhance the dexterity of their hands.\n- Motor development refers to the enhancement and development of strength, speed and accuracy in the use of limbs and other body muscles.\n- Children get 'genes' for all the developments from their parents. It has been seen motor development of a child follows the same pattern as of his parents.\n- Nutritious food promotes good motor development. Sensory motor development is dependent upon nutrition that the child gets to a great extent.\n- The pattern of development of motor skills is the same for girls and boys, but generally boys are found to be better in all physical activities as compared to girls.\n- Prehension is the ability to grasp objects with the forefinger and thumb working smoothly in opposition.\n- Handedness means predominant use of one hand over the others. Most babies feel equally at ease with and are able to use both hands, but by the age of two, they will show a definite preference for either the left or the right hand.\n- Whether handedness is hereditary or the result of training and social conditioning has been debated for many generations.\n- Climbing is a skill which children master incrementally, as they reach developmental milestones for various gross motor skills.\n- Climbing typically begins with crawling over objects, progresses to climbing onto objects such as furniture and is fully mastered when children are able to walk down stairs unassisted using alternating feet.\n- Climbing tasks such as climbing ladders are complex tasks that require children to have good balance and coordination as well as enough strength to hold them upright while climbing.\n- Self-care skills are the daily tasks done by children for participating in life activities. These skills are expected to be developed in the children gradually as they mature.\n- Self-care skills facilitate children in development of the ability to plan and sequence task performance, to organise the necessary materials and to develop the refined physical control required to carry out daily tasks.\n- Motor development is an important aspect of the holistic development of a child. It impacts in a significant manner on the social and emotional development of the child.\nOverview of Motor Skills"

A lot of research has been done to understand the process of conceptualization in a child.\nThe first theory of cognitive development was created by the Swiss developmental psychologist, Jean Piaget. He proposed a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human intelligence. Cognitive psychology refers to the study of mental processes which includes attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\nIn this unit, the concept of cognitive development and psychology has been discussed in detail. The approaches of cognitive psychology and the theories of cognitive development have also been explained. The unit will also explain the meaning of attention, distraction, sensation, perception and concept map."

These processes include thinking, knowing, remembering, judging and problem-solving. These are higher-level functions of the brain and encompass language, imagination, perception, and planning.\nCognition is 'the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses'. It encompasses processes such as attention, the formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and 'computation', problem solving and decision-making, comprehension and production of language. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge.\nAccording  to  Ulric  Gustav  Neisser,  a  German  born American psychologist, (1976), 'Cognition is the activity of knowing: the acquisition, organization, and use of knowledge'.\nThe main focus of a cognitive approach is on the learner's mental structure  or  schema:  a  concept  combining  the  learner's  previous  related knowledge and ideas and the methods, the learner may apply in the situation present that time.\nAccording to psychologists, Glass, Holoyoak and Santa (1979), 'All our mental abilities such as perceiving, remembering and reasoning, are organized into a complex system, the overall functioning of which is termed as cognition. This facet allows us to conclude that sensing, attending, perceiving and analysing are various stages in the pursuit of cognition'.\nOne of the main significant points of the cognitive approaches is focussed on the processing and storage of information. The current modes of cognitive functioning emphasise on three things:\n1. Knowledge base : It is a storehouse of information, concepts and associations that are built from growing up, i.e., children into adults.\n2. Cognitive strategies : It refers to processes by which information becomes a part of the knowledge base and is retrieved from it or is used.\nNOTES\nCognitive Development"

Hence, cognition accommodates the activities and processes concerned with the acquisition, storage, retrieval and processing of knowledge. It also includes the processes that help us to perceive, attend, remember, think, categorize reason, decide, and many others processes.\nCognitive psychology is the branch of psychology that deals with cognitive mental processes. It can be defined as the study of processes underlying mental events. It encompasses the branch of psychology which deals with acquisition, transformation, acquisition and communication of language.\nThe examples of processes under the cognitive psychology are as follows:\n- A ttention : It refers to the process of focusing on some stimulus.\n- Perception :  It  refers  to  the  process  of  interpretation  of  sensory information.\n- Pattern Recognition : It refers to the process of classification stimuli into known categories.\n- Memory : It refers to the process which stores information for later retrieval."

It is the concentration of consciousness upon one object or idea rather than the other. Attention may be compared to the action of a photographic camera. Just as the camera is focused on a particular object or an individual or group leaving out others, in the same way attention is concentrated on a particular object. Other objects are left in the background in the unconscious or subconscious.\nEvery single moment of the child is attracted by a large number of stimuli of the environment.

Consciousness, therefore, is a wider field and includes attention. An individual attends to a part of the field of consciousness; the rest is not attended to.

There is not much difference between sensation and perception.\nThe process of detecting a stimulus such as light waves (vision), sound waves (hearing), chemical molecules (smell and taste), heat or pressure (touch) is called sensation. It is the first response of the organism to the stimuli.  Different  types  of  sensations  have  different  traits.  For  example, motor, organic and spatial sensations have different characteristics, which actually distinguish, them from each other. These different sensations have got different degrees of strength and intensity. The intensity depends upon two factors such as the objective strength of the stimulus and the mental state of the individual.\nNOTES\nCognitive Development"

The sensation can be divided into three types:\n1. Organic sensations: It  refers  to those  sensations  which  are caused by internal organs. These sensations are not because of an external stimulation. Hunger is considered to be an organic sensation, which occurs because of the contradiction of walls of the stomach.\n2. Special sensations : It refers to those sensations which are caused by the specific sense organs like eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin. These special sensations can be differentiated from each other. The source of the special sensations is external. They give information about the outside environment.\n3. Visual sensations: It refers to those sensations which are only activated or stimulated because of light waves. These types of sensations are experienced through the sense organ of eye. The visual sensations can further be classified into two types, namely: sensation of brightness and sensation of colour. Colour sensation means identifying and differentiating four types of basic colours."

When you see a flower, sensation of colour, smell, touch is aroused, meaning is given to this, and the object is perceived as a flower.\nPerception is a complex process because it is a combination of a number of sub-processes, which are listed as follows:\n- Receptor process: The  first  process  involved  in  the  process  of reception is the receptor process. For example, the rose stimulates three receptor cells and three different receptor processes of eye, nose and touch.\n- Unification process: For example to perceive rose, unification of all the three sensations are required.\n- Symbolic process: Every object reminds of something, and so a symbol is attached to it. Every time the rose is perceived, the symbol gets associated with it.\n- Affective process: Every object represents some emotions, pleasant or unpleasant. Thus, it is concluded that perception is a complex process and involves sensations and past experience."

For example, a football player has to keep track of the opponent and also adapt according to the strategies of the opponent.\n- Learning by experience: A person learns to perceive unfamiliar or new things by learning.

His contributions include a stage theory of child cognitive development, detailed observational studies of cognition in children, and a series of simple but ingenious tests to reveal different cognitive abilities.\nPiaget's  (1936)  theory  of  cognitive  development  describes  the construction of the mental model of the world by the child. He diverged from the idea that intelligence was a fixed trait, and defined cognitive development as a process which happens due to biological maturation and interaction with the environment. In this process, children construct an understanding of the world around them followed by experiencing of discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment.\nThe main purpose of Piaget was the construction of fundamental concepts of number, time, quantity, causality, justice and so on emerged. According to Piaget, children are born with a very basic mental structure (genetically inherited and evolved) on which all subsequent learning and knowledge are based.\nIn this unit, the cognitive development theory with special significance on early childhood has been described.

    "context_enriched_content": "8.2 PIAGET'S THEORY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO DEVELOPMENT UP TO THE PERIOD OF EARLY CHILDHOOD\nPiaget  introduced  four  concepts  in  the  building  of  his  theory. They  are discussed in the following section.\n1. Schemas (Cognitive structures): Piaget called 'schemas' as cognitive structures or the patterns of behaviour that children and adults use in dealing with objects in their environment. These patterns can be simple as well as complex. As the development proceeds, each pattern enlarges and changes. It is coordinated with other patterns to form more complex patterns. The infant sucks the breast of his or her mother, he or she looks at the objects of his environment, listens to different voices in his or her environment and finally he or she tries to comprehend, conceptualize the articles, animals, space and many other behaviour patterns or structures.\n2. Assimilation : Assimilation implies incorporation of something from the environment. New ideas, concepts and stimuli are taken in and incorporated into one's existing set of schema.  A scheme is an organized pattern of behaviour which the child develops when he or she is engaged in any activity. For example, when a child is engaged in sucking, there is a certain pattern of movements of the cheeks, lips and hands. When a child is confronted with a new object, he or she will try to understand the new object by applying his or her old schema to it. He or she grasps and adapts him or her to a new object by assimilating it. His or her old schema does not change in the process.\n3. Accommodation: Accommodation involves modification or change of some elements of an old schema or learning new schema which is more appropriate for the new object. A baby who has already got a schema of sucking mother's breast accommodates to the object placed in the mouth - finger, nipple, pencil, a toy-depending on its shape, form and the size. The baby develops a new schema or a modified schema. This is called accommodation. Thus, a baby assimilates when he or she understands and perceives the new in the light of his or  her  old  perceptions. A  baby  forms a new schema and modifies orchanges his old perception to suit the new. This implies adjusting or accommodating. In this way, a baby forms new structures or new schemes, and consequently develops cognitivity.\n4. Equilibration: The structures or the schemes change from one stage to another by the process of equilibration-maintaining balance between the child and his or her changing environment. According to Piaget, when by the existing scheme, the new situation is not fully handled, then a state of disequilibrium or an imbalance between what is understood and what is encountered is created. In such a case, the individual tries to reduce such imbalances. This is done by him or her by focusing his or her attention on the stimuli that has caused the disequilibrium and by developing new schemas or adapting old ones until equilibrium is restored. This process of restoring balance is called equilibration. Piaget believes that learning depends on this process."

    "context_enriched_content": "8.2.1 Piaget's Stages of Intellectual Development\nPiaget proposed four stages of cognitive or intellectual development which reflect the increasing sophistication of children's thought. These stages are as follows:\n1.   Sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years of age)\n2.   Pre-operational stage (from 2 years to 7 years)\n3.   Concrete operational stage (from 7years to age 11 years)\n4.   Formal operational stage (age 11+ - adolescence and adulthood)\nEach child goes through these stages of cognitive development in the same sequence which is determined by biological maturation and interaction with the environment. There is a compulsion that no stage can be missed out although, there are individual differences in the rate at which children progress through stages, and some individuals may never attain the later stages. Let us discuss these stages in detail in the following section.\n1.  Sensorimotor Stage (Birth-2 years): This stage is between birth and 2 years of age. In this stage, a child obtains primary experiences through their senses such as touching, tasting, listening, seeing, and sensing. As they progress in age they are able to do more complex physical"

They are able to chase somebody, they are able to put take out their toys from a box and put them back. The developments that take place in this stage include:\n- ( a)  Co-ordinating reflexes\n- ( b) Greater control over body movements\n- ( c) Co-ordinating simple motor actions\nAnother  important  development that takes place during this stage is object permanence. In the initial years of this phase, the infant's thinking is not developed enough to understand that objects continue to  exist  even  if  he  cannot  see  or  sense  them.  Language  also  starts developing during this age. From the first babbling to the first signs of language, appear but they more significantly develop in the next stage. It requires the ability to form a mental representation (i.e., a schema) of the object.\n2. Preoperational Stage (2-7 years): The span of this stage is primarily from 2 years to 7 years. During this stage, young children think in symbolic terms. This is the ability to make one thing - a word or an object - stand for something other than itself. The thought process is still in ego centric terms. The mental processes described in sensorimotor stage are clearly developed by this stage. The development proceeds on the basis of these processes. A child cannot mentally imagine doing an action or reversing it which is also known as operations or operational thinking. Since, this second stage comes before development of such thinking, it is known as preoperational. First step in this direction is development of a language system. For example, they can see the picture of an apple and identify it. They become capable of symbolic actions like pretending to drink tea from an empty cup.\n3. Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years): This stage spans from seven years to eleven years. It is considered as the major milestone in the cognitive development because it marks the beginning of logical or operational thought. The learner is oriented towards practicality and applies logic and problem solving thinking in concrete problems. The learner is able to sequence the object on the basis of sequence of their attributes. That is, middle school years. In this phase children become capable of decentering and reversing actions mentally. In short, the child at this age overcomes most of the limitations of the previous stage. That  is,  the  child  gradually  develops  ability  to  understand others perspective (moving ahead from egocentrism). They initiate movement from perceptual or observable towards more symbol based logical thinking, but the thinking is still based on the material world.\nThe ability of reversibility in thinking opens new avenues for learning. Therefore, the system of logic fairly develops to become much more adult-like.\n4. Formal Operational Stage (11 years and over): The  formal operational stage begins at approximately age eleven and lasts into adulthood. During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts, and logically test hypotheses. The mental faculties of  the  learner  are  matured  and  there  is  a  sequence  to  the  thought process. There is an increase in the problem solving capability of the learners. The child is able to comprehend the meaning of symbolic words, analogies and is able to think in abstract terms. They gradually become capable of abstract thinking which means that they can think and engage with symbols (like numbers). Such thinking demands ability for hypothetical (assumptions based), and deductive reasoning"

    "context_enriched_content": "8.2.2 Piaget's Views on the Various Aspects of Learning\nAccording to Piaget, the various aspects of learning are as follows:\n1.   Meaning of learning: Learning includes the wide range of activities. Rigid distinctions such as classroom for instruction, laboratory for practicals,  recess  for  amusement,  and  mathematics  for  developing computational ability and athletics for strengthening the body muscles are unnecessary. Piaget's approachhelps to tie together what have been treated as separate subjects.\n2.   Role of learner's actions: Action stresses the role of active exploration. A child is active when he or she stares at objects. A child is active when he or she stares at an organism. A child is active when he or she studies his or her body parts. A child is active when he or she lifts something. A child is active when he or she carries things. A child is active when he or she arranges things. Children are usually active for mostof their time. There is no doubt that some of these activities may be rather aimless or unnecessary. However, most of these activities are purposeful.\n3.   Role of practice: An important part of Piagetian model is repetition of an act by a child. The role of practice varies with development. Concepts are the products of a long history of action. A child may take three or more days to complete a puzzle. Each day, he or she appears to go through the same sequence. A child's actions upon the environment are repeated again and again with slight modifications each time. Piaget depicts the child as somewhat slower and methodical and systematic in acquisition of new ideas.\n4.   Motivation: According to Piaget, a learner desires to reduce his or her internal conflicts by keeping his or her thoughts harmonious and\nNOTES"

It is only through playing, imitating, exploring and questioning that a child gradually comes to distinguish the achievable from non-achievable, and logical from the illogical. To Piaget, the progress towards this end is inherent, a property of cognitive style as are eating, drinking and breathing in the physiological field.\n5.   Memory: Memory is a symbolic representation of how the child has schematized what he or she sees. Experiments conducted by Piaget reveal that after six months, 61 per cent of the children from 4-8 years of age regressed in their memory ability, if tested by recall or evocation.\n- A  reconstruction  test  involving  the  child  with  some  material showedregression in  4-5  years  old  but  48  per  cent  progression among 6-7 years old. Piaget holds that recognition is perceptual and reconstruction is internalized imitation. Each experiment reveals that the  pattern  of  accuracy,  improvement and regression (Gradual loss of memory) is determined by initial conceptual understanding and is altered by new understandings.\n6.   Interest: According to Piaget, the interest of the child at any given movement depends upon the system of ideas he or she has acquired plus his or her affective perception. A child tends to fulfil his or her interests in the direction of greater equilibrium. According to Piaget, Equilibrium is development and the ability to think in a logical and natural manner."

The role of the teacher is to facilitate learning, rather than direct tuition. Therefore, teachers should encourage the following within the classroom:\n- Focus on the process of learning, rather than the end product of it.\n- Using active methods that require rediscovering or reconstructing 'truth'.\n- Using collaborative, as well as individual activities (so children can learn from each other).\n- Devising  situations  that  present  useful  problems,  and  create disequilibrium in the child.\n- Evaluate the level of the child's development so suitable tasks can be set.\n- Recognition of the crucial role of self involvement in learning activities by the learners.\n- Demphasis on practices aimed at making children think like adults.\n- Acceptance of individual differences in developmental process. Some of the implications are as follows:\n- It  provides a broad development perspective to the educator for building a curriculum for the children.\n- The description of developmental stages and qualitative aspects of intellectual growth is useful in providing suitable educational practices.\n- The cognitive theory states that the child has to be actively involved in the teaching-learning process for his or her intellectual growth.\n- Piaget-based curriculum requires that children should not skip any stage.\n- The pre-school child is at the pre-operational level. The educational program at this stage should provide concrete operations.\n- An educational program should enable the child to integrate the information.\n- A child should be helped to develop internal consistency of the system.\n- Most of the activities of the Piaget type require simple equipment and material.\n- Drilling in skills is to be avoided.\n- Teaching learning situation should be geared to a point where the child is neither too familiar nor too unfamiliar with the objects and ideas.\n- Variety of cognitive activities such as storytelling, rhymes and so on are included in the program in a systematic manner. There is a deliberate attention of developing cognitive growth.\n- A child's development is retarded if he is not allowed a fairly wide sensoryand motor experience in his early years.\n- Real events and concrete objects play an important role in learning.\n- In science and mathematics, learning from physical environment is more important than what is learnt from people, books or television.\n- A teacher should arouse curiosity of the child through planned activities."

According to Gagne (1968), the stages explained by Piaget are not necessarily the inevitable result of an inborn time-table. Rather, it is a consequence of children having learned sets of rules that are progressively more complex and these rules are taught by their physical and social environment. Gagne thinks that Piaget was indifferent to the role of learning in developmental changes.\nSome of the other psychologists also believe that infants are not born with elementary mental structures which are the starting points for their attempts to deal with their environment.\nHis views are not new to educational thought. What is new is that they have been stated in the context of the classroom situations. Instruction in the classroom would serve as the function of setting into motion, the processes of assimilation and accommodation for a particular area of exploration."

The results of intelligence tests show that mental or intellectual growth is rapid in infancy, moderate in childhood and slow in youth.\nSensation and perception : Both sensation and perception are considered important  aspects  of  mental  development.  Senses  are  the  elementary impressions gathered by sense organs. Impressions take the form of perception when they are interpreted and some definite meanings are attached to them.\nThrough experience, child's sensations become perceptions and he or she is able to give meaning to it. Child's sensory equipment becomes mature at the age of five. He or she shows a great interest in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting. However, a child's sensations do not automatically assume meaning. During his or her early childhood, a child is more likely to misrepresent things and objects becauseof lack of experience. For example, when viewed from a distance, a train may appear to a child as a toy train. But gradually a child's perceptions become more and more accurate through the right kinds of experiences. By the time a child enters school, he or she has gained enough experience.\nYet, he or she needs assistance and guidance to improve his or her ability to perceive by having first hand experiences and observations of objects, persons and situations around him or her. Gradually he or she develops a proper perception of space, time, form, movement and distance. Perception patterns become more organized and refined when an individual reaches his or her adolescence. At adolescence, perception patterns tend to become more"

They are beginning to be influenced by an individual's beliefs, ideals, and opinions and so on.\nConcept formation :  Another  important  aspect  of  the  child's  mental development is the acquisition of concept. A concept is the generalized meaning that is attached to an object or idea. It is the result of one's perceptual experiences. It involves both discrimination and generalization.\nDiscrimination begins sometimes after the child tries to generalize his or her perceptual experiences. Thus, he or she begins to acquire concepts. Experience is an important factor in concept formation. In early childhood, a child tries to develop various concepts from the concrete experiences in the form of actual objects.\nNormally, concept formation proceeds from concrete to abstract, from vague to clear and from inexact to exact, depending on the type of experiences a child receives. The child has a very poor concept of time. As stated by psychologists, Crow and Crow, 'Time as such means little to the young child. He or she cannot distinguish among 'today', 'tomorrow', and 'next week' except as they represent words rather than actual duration of time.'\nIn later years, various experiences provided by reading, lecturing and motives help in concept formation. Generally, concepts may be broadened, and developed. They may even take a new shape. Wrong concepts can be altogether abandoned.Gradually as a result of learning and maturation, child's concepts becomes clear, definite and specific.\nDevelopment of language : The development of language contributes to the mental growth and development of the child. Important aspects of language development are speech, vocabulary and length of responses.\nDevelopment of memory : Memory is also an important element of mental development. There is little  memory at birth but it  gradually  increases with maturation and experience. According to psychologists, Hurlock and Schwartz (1932), 'Memory of animpressionistic kind appears in the first half of the year and instances of the true remembrance appear by the end of first year. During the first year, memory is only aroused by sensory stimuli. With the learning of speech, the child is able to remember ideationally by the end of the second year. During the first and second years, the memory is stronger for persons and objects than for situation. In pre-childhood from 3 to 6 years, situations become significant factors in the child memory. The emotional quality of the impressions also influences memory. By age of 3, the child can recount the story heard a few days ago and he can also give information about past experiences.'\nA child has a good memory in the earlier stages but this memory is generally a rote memory. His or her memorization is without reasoning. He or she seldom uses logic and insight in memorization. A child can cram and\nreproduce the matter easily. The memory tends to function more logically during later childhood and adolescence.A selection process of remembering and forgetting  begins  to  operate. After  that  memory  tends  to  decrease. Memory depends upon person to person. It is generally affected by health and situation of the child. The stimuli which are associated with a kind of memory influence significantly, its remembrance or forgetting.\nCreativity : It may be stressed that creativity is the most single ability which is at the root of human progress. Like many other activities, it can be developed at a young age. In a general sense, creativity is the ability to think in novel ways whichresult in some new and original solution.\nProblem solving : All thinking and reasoning involve meeting difficulties, facing complex situations and finding out solutions. An individual is beset with all these since childhood. Thinking and reasoning powers are used in problem solving and these begin to grow as early as two and a half or three years of age. Gradually the ability to reason grows."

The nervous system begins to grow during the prenatalperiod. As the nervous system keeps on growing before and after birth, the process of mental development also goes on accordingly.\n2. Mental development before the age of three : During these years, the process of mental development is much faster. Important characteristics of this stage are:\n- Curiosity\n- Rote memory\n- Creativity\n- Time concept not yet developed\n- Very little development of powers of observation, perception and concentration\n3. Period of pre-school age : During the ages of two and a half or three to six, the mental abilities of the child develop very rapidly. His or her perceptual powers increase and his or her curiosity are aroused to a great extent.\n4.

He or she develops the concepts of length, time and distance and tends to express himself or her in various ways.\n5. Mental development during adolescence :  The  most  crucial  and significant period of an individual's life. It is the period of rapid changes in the individual'sphysical, mental, moral and social outlook.\n6. Mental development during early adulthood : The most important mental  abilities  needed  for  learning  and  for  adjustment  to  new situations, such as recall, reasoning and creative thinking reach their peak during the twenties and men begin a slow and gradual decline.\n7. Mental development and middle ages :  Studies  conducted  by Termanand Oden (1959) on a group of individuals followed from preschool years to middle life have shown that mental decline does not set in during middle ages among those with high intellectual abilities.\n8. Mental development during old age : Old people take more time to integrate their responses. They tend to lack the capacity for or interest in creative thinking. Old people tend to have poor recent memories but better remote memories. There is slight deterioration in vocabulary. The mental rigidity that sometimes sets in during middle age often becomes more pronounced as the person grows older.\n9. Cessation of mental growth : Psychologists have tried to give various ages ranging from thirteen to the early twenties or even much later as the age after which there is no further mental growth. Psychologist Sorenson (1945) has tried to analyse the age of cessation of mental growth. He writes that it is probably safe to conclude that a person reaches his or her maximum mental level at about the age of twenty or perhaps a little before or a little after twenty.\nIt is true that on the average there is only a little mental growth during the late teens, nevertheless, this small amount may be very important."

A scheme is an organized pattern of behaviour which the child develops when he or she is engaged in any activity.\n2.  The  schemes change from one stage to another by the process of equilibration-maintaining balance between the child and his or her changing environment. According to Piaget, when by the existing scheme,  the  new  situation  is  not  fully  handled,  then  a  state  of disequilibrium or an imbalance between what is understood and what is encountered is created.\n3.  Concrete operational stage is considered as the most important stage in cognitive development because it marks the beginning of logical or operational thought. The learner is oriented towards practicality and applies logic and problem solving thinking in concrete problems. The learner is able to sequence the object on the basis of sequence of their attributes.\n4.  A concept is the generalized meaning that is attached to an object or idea.

There are various abilities that need to be developed among children. Concepts are defined as the representations of perceptual or sensory experience, or combinations of such experiences that an individual experiences during his or her childhood.\nIt  becomes  important  to  understand  that  acquisition  of  object, understanding  and  building  up  of  an  immense  strong  foundation  of understanding the concepts is an essential domain. There is an innate need of developing imagination, creativity among children so that the children are able to think logically and with reasoning. There are various methods, strategies and activities  that  the  teachers  and  parents  can  conduct  for  developing imagination among children. There are various developmental activities for developing cognition power of the child. This is of great importance that identification and understanding of concepts builds up the foundation of the child.\nIn this unit, the development of concepts and stages involved in the process of concepts has been discussed. The importance of creative faculties in a child's life and the various ways in which these can be developed has been explained. The unit will also help one to analyse the process of developing moral skills and the importance of aesthetic standards. The ways in which cognitive development can be developed has been highlighted."

The child has to not only identify the relevant part of the situation being labeled, but also isolate a concept at the correct level of abstraction which involves reasoning and critical thinking. Infants learning their first words begin with a strong conceptual foundation of the words\nConcept development refers to the basic understanding that is necessary to make sense of one's world. It includes ideas about the self and others, objects, and the environment. Concepts provide an efficient way of organizing experience and facts. Concepts are used by children and adults to extend the  known information to previously unknown cases through a process called inductive  inference .  Such  inferences  are  not  based  on  perceptual similarity alone.\nSome of the general strategies that can be helpful in assisting children who are deaf or blind to develop concepts are enlisted as follows:\n- Use activities that are meaningful to the child\n- Use activities that the child enjoys\n- Attach language to all experiences\n- Build on language that is already known to the child\n- Use a total communication approach that is appropriate for the child\n- Remove variables that may cause confusion for the child\n- Generalize the concepts to a variety of situations.\nNOTES\nAcquisition\nNOTES"

This is described in different stages by Piaget. In stage 1, he proposed that the object concept develops slowly and gradually in infancy in. In stage 2,  an  object  disappears the baby continues to look to the location where it disappeared and does not search. In stage 3, infants can now anticipate objects visually and can visually search for an object if he or she drops it out of sight will search for partially hidden but not for completely hidden objects. In stage 4, infants search for hidden objects but even now they are not able to understand that an object is something that exists in-and-of-itself. Rather, the object is still part-and-parcel of the action used to find the object. This is important to be developed among children so that they are able to recognize the objects and achieve object permanence."

Imagination  fosters  cognitive  and social development in an individual. In early childhood education, critical thinking skills and creative problem-solving abilities are goals for children's development. In imagination, the child learns to try new ways of doing things, and experimenting helps to develop critical thinking in children and foster creative problem solving. Imagination and creativity are also skills that our children need in their daily lives at present and future."

With various activities to be done in an outdoor platform, it inspires child to think, question, make suppositions,\nmake alterations and develop creative mind and overall imagination. Children can be engaged in different activities such as to draw in sand, make designs with twigs, build forts with branches, or simply lie on the ground and look up at the sky\n- Simulations: Engage the child in simulation situations where the child has to be in different roles and so this may enhance the creativity in child.  Let your child lead your playtime together. If the child performs in different situations, he or she will have to think himself or herself in different situations, think of the decisions he or she may have to take and react in different situations.\n- Verbal activities: The child can be engaged in verbal activities involving practice from rhymes to riddles, silly sounds to phonics, games or making up lyrics to common tunes. These verbal interactive activities can inspire and nurture creative minds by enhancing their vocabulary. Simultaneously, these activities build vocabulary and help the child to learn phonics by identifying 'te' sounds of the words and then imagining them to speak in front of everyone. These games are also the perfect and fun way to spend time in car rides.\n- Encourage art and craft activities: Art is a creative expression that nurtures imagination, not a lesson in following directions. Through activities such as painting, collage, clay work, drawing or any other medium, art is an efficient way for children to work through emotions, make decisions, and express their ideas and be imaginative to the core. Such activities develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination and boosts confidence. Furthermore, art activities build confidence because children gain a sense of mastery over materials resulting in a new creation.\n- Ask open-ended and thought-provoking questions to children: Asking questions that provoke imaginative and creative thinking is an effective way to identify the ability of the child to express his or her ideas and share his or her visions and also enhance his or her logical reasoning while giving him or her the message that his or her ideas are important and the way of expressing them is also important as only having them in the mind.\n- Limit the time provided to child for television, movies, computer and video games: It  is  primarily done so that the child should not be always engrossed in media related activities. This is evident that continuous watching TV and other media related activities, the child's mind gets blocked and ceases to think creatively because it is always preoccupied with media shows or video games. Nurturing imagination and parenting in the digital age can be tough. Focusing on a screen is a passive way of learning for children. An alternative would be to\nNOTES\nAcquisition"

Engaging children in a kinesthetic manner using their entire bodies and their five senses also opens the mind.\nImaginative play and drama based activities enable children to explore the  world  around  them and the people in it.   Imagination also develops neurological connections in pupil's brain from moving around and using their senses and muscles. Delving into imaginative worlds based on the experiences that they see around them helps young pupils to make sense of their reality and learn how to communicate with others. Imagination caters the development of the child's basic skills. It has a great impact on their understanding and learning. With that being said, we should encourage our children to continue to practice their imagination and creativity from childhood only. We should be around them to help them identify and understand the situation or things correctly. We should not hold them back. Instead, we should allow them to discover more, explore and learn. We should let their imagination grow to prepare them to the bigger challenge in life.\nIndeed, educators are using pretend games to teach math and reading (Clements, &Sarama, 2009; Ginsburg, 2006). Children play imaginatively and creatively in various different ways based on many factors such as age and play environment. Children can engage in imaginative and creative play by themselves or with others.\nImaginary play happens when children use their imaginations to create pretend and make-believe scenarios expected to where they are engaged in this type of play using small toy figures, puppets, and stuff toys for example. Or children can act out a particular role themselves and become a part of a play drama or simulation so that they develop their creativity and imagination.  Arts and crafts, and construction or building play are different ways for children to express their creativity, encourages focus and concentration, and develops fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination. It also allows children to feel proud of themselves and gain a sense of mastery after they have created something."

In the first stage of this level, people behave according to socially acceptable norms because they are told to do so by some authority like figure (for example, parent or teacher). The second stage of this level is characterized by a view that right behavior means acting in one's own best interests. In this the child learns to understand the actions that are suitable for his or her own interests in different situations. The second level of moral thinking is that generally found in society, hence the name 'conventional'. The third level of moral thinking is one that Kohlberg felt is not reached by the majority of adults because of its nature i.e. following the universal ethical principles that should be ideally followed. The fourth level of moral thinking is that of law and order morality where the child develops sense of what is correct by law morality and order. The last stage (stage 6) is based on respect for universal principle and the demands of individual conscience. Thus, according to Kohlberg, it was important to present them with moral dilemmas for discussion which would help them to see the reasonableness of a higher stage morality and encourage their development in that direction. He saw this as one of the ways in which moral development can be promoted through formal education. Kohlberg believed, that most moral development among individuals usually occurs through social interaction.\nAccording to authors, Breckenridge, M E and Vicent E. in Child Development in  1943  pointed  out  these  things  that  are  needed  for  moral development:\n- Emotional security, tendency to get affection and respect of others.\nNOTES\nAcquisition\nAcquisition"

Aesthetic development is important because it enhances the imaginative and creative power of the child. Artistic formalism is the view that the artistically relevant properties of an artwork-the properties in virtue of which it is an artwork and in virtue of which it is a good or bad one-are formal merely, where formal properties are typically regarded as properties graspable by sight or by hearing merely. Artistic formalism has been taken to follow from both the immediacy and the disinterest theses (Binkley 1970, 266-267; Carroll 2001, 20-40). Teachers can conduct many activities for developing aesthetics among children such as encouraging students to form groups and indulge in arts, writing compositions and drama. Psychologist, Ognjenović (1997) defined aesthetic experience as a special kind of subject-object relationship in which a particular object strongly engages the subject's mind, shadowing all other surrounding objects and events. Throughout the process of aesthetic education, the teacher must master various types of knowledge, abilities and evaluation criteria, which will help them to differentiate: the beautiful from the non-beautiful, the aesthetically valuable from the non-valuable and artistically valuable work from non-valuable work. In this way, the child will be able to develop the foundations for judging and evaluating the beautiful. The teacher should provide opportunities to children for developing aesthetic abilities among them. There should be regular encouragement and reinforcement to develop aesthetic ability of the children."

Both parents and caregivers can support preschool cognitive development by playing symbolic games with their children. Taking part in imaginary play with a preschooler helps them develop their natural curiosity about the world, understanding the necessary things to understand which are symbolic of anything. These activities also invoke their problem solving skills and helps develop their focus and attention as well.\nDuring the preschool years, children undergo a period of rapid brain development. Parents and teachers can help maximize this period of brain development by supporting children with certain types of experience and activities, as well as encouraging children to pursue interests and play that come naturally to them. These activities lead them to identify, understand, learn, interpret and symbolically reflect on various situations through which they undergo from their childhood to adulthood.\nSome play ideas to support the child's cognitive development are as follows:\n- Play simple board games like 'Snakes and ladders' with the child, or simple card games.\n- Read books and tell jokes and riddles.\n- Encourage building and construction games.\n- Do simple jigsaw puzzles.\n- Play games that combine moving and singing - for example, 'If you're happy and you know it'.\n- Encourage the  child  to  help  in  different  activities  at  home. Preschoolers can learn a lot from measuring, counting and naming healthy ingredients for family meals.\n- Encourage reasoning among children.\n- Ask them open-ended questions.\nLearning by doing is best at this age. The child will learn faster if the teacher provides encouragement and support from the sidelines. However, it is important to consider the fact that one must not try and jump to conclusions. The child will let the guardian know if he needs help, so follow his lead."

Language has mainly two functions, first it serves as a tool to express oneself and the other is to communicate. '...language is not complete in any speaker; it exists only within a collectivity...only by virtue of a sort of contract signed by members of a community' (de Saussure, 1966, p. 14).

Interpretative Function: The interpretative function serves to restore a state of cognitive equilibrium. While the stimulus itself creates a condition of uncertainty, the interpretation serves to clarify the situation and restore equilibrium.\n2. Control Function: When one talks of the function of control, there emerges a social dimension apart from the individual differences.\n3. Social Function: Language is required for developing social relations among individuals. It is used to build social relations with others.\n4. Creative Function: Language plays an important role in developing imaginative and creative activity.\nTo understand and use a language effectively, children must master four basic components of the language. First, they must master phonology: They must know how words sound and be able to produce the sequence of sounds that make up any given word. Second, they must master semantics, the meanings of a large number of words. Third, they must have a good command of syntax, rules for how words can legitimately be combined to form understandable phrases and sentences. Finally, children must master the pragmatics of language, the use of social conventions and speaking strategies that  enable  effective  communication  with  others.

Children often begin reproducing the words that they are repetitively exposed to. The method in which we develop language skills is universal. Language development is a process wherein the infant learns to babble, learn letters, words, sentences, combination of words in sentences, and development of listening, speaking, reading and writing skill. Children's language development, one of the important and interesting issues in the psychology of language. Psychologist, Dickinson (2001) study of seven-year-old children, the students interact with teachers and students interact with parents, playing with other children, talking with them, reading to them by teachers and parents as important factors for growth Language.\nThe two most important skills in describing the development of language in children are receptive skill and expressive skill. The receptive language skill is always in advance of the expressive language skill. The development of receptive skill begins at birth when the newly born infant is immediately exposed to all different kinds of noises. At first infant cannot distinguish between the sounds, but after approximately six to eight weeks, he or she is able to recognize the differences between a human voice and other noises. This voice is usually his or her mother's voice and the infant may show recognition by a facial expression such as a smile. By nine months he or she begins to respond to a few simple words: very often the names of  toys  or  teddy  bear. At  this  time  he  or  she  may  respond  by  gesture  or movement. By twelve months infant can usually respond commands (Stork and Widdowson, 1974). As psychologists, Stork and Widdowson (1974) propose the development of the expressive language skill is the beginning of active participation in speech and language. At this stage, the infant can respond vocally to pain, such as hunger, pleasure and satisfaction, but these are just reflexes. The development of speech indeed begins when infant can produce sounds at will by conscious effort. This kind of sound production is known as babbling which begins towards the end of the third month of life. At this stage, child produces only a limited number of sounds. By about six months, he or she is producing a wide range of sounds and is using them in his or her play. By nine months, he or she is capable of responding to simple words. At this stage, he or she learns to repeat the same sound or sounds over\nand over again. The child usually produces a syllable consisting of consonant plus vowel which is often called 'reduplication stage'. The child will begin to use his or her first words at about twelve months. The forms such as mama or dada, which occur very early during the reduplication stage, are not considered as words. Reduplicating syllables consisting of bilabial or alveolar consonants and low front vowels are used in many languages as children's names for parents. At about the same time child begins to use a few recognizable words which he or she invents for himself or herself which are called Jargon. The development of jargon is an important stage in the acquisition of language (Stork &Widdowson, 1974: 135). When the child is about eighteen months he or she will be using perhaps about twenty meaningful words and a great number of jargons. At this stage his or her communication with others is limited to single word utterance. The development of words into sentences is indeed the true beginning of grammar. This occurs at about twenty four month old and at first it is limited to the juxtaposition of two words and then gradually develops into more complex sentences. A child usually acquires most of the grammatical forms of native language by five or six years old (Kess, 1993).\nLanguage acquisition is seen as having certain cognitive prerequisites or co-requisites. That is, the child will not develop linguistic forms before acquiring the cognitive bases for those forms. For example, the child is expected to learn where question/location answer prior to the when-question/ time answer because the concept of place is acquired prior to the concept of time, and this order is cognitively determined. Psychologist, Kess (1993:305) also discuss that a form which is linguistically simple may be conceptually difficult. Like Kess, Slobin (1973) also suggests that conceptual development proceeds grammatical development and determines the acquisition of order of some grammatical forms."

Children  learn  a language, not because they are subjected to a similar conditioning process, but because they possess an inborn capacity which permits them to acquire a language as a normal maturational process. This capacity is universal. The child has an innate language acquiring device. He or she learns a language by exposure to it in society and by unconsciously forming certain hypothesis about language, which he or she goes on modifying till he or she comes to the adult model to which he or she is for the most part exposed. So, the child goes on constructing an innate grammar, operating over generalized rules. The capacity for acquiring language is remarkable a number of reasons (Langacker, 1973:12-13).\nLanguage acquisition is a process whereby children achieve a fluent control of their native language (Varshney, 2003:307).

According to psychologist, Chomsky (2009:101-102) language acquisition is a matter of growth and maturation of relatively fixed capacities, under appropriate external conditions. The form of acquisition and use of language is  acquired  is  largely  determined  by  internal  factors;  it  is  because  of  the fundamental correspondence of all human languages, because of the fact that 'human beings are the same, wherever they may be', that a child can learn any language. Language acquisition at age 1-3 years old occurs naturally. It is meant that a child is insensibly acquiring the language but the fact he or she can produce the language for communication. The process of acquiring the language at the age before 5 years old is known as 'Golden age'. This period show the progress of language development from one stage to another. The functioning of the language capacity is, furthermore, optimal at a certain 'critical period' of intellectual development. In addition to that, the term, 'language acquisition' is normally used without qualification for the process which results in the knowledge of one's native language (or native languages). Language development is enriched by verbal interactions with other children and adults. Parents and care-givers can have a significant impact on early language development.\nLanguage acquisition is the process of building the ability to understand a language, using it to communicate with others. In the sense of first language acquisition, however, it refers to the acquisition (unconscious learning) of one›s native language (or languages in the case of bilinguals) during the first 6 or 7 years of one›s life (roughly from birth to the time one starts school). Language acquisition for any generation of children consists of achieving mastery in four main areas, i.e. acquiring. The following are the four main areas related to acquisition of language:\n1.  A set of syntactic rules which specify how sentences are built up out of phrases and phrases out of words.\n2.  A set of morphological rules which specify how words are built up out of morphemes, i.e. grammatical units smaller than the word.\n3.  A set of phonological rules which specify how words, phrases and sentences are pronounced.\n4.  A set of semantic rules which specify how words, phrases and sentences are interpreted, i.e. what their meaning is.\nThe process of language development can be divided into three main broad categories:\n1.  A stage where the child acquires an ability to produce or make speech sounds and utterances.\n2.  The ability to comprehend, understand and interpret.\n3.  The ability to actively communicate through adult level language."

In the early language responses, the child is able to understand the  language  to  others  before  he  or  she  starts  saying  the  words  himself or  herself.  The  child  from  infancy  starts  to  develop  general  vocabulary where the child first learns the easiest and most useful words.

At around the age of one and half years, infant's language consists of one word sentences, by the age of two and half years, most students speak in full sentence. The child's pronunciation also improves after the age of 18 months and the child learns to speak, read and write language.

Physical Health : If there are physical weaknesses in children such as defects in vocal organs or any difficulty in developing language. Illness  can  effect  hearing  which, in turn, will cause problems with understanding  spoken  language  or  other  auditory  cues.  Hearing problems can, in turn, effect speech development. Children who are ill also lack enthusiasm to speak and communicate non-verbally. This can hinder development of language and communication. In addition to illness, physical development can influence language. Vocal cords and speech related facial muscles must be developed in order for a child to orally communicate effectively. Fine motor skills are also necessary to write or draw letters and symbols.\n2. Family :  A family's influence such as efforts in developing the language abilities  of  the  child  determines  the  child's  language  habits.  The exposure that a family provides to the child helps in determining his or her interest in language, speaking, reading and communication.parents' monitoring of language interactions with children differs according to their socioeconomic status. Moreover, parents also appear to influence children in different ways. Children whose mothers reported that they frequently read to them, went to the library and puppet theater or cinema, were involved in the process of joint reading, and stimulated their reading and learning of the letters, and guided them to the zone of  proximal development achieved higher scores on the Language Development Scale and told more coherent stories with a textless picture book (Fekonja, Podlesek, & Umek, 2005). The environment that a child is exposed to and the involvement that child's parents give them while at home impact their language development.\n3. Environmental Influence: There are various environmental influences that  determine  the  gradual  development  of  language  development. Children who are spoken to and read to are more likely to want to speak and learn to read. Social environment can be a hindrance to language development when there is a lack of example on which children can base their understanding of language and all that it entails.\n4. Cognitive Ability :  It  has  been  suggested  that  there's  a  correlation between intelligence and early speech. Children who pick up on the language early show an increased level of cognitive development. They tend to develop early use of proper sentence structure and strong vocabulary. It should be noted, however, that children who are slow to develop language skills are not necessarily slow cognitively, as there may be other factors at play.\n5. Motivation : If a child has no desire to communicate or understand the world around her or him, there will be a lack of language development. Until he sees the value and need for use of the language, development may be slow."

In Skinner's view, when infants make a variety of speech sounds in a seemingly random fashion, adults respond favorably to-and so encourage children to repeat-only those sounds used in the local language. The behaviourist theory believes that 'infants learn oral language from other human role models through a process involving imitation, rewards, and practice. Human role  models in an infant'senvironment provide the stimuli and rewards'. (Cooter&Reutzel, 2004).\nThe behaviourist theory believes that 'infants learn oral language from other human role models through a process involving imitation, rewards, and practice. Human role models in an infant's environment provide the stimuli and rewards (Cooter&Reutzel, 2004)'. Skinner argued that children learn language based on behaviourist reinforcement principles by associating words with meanings. Correct utterances are positively reinforced when the child realizes the communicative value of words and phrases.\nThe behaviourist B F Skinner then proposed this theory as an explanation for language acquisition in humans. In Verbal Behaviour (1957), he stated:\nThe basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modifications. (Cited in Lowe and Graham, 1998, p68)\nThe following are the main features of behaviourist theory:\n1.  Behaviourist  theory  dwells  on  spoken  language.  Learning language is primarily what is spoken and secondarily what is written.\n2.  Behaviourist  theory  is  the  habit  formation  theory  of  language teaching and learning, reminding us the learning of structural grammar. Language learning concerns us by 'not problem-solving but the information and performance of habits'.\n3.  All  learning  is  the  establishment  of  habits  as  the  result  of reinforcement and rewards, positive reinforcement is reward, and negative reinforcement is punishment. Therefore, language can be learnt through the process of reinforcement where the child is reinforced on every effort he or she makes to learn language. When the child is motivated by rewards, he or she does positive effort in regard to learning language.\nOverview of Language Development\nNOTES\nOverview of Language Development"

It depends on many factors that the individual differences occur among individuals. There are many strategies to develop vocabulary among children.\nThe role of teachers and parents is of immense importance in developing vocabulary among children. Moreover, there are different four different language skills that are to be developed among individuals. There are different speech impairments too which hampers the personality of the child.\nIn this unit, the meaning and causes of individual differences have been discussed. The various strategies related to learning and the ways of promoting language skills in children are highlighted.

DeCeeceo,  'The  psychology  of  individual differences is largely the study of group differences. This study classifies individuals by age, traits, sex, race, social class and so on, and observes the differences within and between those groups. Physical, mental, social and cultural differences etc. are being studied, under individual differences'."

    "context_enriched_content": "Causes of Individual Differences\nThe following are the main causes of individual differences:\n1. Heredity: The chief cause of individual differences is heredity and an individual's inherit various physical traits such as face with its features, colour of eyes and hair, type of skin and size of hands, colour blindness and tendency to certain diseases , mental traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and aptitude. It is an admitted fact that heredity differences result in the quantity and rate of physical as well as mental development indifferent individuals.\n2. Environment: The  second  most  important  cause  of  individual differences. Environment significantly influences individual differences among children. Owing to the environment, changes in a child's environment are reflected in the changes in his or her personality.\n3. Environment consists of physical, intellectual, social, moral, political, economic and cultural  forces,  all  these  forces  cause  individual differences.\n4. 3 .   Influence of caste, race and nation: Individuals of different castes and races exhibit very marked differences among individuals. There is a wide effect of caste and race on the personality of the individual because of the cultural influence. Similarly individuals of different nations show differences in respect of their personality, character and mental abilities. These are the outcome of their geographical, social and cultural environment.\nOverview of Individual Difference in Acquisition of Language\nNOTES\nOverview of Individual Difference in Acquisition of Language"

Between the age of 11 and 14, girls are taller and heavier than the boys. Girls are kind, affectionate, sympathetic and tender while the boys are brave, hard, efficient and competent.\n5. Age and intelligence: Another important factor that causes individual difference among individuals are physical, intellectual and emotional development. Many individuals differ because of the differences in intelligence. Individuals who are below the average in intelligence and mental age find much difficulty in learning and the average intelligent persons can learn quickly.\n6. Temperament  and  emotional  stability: Another  cause  is  that some people are by temperament active and quick, while others are passive and slow, some humorous and others short tempered. It has been observed that emotional stability of the individual is differently affected by physical, mental and environmental factors. Differences in emotional stability cause individual differences.\n7. Economic condition and education: Individual differences are caused by economic condition of the parents and the education of the children. There is  a  wide  difference  among  the  individuals  with  economic differences. It is not possible for the children of two economic classes to have a similarity and equality.\n8. Other  Causes: There  are  various  other  causes  such  as  interests, aptitudes, achievements, sentiments, character, and educational and home background lead to individual differences."

    "context_enriched_content": "Relationship of Individual Differences with Education:\nOne of the important objectives of  modern education is  the  complete development of the individual. Individuals have different goals, different interests, different emotional problems and different abilities. Since, school work is planned on group basis it presents a formidable challenge to all teachers.\nIndividual differences in processing speed are correlated with individual differences  in  intelligence  and  working  memory  (Jensen,  1998),  and to individual differences in basic verbal (Hunt, Lunneborg, and Lewis, 1975) and quantitative abilities (Geary and Widaman, 1987, 1992).\nTeaching plays  roles  such  as  guiding,  facilitating  learning,  and encouraging the learner and setting the conditions for learning. Having a good understanding of how the learner learns will help teachers to determine their philosophy of education, their teaching style, approach, methods, and classroom techniques. It is imperative for the teachers to understand the\nindividual differences. According to Cook (2001), 'the proof of teaching is in the learning', and 'all successful teaching depends upon learning'.\nThe role of learner as negotiator-between the self, the learning process, and the object of learning-emerges from and interacts with the role of joint negotiator within the group and within the classroom procedures and activities which the group undertakes. The implication for the learner is that he or she should contribute as much as he or she gains, and thereby, learn in an interdependent way. Students' interdependence is considered important in student-centered learning approaches. Students are expected to interact with each other, rather than with teachers (Richards, 2001). To acquire this capacity, students need to have confidence, high motivation and positive attitudes toward their study (Liu and Zhang, 2007). Therefore, learner autonomy and motivation are important factors for successful teaching and learning.\nLanguage  development  has  long  been  associated  with  motor development,  particularly  manual  gesture.  Variations  in  rate  within components of early language are also symbolic of individual differences. Having large-scale  variation  in  rate  of  development  within  individual components, there is developmental asynchrony between comprehension and production, and between lexical production and grammar of the individual.\nThere are variations in learning style among children. Continuing our search for the seams and joints of the language processor, it is observed that humans differ from each other due to many biological or conditioned factors (affected by nature) or unconscious forces (affected by past experiences). The many ways in which one learns about these differences that are usually similar, through introspection and interaction with other people, or by reading books and watching television or any form of media. However, in order to conduct research in individual differences, it is necessary to have rigorous instruments, and a scientific way of providing reliable and valid.\nIt is believed that there is a critical period for first language acquisition in children. Children are believed to have only a limited number of years during which normal acquisition is possible. Beyond that, physiological changes cause the brain to lose its capacity to assume the new functions that learning language demands. Individuals who for some reasons are deprived of the linguistic input which is needed to trigger first language acquisition during the  critical  period  will  never  learn  any  language  normally.  Psychologist, Zhuanglin (1989) highlighted that, it was generally believed that male and female are born with different linguistic advantages, such as, female learn to speak earlier than male, and female learn a foreign language faster and better than male.\nLanguage learning styles refer to cognitive variations in learning a second language. It is about an individuals' preferred way of processing, that is, of perceiving, conceptualizing, organizing, and recalling information\nOverview of Individual Difference in Acquisition of Language\nNOTES\nOverview of Individual Difference in Acquisition of Language\nNOTES\nrelated to language learning. According to psychologist, Cornett (1983) the language learning styles are the overall patterns that give general direction to learning behavior. Psychologist, Brown (2000) states that unlike factors of age, aptitude, and motivation, its role in explaining why some L2 learners are more successful than others has not been well established, it involves a complex (and as yet poorly understood) interaction with specific L2 social and learning contexts. He also argued that the choice of learning strategies is  strongly  influenced  by  the  nature  of  their  motivation,  cognitive  style, and personality, as well as by specific contexts of use and opportunities for learning.\nThere are individual differences found in an individual but it identifies differences in social, cognitive, cultural, and linguistic dimensions. These dimensions determine the extent of the individual differences that  are significant in identifying the individual differences in the children."

    "context_enriched_content": "Relationship of Individual Differences with Education:\nIt was once thought that all children acquire language in pretty much the same way (Lenneberg, 1964). Although some children develop a little quicker than others, the stages of development and strategies used to acquire language are nearly similar. Psychologist, Nelson (1973) has mentioned two different strategies for acquiring first language; (1) referential strategy, and (2) expressive strategy. She asserts that most children approach language using a referential  strategy. That  is,  they  refer  to  aspects  of  their  immediate environment. In contrast, some children use expressive strategy in which they emphasize social interaction.\nIn referential strategy, children seem to regard language as a process of naming objects whereas expressive children are believed to have more diverse vocabularies such as social routines which are learnt holistically as units. They can also utter whole sentences rather than putting words together one by one and then making sentences.\nThe differences might have linguistic, social, cognitive, and cultural dimension. Languages differ in what is easier and what harder to learn and master. Psychologist, Slobin (1985) distinguished two sources of complexity for learning: conceptual and formal complexity.\nConceptual complexity belongs to the complexity of the ideas being expressed in language; therefore, formal complexity refers to the forms different concepts get. For example, the concept of plural may take different forms in different languages. Although no one language appears to be easier to learn and master, there are some forms which are easier to learn than in other languages. Children growing up in that language find that aspect of language easier and therefore, learn it much sooner than children of other languages in different age.\nMost of the scholars believe that the way children learn language follows a specific pattern and is inherently systematic in its nature. It is definite\nthat children must be exposed to some language in order to start acquisition, but how that exposure and later interaction occur is to some extent variable. The evidence made by children who have grown up in the wild and isolated children those who have grown up with extremely limited human contact proved the importance of language input and child exposure to language.\nFactors such as age, aptitude, motivation, learning and personality determine differences among children.\nPsychologist, Bond (2002), in her research on successful language learners, is more accurate in stating the factors that may aid one's language learning and draws more detailed perspective: (1) age, (2) exposure to foreign language in infancy, (3) immersion, (4) intelligence, (5) personality, (6) attitude and motivation, (7) relationship between first and target language, (8) sensory style, the study on Reflections on English Language Teaching , ZhengdongGan and Todesco (1978) noted that adult good language learners appeared to use five significant strategies: (a) taking an active approach to the task of language learning, (b) recognizing and exploiting the systematic nature of language, (c) using the language they were learning for communication and interaction, (d) managing their own affective difficulties with language learning,  and  (e)  monitoring  their  language  learning  performance.  Such early good language learner research aims at unearthing 'the secrets of such learners,  with  the  implicit  assumption  that  if  these  secrets  became  more widely known, they could be shared with or transplanted to less successful language learners' (Oxford & Lee, 2008, p. 306)."

Vocabulary is central to English language teaching because without sufficient vocabulary students cannot understand others or express their own ideas.

Teaching vocabulary helps students understand and communicate with others in English.\nNation (2001) stated that meaning encompasses the way that form and meaning work together, in other words, the concept and what items it refers to, and the associations that come to mind when people think about a specific word or expression.\nVocabulary development is a vital part of each students' life. It affects his thoughts, actions, aspirations, and often his or her success. There are many ways of building vocabulary among children and one of the best ways for children to build their vocabulary skills is through the method of drill and practice, i.e. repetition of the vocabulary. That means that they see the words repeatedly in a variety of contexts to help them practice using the word, reading the word, and even spelling the word, until they are able to memorize and apply the word in meaningful situations.\nEarly language and communication skills are crucial for children's success in school and beyond. Language and communication skills include the ability to understand others (i.e., receptive language) and express oneself (i.e.,  expressive  language)  using  words,  gestures,  or  facial  expressions. Children who develop strong language and communication skills are more likely to arrive at school ready to learn. The children also are less likely to have difficulties learning to read and are more likely to have higher levels of achievement in school. V ocabulary teaching activities also benefits for literacy development among children as identifying sounds in words promotes the development of decoding skills and identifying the meaning of words which helps in reading comprehension.\nWhen learning the meaning of a word, most learners may find it quite difficult, word meaning, the fixed meaning assumption, and the fuzzy meaning assumption. The fixed meaning assumption claims that for every word there exists a basic meaning, and when learners acquire the basic meaning of a word, the core of the word is acquired. Unlike the fixed meaning viewpoint, the fuzzy meaning viewpoint argues that word cannot have a fixed meaning (Aitchison 2003: 41-52). Students learn some of their vocabulary when their teacher 'teaches' new words directly in the classroom, for example, using explanation, demonstration and even translation. It is also known that students learn  some  of  their  vocabulary  indirectly  through  incidental  encounters with words, for example, by inferring the meaning of a new word from the context.  Unfortunately, little  empirical  evidence  exists  about  the  relative contributions of direct and indirect vocabulary learning. As learners get to know the vocabulary items in greater depth, the closer they move towards productive knowledge. Research (e.g. Oxford, 1990) suggests that language learning strategies (LLSs) influence the outcome of language learning (e.g. Gu and Johnson, 1996; Gu, 2010), and that VLS use, specifically, can enhance vocabulary learning generally (e.g. Schmitt, 1997). There are a number of\nparental language factors that may contribute to vocabulary learning in young dual language learners. For example, the structural hypothesis of language acquisition suggests that parent input that is slightly more complex than the child's language output promotes growth in child language (Cross, 1977; Weistuch& Brown, 1987; Yoder & Warren, 1993). Learning strategies are, defined by psychologists, Chamot and Kupper (1989) as 'techniques which students use to comprehend, store, and remember information and skills'.\nVocabulary has been gradually recognized as crucial to language use in which insufficient vocabulary knowledge of the learners led to difficulties in second language learning. There are many ways of developing vocabulary among children that are practiced by teachers and school authorities. There are many literary and co-curricular activities that are organized by the school teachers to enhance the vocabulary of the children. These help to diagnose the  problems encountered by children for adequate minimum number of vocabulary expected by children."

This can be achieved by using a simple diagram containing various questions to focus on the meanings and sounds of words. The more this strategy is used in the classroom, the more it will become an independent word learning strategy for the pupil.\n3.   Make abstract language visual/concrete where possible. For example, for the words hard/soft-encourage feeling the objects and sorting them according to texture.\n4.  Use additional questions to support word storage. Ask the pupil to use the word in a sentence- when talking, perhaps in partner work.\n5.   Encourage the pupil to think of alternative words in everyday activities.\n6.  Give the pupil, plenty of opportunities to use the new word in real life situations. Model the word and continue discussing it where possible to securely anchor it in their minds.\n7.

There are many activities or teaching strategies through which teachers should promote language skills, such as conducting role play, rewriting the sentences, language games and motivation for children's development of language. These skills are related to each other as listening skill affects speaking skill. There are various strategies that can be practiced for developing language skills such as teachers can conduct language games, pronunciation drill in classrooms. As all the four skills are inter-related to each other, it is observed that when one skill is enhanced it leads to another skill development in an individual. There are various methods and strategies that teacher uses to develop the language skills of the child. These techniques are as follows:\n1.  Incorporating a communicative approach of teaching in classroom.\n2.  Encourage all children to participate in language related activities.\n3.  Boost self-confidence of the child so that the child is able to speak, write and understand the language in a set pattern.\n4.

Owing to the various causes, there are different forms of speech problems. These are briefly described as follows:\n- 1  .  Stuttering: In  stuttering,  the  child  pronounces  the  same  letter repeatedly. Around 2 to 3 years of age, it is very common for children to stutter at the beginning of a sentence. This normal stuttering can take\nthe form of repeating the first sound or syllable in a word or the first word in a sentence. It is more likely to happen when a child is tired, excited, or in a competitive situation, such as trying to express herself better or faster than her peers.\n2.   Lisping: Lisping  is  another  common articulation problem which a young child faces when they are learning to talk.  In this, the child finds it difficult to pronounce certain letters and words. The main cause is the continuity of the infantile mode of speech. Preschoolers typically make substitutions of an easy sound for one that is more challenging for them to make, such as 'th' for 's,' causing them to say 'thand' for 'sand'. So there are many mispronunciations that occur in children because of speech deformities.\n3.   Lengthy pauses : Another speech imperfection is the appearance of long pauses between words or thoughts in children. This is a sign that a child is groping for the correct word or thinking about how to structure her next sentence.\n4.   Slurring : Slurring is caused by running words together during speech in individuals. The speech of speech interferes with distinct pronunciation. This disables the child to pronounce correctly. These can be caused by defect in vocal organs inherited in birth which are very difficult to cure. There are other many reasons that inhibit this, that can be cured. There are many therapies that are conducted for rectifying the speech problems among children that help to overcome the difficulties faced by the child in the speech related problems in his or her development."

Emotions are the prime motive forces of thought, feeling and conduct in which their continuous control is required. Emotion is associated with mood, temperament, personality, motivation and it requires continuous control. It is essential to know how emotions develop and how they affect personal and social adjustment in life. Emotions play a significant role in guiding and directing our behaviour, personality and overall approach to life.\nEmotions play a major role in the development of the child. There should be effort made in regard to the emotional development of the child as this shapes his or her personality. Emotions prepare an individual to face the world and acquire a heightened sense of emotional maturity gradually from childhood to adulthood. Emotional development is a process wherein there is great role of family, teachers, peers and society and large.\nIn this unit, the meaning of emotion, its types and characteristics have been explained. The concept of emotional development, the factors which influence emotional development and its stages have been analysed. The unit will also discuss the concept of emotional differentiation."

The examples of positive emotions are interest, enthusiasm, boredom, laughter, empathy, action and curiosity.\nNegative emotions include unpleasant emotions such as jealousy, anger, and fear which are harmful to an individual's development. In negative emotions, an attempt or intention to exclude positivity is expressed and arise by an underlying fear of the unknown, a fear of the actions of others, and a need tocontrol them or stop them to avoid being harassed.

Emotions are associated with instincts or biological drives as they are expressed when the basic need is satisfied or challenged.\n3.

Emotions are expressed in relation to concrete objects or situations and they start on the situations experienced or viewing any concrete objects.\n5.  Emotions are present at all stages of development and can be aroused in young as well as in old. They develop with every stage and can arise on various situations.\n6.  Emotions are extremely individualistic and differ from person to person and they arise in an individual internally according to own perceptions and instincts, and so differ from one to another.\n7.  Emotions rise abruptly in different situations spontaneously but slowly die down.\n8.  Emotions differ  from  person  to  person  and  are  separate  for  every individual and each individual imbibes different emotions at different times.\n9.

There are changes in the mannerisms in which a child expresses his or her emotions.\nThe ability to respond emotionally is present in the newborn infant and the first sign of emotional behaviour is general excitement activity due to strong stimulation which is reflected in the newborn's mass activity.\nThere are several factors that influence emotional development of children:\n1. Family  Environment: Family  does  influence  the  emotional development of the child. The environment that the family provides to the child determines his or her emotional set up. If the children have a positive experience in the family, they will develop positivity and stability in their behaviour and express their feelings in a balanced manner.\n2. School Environment: The experiences that children receive in schools influence their emotions and their process of emotional development.

It  is  the  ability  of  the  child  to recognize,  express,  and  manage  feelings  at  different  stages  of  life  and to  develop  empathy  for  others.  The  development  of  these  emotions, which include both positive and negative emotions, is largely affected by relationships that the child has with family-parents, siblings, and peers.\nThere are various stages of emotional development from infancy to adulthood . Infants between the ages of six and ten weeks begin to show emotion with a smile accompanied by actions and sounds that represent pleasure and joy in the child. Around three to four months infants begin to laugh, which demonstrates that they can recognize strangeness in actions that deviate from the norm of emotionally developing. From six to twelve months infants can begin to express emotions, such as fear, disgust, anger, and sadness. This stage indicates that the infants are able to show to their guardians that they are experiencing discomfort or displeasure and need more attention. During a child's second year, the infants begin to express different emotions such as shame, embarrassment, and pride, which are learned emotions based on their culture.  As they acquire language and learn to verbalize their feelings, they can express their emotions of affection, distress, pain, and fatigue. The ability to recognize, identify and define their emotions of the child at this stage tries to control emotional expression in ways that are consistent with cultural expectations of his or her immediate surroundings. Children learn to self-regulate their emotions to be able to cope with difficult situations. Usually by age two, children also begin to acquire the complex emotional sense and response of empathy with others by understanding others' emotional situations and understanding their side of perspectives.\nBy the age of three, children begin to understand society's cultural rules regarding expression of emotions such as anger and aggression and the way these emotions are to be controlled in the presence of adults. This difference is the result of differing consequences of their behaviour with adults or with peers.\nChildren acquire the ability to show and alter their emotional expressions by around age four . At this stage, they can display external expressions that do not necessary match their internal feelings and are sometimes different. This ability requires complex skills of understanding the need to alter their expression without showing the true emotions undergoing his or her mindset, realizing the perception of another, knowing that their expression does not need to match their actual feelings, and having the motivation and control to mask their true feelings convincingly and without any discomfort. As children develop, the things that develop their emotional responses change gradually; as do the strategies they use to manage them in different situations.\nYoung children's emotions are mainly made up of physical reactions (for  example,  heart  racing  behaviours). As  they  grow,  children  develop the  ability  to  recognise  feelings  and  their  emotions  are  also  increasingly influenced by their thinking and imagination. Moreover, they become more aware of their own feelings and are able to recognize and understand other people's emotions and situations in a better way. The experience of emotion includes several components:\n- Physical responses (for example, heart rate, breathing, hormone levels)\n- Feelings that children recognise and learn to name\n- Thoughts and judgements associated with feelings\n- Action signals\nChildren according to their families and culture, learn different ways of expressing emotion as there are different sets of beliefs with different family customs and set of rules followed. Some families and cultures encourage children  to  express  a  range  of  emotions  while  other  families  encourage children  not  to  display  certain  emotions,  such  as  anger  or  pride. These differences also influence the child's thinking pattern and the ways children learn to regulate their emotions.\nThere are various influences which inculcate children to express  emotions that  can  be  both  through  words  and  behaviour  pattern.  These  influences include:\n- Values about appropriate and inappropriate ways of expressing emotions and the belief pattern that children learn from parents, guardians and school.\n- Efficient way of handling and meeting children's emotional needs.\nNOTES"

This enables them to express their own emotions competently in their social environment. Child's developing skills in emotional understanding, includes recognition and appraisal along with the development of competent emotional expression which permits them to navigate the complex social and academic school environment successfully and to develop prosocial behaviours.\nOften the classroom can be a confusing and disorientating place for children who are unable to accurately identify emotions or interpret the impact of specific contexts on other people's emotions (Raver, Garner, & Smith-Donald, 2007) and this may result in children displaying externalizing behaviours that disrupt classroom learning."

    "context_enriched_content": "Emotional Development at Infancy\nAccording to psychologist, Hurlock, 'At birth and shortly afterwards the first sign of emotional behaviour is general excitement to strong stimulation. There are no indications of clearcut, definite emotional patterns that can be recognized and identified as specific emotional states' (1959,p.126). This stage is undifferentiated excitement to any stimulus. This stage gets over in a very short time and is quickly followed by general excitement which gets differentiated into simple responses that suggest pleasure and displeasure. The stimuli that bring pleasant responses such as patting, warmth etc. provide pleasant responses and those that bring unpleasant responses are like sudden loud noise, contact with cold or hot objects.\nAt the infant stage, the individual displays gratification of needs by eye contact, touch, movement, affection. The infant feels sense of self where individual feels either positive that he or she is cared for and loved or negative that he or she is unlovable and worthless. The behaviour expressed exhibits self-fulfilling prophecy. Infants begin to recognize the emotions of others and use them in reacting to novel situations.\nEarly Infancy: At the time between six to ten weeks, infant develops a social smile accompanied by other pleasure-indicative of the actions and sounds, which comes in response to adult smiles and interactions. Over a period of\ntime, infant becomes aware of their environment, smile occurs in response to wider variety of contexts. Around 3-4 months of infancy, laughter begins.\nLater Infancy: Infant during this period begins to express disgust, fear and anger. Anger is expressed by crying which is a frequent emotion expressed by infant. Fear emerges during this stage as children compare an unfamiliar event with what they know. Anxiety is expressed in infants from seven to 12 months. 'During the first two months, pleasure and displeasure come in response to 'physical' stimulation. By the third month, pleasure is aroused by 'psychological' stimulation as shown in the baby's smile in response to human face. Slightly later, displeasure can be aroused by psychological as well as physical stimuli as may be seen in the baby's reaction to being left alone' (Hulock, E.BB.1959,p.127).\nBefore 6 months, the pleasant and unpleasant responses generate emotional behaviour and when the infant completes 6 months, the negative emotions lead and gradually emotions such as fear, disgust, jealousy, anger are distinguishable. At the age of 10 and 12 months, the positive emotions such as affection, sympathy, enjoyment enter the infant's emotional behaviour. According to study conducted by psychologist, Bridges in 1931, up to 2 years almost all the positive as well as negative emotions gets distinguishable."

According to him, during early adulthood individuals enter Intimacy versus Isolation Stage. Moreover, they display more mature behaviour and have the capability of managing their emotions. At adulthood, the individuals display good conflict resolution skills and have a sense of personal responsibility for the outcomes of decisions taken and their outcomes.

At around three months, the general excitement becomesdifferentiated between distress and delight. This shows a state of distress. The child gets delighted and makes pleasant sound by cooing and gurgling when she or he is being rocked, patted and played with. By about two years, the child starts displaying other emotions like fear, disgust, anger, jealously, joy, elation, affection for adults and children. By the age of five, one would be able to distinguish the expressions of shame, anxiety, tear, disgust, disappointment, anger, envy, jealousy, joy, elation and so on. As they grow older, these emotional responsesbecome less diffuse, random and undifferentiated.\nBridges described infant emotions as originating in a state of diffuse excitement that first differentiates to generate delight and distress and then more distinct emotion states such as fear, anger, elation, and affection. There arevariations in frequency, intensity and duration of the different emotions and in the age at which they appear. Variations may be due in part to children's physicalstate, intellectual state and environmental conditions. The difference may be due to the influence of maturation and learning on emotionaldevelopment. Individual differences are inevitable because of maturation and learning. Regardless of individual differences, however, certain characteristic features of children's emotions make them different from those of adults."

(National Scientific Council on the Developing Child 2004, 2)\nThus, social emotional development refers to the capability of the child from birth through childhood to form close and secure adult and peer relationships and express emotions in socially and culturally appropriate ways in the context of family, community, and culture. It is indeed very important to develop the socio-emotional aspects of the child as this determines his or her overall personality for lifelong.\nSocial  and  emotional  development is complex and includes many different  areas  of  growth-  temperament:  the  way  a  young  child  acts  and responds to different situations, caregivers, and stranger, attachment: the emotional  bond  between  a  child  and  caregiver,  social  skills  or  social competence:  the  ability  to  get  along  with  other  people  and  emotion regulation: the ability of a child to control his or her emotions and reactions to the environment.\nSocio-Emotional Development\nNOTES\nSocio-Emotional Development"

Social relationships  are  build  with  the  experiences  they  share  with  self,  family members, peers, teachers, neighbours and siblings. The interaction with self and getting aware about one's identity, strengths and weaknesses is an important aspect of the emotional development in an individual.\nSocial-emotional development is a child's ability to understand the feelings of others, control their own feelings and behaviours, and get along with peers. A child's socio-emotional development determines his or her ability to understand oneself and his or her immediate surroundings. It is what drives an individual to communicate, connect with others, and more importantly, helps resolve conflicts, gain confidence and reach goals.\nA child's positive relationship with trusting and caring adults is the key to successful social and emotional development. Social and emotional development involves the acquisition of a set of skills. A child's socialemotional development provides them with a sense of who they are in the world; how they learn, and helps them establish quality relationships with others. It is what drives an individual to communicate, connect with others, and more importantly, helps resolve conflicts, gain confidence and reach goals. Building a strong social-emotional foundation as a child will help the child thrive and obtain happiness in life. Moreover, they will be better equipped to handle stress and persevere through difficult times in their lives as an adult. Those children who are gradually given specific training in social-emotional skills are taught how to solve their own problems independently, to negotiate, and to make compromises. These skills must be taught in a proactive, focused way, not in the heat of the moment after a problem occurred. Children need to  practice  using  these  skills  when  they  are  calm. Then  when  a  problem does occur, the adult can support children in putting their skills into action. (Schwartz 2007). Positive social and emotional development is important. This development influences a child's self-confidence, empathy, the ability to develop meaningful and lasting friendships and partnerships, and a sense of importance and value to those around him or her. Children's social and emotional development also influences all other areas of development. Social and emotional development means how children start to understand who they are, what they are feeling and what to expect when interacting with others. It is the development of being able to:\n- Form and sustain positive relationships.\n- Experience, manage and express emotions.\n- Explore and engage with the environment.\nObservation plays a vital role in how young children learn new things. If the child sees you sharing, expressing gratitude, being helpful, and sharing feelings, your child will have a good solid understanding of how to interact with other people outside the home. Parents can also boost empathy and build emotional intelligence by encouraging their children to think about how other people feel. Early social and emotional development establishes a psychological foundation for emerging competence across developmental domains and is based on children's relationships with those who care for\nNOTES"

Social and emotional health is vulnerable to adversity, which affects many young children's social and emotional health is just as important as their physical health, and affects their capacity to develop and potential to lead a fulfilling life. Children enter primary school; they are faced with increased demands for well-regulated and goal-directed activities such as complying with school rules and following group instructions. This requires the child to apply self-regulation skills, and inhibit behaviours that might impact their ability to participate in class. Children are also required to make friends by initiating and sustaining positive relationships or even display interpersonal problem solving skills when conflict arises. Parents can gain an understanding of their child's social-emotional strengths and weakness by observing their child's development at home or by working collaboratively with their child's preschool teacher.\nThe home environment provides the first step into emotional and social development as children learn to manage strong emotions such as anger or fear, and navigate around interpersonal relationships such as siblings or other extended family members.\nThe preschool environment provides a supportive setting where children  have  opportunities  to  practice  emotional  regulation  and  social skills with their peers. Social or emotional competence of young children is an important predictor of success in school. There is solid evidence that children need to achieve minimal social or emotional competence by about the age of 6 (Katz and McClellan, 1997) to have a positive experience in the early elementary grades. The basic competencies of social or emotional development help not only in the preschool and kindergarten years but also in the long-term-affecting lifelong trajectories related to schooling and employment. Healthy social-emotional development for infants and toddlers unfolds in an interpersonal context, namely that of positive ongoing relationships with familiar, nurturing adults.\nSocial or emotional development includes the following aspects:\n- Identify and understand one's feelings\n- Accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others\n- Manage strong emotions and their expression in a constructive manner\n- Regulate one's behaviour\n- Develop empathy for others\n- Establish and sustain relationships"

A child is believed to have a strong foundation of his or her personality for later development if he or she can identify, manage personal feelings, understand others' feelings and needs, and interact positively with others. Differences in social and emotional development result from a child's  inborn  temperament, cultural influences, disabilities, behaviours modeled by adults, the level of security felt in a child's relationships with adults, and the opportunities provided for social interaction. Positive social and emotional development in the early years provides a critical foundation for lifelong development and learning. Social development refers to a child's ability to create and sustain meaningful relationships with adults and other children. Emotional development is a child's ability to express, recognize, and manage his or her emotions, as well as respond appropriately to others' emotions. Both social and emotional development is important for young children's mental health.  Social development begins in infancy, when infants respond to the familiar voice, smell and touch of the important people in their lives. When these first social experiences are rewarding, they support the next stage in social development. Toddlers learn to share, cooperate, take turns, compromise and negotiate through relationships which they observe. A preschooler who looks up expectantly toward a parent when encountering an unexpected event depends on the adult's emotions for guidance about how to respond. An adult's emotional response to a situation greatly influences the young child's feelings about the situation. With adult support, preschool-age children learn more complex relationship skills including how to express personal views and opinions, how to discuss and resolve conflicts, and how to enjoy relationships. Infant emotions are evoked by physical conditions: hunger, discomfort, temperature or fatigue. An infant's emotional repertoire is  basic,  ranging  from  cooing  to  crying,  and  is  shaped  by  temperament. Preschoolers' emotions are more tied to their psychological condition i.e. how they interpret their experiences, what they think others are doing or thinking, and expectations about future events. Preschoolers are capable of anticipating\nNOTES"

Community: Child in a particular community exhibits a specific code of social behaviour and tries to develop his or her emotions as witnessed by him or her. Every community has a specific set of characteristics, cultural pattern, traditions and social codes; these have an impact on the way child socially develops with specific perceptions and school of thought and also develop emotions parallel to the ones witnessed by him or her."

Adolescence stage is often marked with increased friendly relationships. Emotional behaviour of the adolescence dominates his or her social characteristics and qualities. There is too much diversity in the adolescents regarding their social interests. Adolescents must be trained to control their emotions and achieve a mental balance and stability which will lead to individual happiness and social efficiency. The social relationships that an adolescent makes are often too attached and have a great influence on them. The emotions are very high at this stage as it is very difficult for an adolescent to exercise control over his or her emotions. Therefore, there is wide fluctuation of emotions among adolescents. 'There is a tide which begins to rise in the veins of youth at the age of eleven or twelve. It is called by the name of adolescence. If that tide can be taken at the flood, and a new voyage begun in the strength and along the flow of its current, we think that it will move on to fortune' (Ross J.S.,1951p.153).\nMoreover there are specific areas of interests that adolescents cater to, under the influence of peers. The culture, socio-economic background of peers, all has impact on the adolescents. They tend to choose their friends of the same level or of higher socio-economic status, common interests, social pressure and mutual interdependence on each other. Therefore, at adolescence stage, there is a wide variety of social relationships that an individual can make and there are also wide fluctuations in their emotional behaviour that determine their behaviour."

Families or Parents that experienced positive life experiences are better equipped to be emotionally stable, available and responsive to a young child than are the parents who have not or experienced some negative responses. When parents and young children are emotionally tuned in to each other, caregivers can more easily read the child's emotional cues and respond appropriately to his or her needs. This responsive relationship between the young child and parents supports healthy development in communication, cognition, social-emotional competence, and moral understanding through school and teachers, socio-emotional development of children is impacted and has a great influence on their behaviour. Children can learn to cope with their feelings and emotions much more effectively through social games and play. When preschoolers, kids, and teens play social-emotional activities and social development games they are less likely to explode into tantrums and fits of rage. They will still get frustrated and angry, but the intensity and duration will decrease over time as they learn effective self-regulation skills and coping strategies to manage their anger. Social or Emotional Development in  an  individual  includes  self-management  skills,  social  awareness  and interpersonal skills, and decision-making skills and responsible behaviours. The following suggestions should be kept in regard by teachers in developing social and emotional development of children:\n- Teachers should make students aware of their own strengths and weaknesses.\n- Teachers should create opportunities for children to get social exposure.\n- Teachers should take care of the individual differences of students in classroom in regard to their social behaviour.\n- Teachers should give equal opportunities to students so that all students should be able to develop their self-confidence.\n- Children should be given proper counseling at social occasions and guidance at every time.\n- Children should be provided with morals and spiritual sessions.\n- Schools should have provisions for recreation activities such as yoga and meditation.\n- Teachers should encourage students to participate in various diverse activities so that they develop social contacts.\n- Teachers should try to make students calm their extreme behaviour.\n- Teachers should not have biased behaviour that affects the emotional development of the children.\n- Teachers should understand the reasons of emotional disturbances of children and provide them with solutions.\n- Schools should facilitate in developing the life skills of students.\n- Schools should provide adequate facilities for enhancing physical development of children.\n- Teachers should serve as a role model to the students whom the students should try to imitate their  cordial  social  and  emotional  composed behaviour.\n- Children should be made aware of the results of their social behaviour.\n- Be a role model.\n- Listen and validate your child's emotional experience.\n- Be aware of your nonverbal communication.\n- Set clear boundaries on inappropriate behaviours.\n- Provide opportunities for practice.\n- Focus on the positive.\n- Play helps children practice their communication skills as they negotiate roles and appreciate others' feelings. They learn to share, wait their turn, and handle conflicts while playing with others.\n- Teachers have a large role to play in the development of social or emotional competence. A positive foundation in these skills will serve children well throughout their lifespan, helping each child to accept and benefit from education and experience in every domain."

In  infancy,  the  emotions  are  expressed  through  crying,  yelling  and laughing and as the child gradually progresses towards childhood, the child tries to express his or her behaviour through the use of language and actions.\n6.  The main causes of development of unsocial tendencies are as follows:\n13. (a)  Bad physical health i.e. lacks of proper nutrition, diseases and incapacities affects children's social behaviour.\n14. (b)  Bad  environment i.e.  unfavourable  conditions  at  home,  nonhelpful attitude  of  parents,  Child's  inability  to  understand  the change in the environment and lack of proper nutrition."

Children can develop increasing independence when they are securely attached and this can help in exploring their environment with confidence that they can respond back to a carer who will respond to their needs. Therefore, securely attached children will develop good self-esteem and confidence.\nThere  are  major  four  types  of  attachment  that  are  found  in  the individuals. The type of attachment depends upon how the care giver had responded to the feelings of infant. Home environment plays a major role in  determining the type of attachment. Therefore, it is very important to understand the type of attachment that an individual possess as this determines the  overall  personality  of  the  child. Attachment  also  influences  students' school success. This is true in case of students' attachment to their parents, as well as to their teachers. Secure attachment is associated with higher grades and standardized test scores compared to insecure attachment because of the confidence that a secure attached child has is not reflected in an insecure attached child.\nIn  this  unit,  the  development  of  attachment,  its  characteristics  and importance have been explained. The psychological theory of attachment and the main types of attachment have been highlighted. The unit will also discuss the meaning of trust-temper tantrums and the importance of trust in children."

Attachment is where the child uses the primary caregiver as a secure base. The emotional bond that typically forms between infant and caregiver is the means by which the helpless infant gets primary needs met. It then becomes the engine of subsequent social, emotional, and cognitivedevelopment. The early experience of the infant stimulates growth of neuralpathways that will sculpt enduring patterns of response to many people, life events, and things in  general. The  attachment  experience  affects  personality  development, particularly a sense of security, and research shows that it influences the ability to form stable relationships throughout life. The genius of the attachment system is that it provides the infant's first coping system; it sets up in the infant's mind a mental representation of the caregiver. It is so because, it allows an infant to separate from the caregiver without distress and begin to explore the world around her, attachment contains within it the platform for the child's ability to survive independently.\nPsychologist,  Bowlby  (1958)  proposed  that  attachment  can  be understood within an evolutionary context in that the caregiver provides safety and security for the infant. Attachment is adaptive as it enhances the infant's chance of survival. Parenting for a secure attachment has two themes\n1.  Providing comfort when needed\n2.  Offering the freedom to explore when desired\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES"

    "context_enriched_content": "NOTES\nIt is a simple concept, but one that can be complex to manifest in the rush of everyday life.\nPsychologist, Maccoby (1980 has described four main characteristics of an attachment. These are as follows:\n1.   Seeking proximity, the desire to be close to the person to whom you are attached.\n2.   Separation anxiety, the distress that results from being separated from that person.\n3.   Pleasure when reunited, relief and observable joy when reunited with them.\n4.   General orientation of behaviour towards the caregiver, the child's awareness of where the person is, and the reassurance they feel by them being close.\nAttachment is an emotional bond between a child and caregiver. The ability to form an attachment is present from birth and plays two important roles for young children. First, it motivates children to stay near a caregiver, which keeps them safe. Second, it allows children to depend on their caregiver as a source of support as they explore their surroundings. Children who do this successfully have what is often called 'secure attachment'. Attachment is the word used to refer to the relationship developed between an infant and a parent or primary caregiver during the first two to three years of life. How this relationship forms is dependent on how a parent responds to a child's needs for care, comfort and security.\nThe development of a secure attachment is important for many reasons. Some of the reasons are enlisted as follows:\n- Promotes a positive relationship between a child and caregiver\n- Decreases risk for social and emotional problems later in childhood and adulthood\n- Encourages healthy relationships outside the home (for example, child-care providers, friends, other adults)\n- Fosters  positive,  trusting  relationships  in  middle  childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.\nA child will be able to form one to two strong and positive attachment relationships with parents, and then have a supportive web of secondary attachments with siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, close friends and caregivers. This is the most positive environment for a young child. Children who experienced a secure attachment at one year are better able to explore on their own than are insecure infants (Waters, Whippman, and Sroufe, 1979). Preschool children who are secure demonstrate better social skills and school adjustment than do their insecure peers (Sroufe, Carlson, and Schulman, 1993).\nElementary school children who are secure are significantly more accepted by their peers and have more friendships and are less lonely than are less secure children (Kerns, Klepac, and Cole, 1996). The attachment security a child feels throughout his or her early years has been associated with that youngster's later ability to pay attention, focus, and learn in school. Children with secure attachment histories earn higher grades and are more goal oriented and cooperative than are students with insecure attachment histories (Crittenden, 1992; Jacobsen and Hofmann, 1997)."

    "context_enriched_content": "NOTES\nSecure attachment is also created when the mother holds or cuddles her infant and toddler in ways that are comforting. The mother reflects the infant's behaviours and responds in ways the child enjoys. By attachment , we mean the relationship formed between the infant and the primary caregiver. A primary caregiver is the person, usually the mother, with whom the infant most frequently interacts. Through bonding with this caregiver, a child develops expectations about the extent to which he or she can acquire and maintain secure relationships, as well as beliefs about others' trustworthiness in relationships.  Attachment to a protective caregiver helps infants to regulate their negative emotions in times of stress and distress and to explore the environment, even if it contains somewhat frightening stimuli. Attachment, a major developmental milestone in the child's life, remains an important issue throughout the lifespan. Attachment, the affective bond of infant to parent, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of stress in times of distress, anxiety or illness. Human beings are born with the innate bias to become attached to a protective caregiver. But infants develop different kinds of attachment relationships: some infants become securely attached to their parent, and others find themselves in an insecure attachment relationship. These individual differences are not genetically determined but are rooted in  interactions  with  the  social  environment  during  the  first  few  years  of life. Sensitive or insensitive parenting plays a key role in the emergence of secure or insecure attachments, as has been documented in twin studies and experimental intervention studies. Several key factors can affect the quality of a child's attachment. These can include the child's temperament (more active and outgoing) the context of the situation (stranger present, familiar room) early history (traumatic experience) and other things. However, the way in which a parent responds to and interacts with a young child is the key factor in how an attachment develops. Attachment is not a characteristic of  either  the  child  or  the  parent,  it  is  a  characteristic  of  the  relationship. The parent's sensitivity to the needs of the child is a major determinant in whether a secure or insecure attachment will develop. It has been found that the parent's ability to provide a secure attachment will be heavily influenced by the quality of care that they received during the first two or three years of their own life. Attachment bonds are extremely powerful and can yield great benefits or the inverse. Throughout one's life, attachment bonds are\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES\nextremely powerful, and like any powerful system the benefits can be very great  when the system is optimal, well balanced and working smoothly, but very painful if the system is sub-optimal, out of balance or broken. The nature of the attachment bond is passed on to the next generation. There is an inter-generational transmission of attachment styles. If the care that the parents received when they were children was sensitive and well balanced and provided them with a secure attachment, they are likely to provide similar parenting for their own children. Attachment behaviours must exist and be reciprocated for the infant to survive physically and psychically (Bowlby, 1958). Attachment is dynamic, complex, and ever evolving. It has both an internal,  psychic  organization  and  an  external,  observable  manifestation. Attachment is crucial to children's psychological welfare and forms the basis of personality development and socialization (Bowlby 1988). Children who can regulate their own emotions and responses are more popular, have fewer behavioural problems, are more emotionally stable, have fewer infectious illnesses and achieve more academically in schools (Gottman et al 2007)."

    "context_enriched_content": "14.2.1  Types of Attachment\nThe psychological  theory  of  attachment  was  developed  by  a  British psychologist, John Bowlby (and expanded upon by Mary Ainsworth-see next  section),  a  psychoanalyst  who  researched  the  effects  of  separation between infants and their parents (Fraley, 2010). The theory of attachment was first proposed by John Bowlby who described it as a 'lasting psychological connectedness between human beings' (1988). He considered that children needed to develop a secure attachment with their main caregiver in their early  years. This  theory  has  been  revised  to  acknowledge  that  multiple attachments can occur with other adults throughout the lifespan, although early experiences may continue to have an impact. Bowlby suspected that the  extreme  behaviours  infants  would  engage  in  to  avoid  separation  or when reconnecting with a physically separated parent, behaviours such as crying, screaming, and clinging, were actually evolutionary mechanismsbehaviours that were reinforced through natural selection and enhanced the child's chances of survival.\nThese attachment behaviours are instinctive responses to the perceived threat of losing the survival advantages that accompany being cared for and attended to by the primary caregiver(s). Since the infants who engaged in these behaviours were more likely to survive, the instincts were naturally selected and reinforced over generations.\nThese behaviours make up what Bowlby termed an 'attachment behavioural system', the system that guides us in our patterns and habits of forming and maintaining relationships (Fraley, 2010).\nIt  makes  intuitive  sense  that  a  child's  attachment  style  is  largely a  function  of  the  caregiving  the  child  receives  in  his  or  her  early  years; those who received support and love from their caregivers are likely to be secure, while those who experienced inconsistency or negligence from their caregivers are likely to feel more anxietysurrounding their relationship with their parents.\nHowever, attachment theory takes it one step further, applying what we know about attachment in children to relationships we engage in as adults. These relationships (particularly intimate and or romantic relationships) are also directly related to our attachment styles as children and the care we received from our primary caregivers (Firestone, 2013).\nThere are four types of infant-parent attachment: three 'organized' types  (secure,  avoidant  and  resistant)  and  one  'disorganized'  type. The quality of attachment that an infant develops with a specific caregiver is largely determined by the caregiver's response to the infant when the infant's attachment system is 'activated' (for example, when the infant's feelings of safety and security are threatened, such as when he or she is ill, physically hurt or emotionally upset; particularly, frightened).\nThere are four main types of attachment:\n1.   Secure Attachment\n2.  Avoidant Attachment\n3.   Ambivalent Attachment\n4.   Disorganized Attachment\nThese categories of relationship were developed by Mary Ainsworth, an American-Canadian developmental psychologist after John Bowlby.\nA child's  attachment  style  basically  gradually  develops  on  many factors, the major one is based on the child's perception or understanding of the caregiver's reliability in providing comfort, support and security and the past experiences that he or she had. In the following section, we will discuss the types of attachment in detail.\n1. Secure attachment Secure attachment is often seen in children where at home, the parents are most of the time emotionally available, perceptive, and responsive to infant's needs and mental states. The internal working model of these infants is likely to be one that expects that their needs will be known and met, that they will be attuned to and emotionally regulated, and that they can freely explore their environment in safety.\nA secure attachment in the child ensures that a person will feel both acknowledged, understood and always protected. Interestingly, it is not the perfect parenting or even lack of parental skills that determines attachment style.  Secure  attachments  develop  when parents can communicate (non-\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES\nDevelopment of Attachment"

Things that can stop secure attachment from developing include:\n- Being mistreated or abused\n- Only getting attention when acting out or behaving badly\n- Having your needs met infrequently or inconsistently\n- Being separated from parents\n- During childhood, children who are attached securely to their caregivers\n- Prefer being with their parents over others or strangers\n- Can separate from their parents without being overly upset\n- Look for comfort from their parents when they are afraid\n- Are happy to see their parents when they return\nAdults who were securely attached to their caregivers as children have a long-term relationship in which they can trust their partner and demonstrate good self-esteem. Not only are they comfortable sharing their feelings, hopes, and dreams with their partners, they are also able to seek support when needed. Secure individuals can support their partners as well and comfort them when they are hurting. A secure attachment helps the individual to build confidence and trust in the goodness of everyone that a person carries throughout his or her daily life. It is the sense of being loved and supported no matter what happens. And when children feel secure, a world of possibilities opens up. Raising a Secure Child is neither a quick read nor a how-to, but instead invites thoughtful reflection. Children who are secure demonstrate greater ability to handle stress and help others handle stress, while children who are insecure are more likely to struggle when stressed, act out in unhealthy ways and be insensitive to others who are stressed. Securely attached children have experienced sensitive and attuned caregiving. They are able to trust and rely on teachers to meet their needs. As a result they feel confident to form meaningful relationships with others, to make the most of learning opportunities, to engage in productive activities, problem-solve and explore the wider world.\n2. Avoidant attachment In avoidant attachment, infants did not use their mothers much as a secure base from which to explore. When the mother began to leave the room, the infant might move towards her, but often did not. When the mother returned, the infant acted like she or he was not even there and just continued playing. Characterized by children who avoid or ignore a parent's presence, show little response when parents are close by, display few strong emotional outbursts, and may avoid or ignore a parent's responses toward them.\nAt home, the family where the parents are seen to be emotionally unavailable for the child, and also many times imperceptive, unresponsive, and rejecting in almost all situations. Some families who are responsive in many non-emotional interactions, but are very dismissive and non-responsive when the child really emotionally needed the family, but there is no closeness or attachment showed to the children, they tend to be frustrated, or angry. These infants often express random aggression, anxiety and sadness. These children tend to be clingier and demanding in the home then securely attached infants.\nThe infants then protect themselves from this difficult situation by dissociating from contact with their normal need for connection, and repress their emotions more generally. This is a 'deactivating' strategy with respect to attachment.\nThis avoidance of intimate relationships is based on childhood events, usually, a situation in which a caregiver was unable or unwilling to parent in a way that would build a secure attachment. In some situations, parents were there physically, but for one reason or another were not able to meet their child›s emotional needs. To get by, the child learns to pretend they do not have emotional needs at all.\nThis unhealthy style of attachment carries into adulthood and creates a grownup who dismisses the need for love and closeness. These signs are usually present if a person has an avoidant attachment type:\n- Uncomfortable with deep feelings and intimate situations\n- Set extreme boundaries either emotional or physical\n- May hide information from their partners\n- Send mixed signals while also disregarding their partner's feelings\n- Are non-committal\n- Idolize past relationships\nThough they may desire relationships and intimacy deep down, avoidant attachment types are usually unable to fulfill their desires because of their internal issues.  Avoidant attached children have experienced insensitive, intrusive  or  rejecting  caregiving. They  appear  to  be  independent  of  their teachers and seek to meet their needs on their own as they have not been able to trust or rely on their caregiver. They are task orientated, self-reliant and high achieving in some aspects but are generally socially uncomfortable, exhibit indifference and avoid close relationships\n3. Ambivalent attachment In ambivalent attachment, these infants were more alert of the whereabouts of mother while playing. They were very upset when she left the room, immediately went to her upon return and got very clingy. Their behaviour upon reunion alternated between outbursts of anger\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES\nDevelopment of Attachment"

These infants were the most anxious, clingy, and demanding at home.\nThese infants respond by 'over-activating' their attachment system. Like secure attachment types, people with this type of attachment crave love and intimacy. Unfortunately, they feel doubtful about their self-worth. Because of their internal feelings of insecurity, people with this form of anxious attachment type demand attention. Characterized by children who become anxious and seek parents but then struggle to get away, are reluctant to explore the environment, become upset easily and exhibit frustration with their parents' responses to them. Ambivalent attachment signifies that the children have experienced inconsistent and largely unresponsive caregiving at their homes wherein the family has not developed any attachment. They are easily frustrated and may present as both clingy and rejecting of a teacher as they seek both comfort from but are unable to be comforted by adults. They may present as immature, fussy, helpless, passive or whiney or they may be angry\n4. Disorganized attachment Disorganized attachment was not an original classification in this type of attachment, but later studies showed some infants who got disorganized when their mothers left the room, and also expressed disorganized patterns of behaviour on return (move towards mother, then away; freeze; go into a corner). They were not soothed if they made contact with the mother. The final type of insecure attachment is one not based solely on neglect or preoccupation but on intense fear. Parents of children with a disorganized attachment type are usually dealing with trauma themselves. Because of unresolved trauma, pain, or loss, the parent is unable to attach themselves securely to their child.\nIt is approximated that about eighty percent of abused children have this type of disorganized attachment. Because their primary caregiver's behaviour was often erratic and driven by fear and suppression, adults with this type of attachment never learned to self-soothe themselves because their past is full of pain and loss. They may become aggressive, see the world as unsafe, and have trouble socially. Characterized by children who are not predictable in their behaviour, seem unable to cope easily or be comforted when stressed, and show evidence of fear or confusion around a caregiver.\nSigns of disorganized attachment style include:\n- A cold attitude when it comes to relationships.\n- Antisocial behaviour or lack of remorse.\n- Tend to be selfish, controlling, and lack personal responsibility.\n- Recreate abusive patterns from their childhood in adult relationships.\n- Are at a higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse as well as criminal behaviour.\nDisorganized attached children are usually from neglected, abusive homes where the child is not presented any situations where he or she feels organized and secured. The child exhibits feelings such as confusion in many situations and with people like teachers and think and experience them as frightening or frightened. These children are often, easily distracted, have a strong sense of fear, panic, or helplessness, highly vigilant and may present extreme, unpredictable or distressing behaviour, which adults may find shocking and difficult to manage. Their inner working model of the relationship with others is not functional, and is one where the expected source of soothing is also the source of danger, leaving the mind and state and behaviour of the child very disorganized in almost every situation."

In children particularly infants, this emotional outbreak can lead to crying, screaming, kicking, biting, hitting, throwing things on others and banging the head. Infant tantrums are actually natural behaviours that can be found in them. They usually result from unmet needs, requirements or desires that they need and expect to be approved. Tantrums are more likely to appear in young children because that's when they start to learn that they are separate from their parents and want to seek independence. The child may also struggle with internalizing problems or have externalizing issues with them. Emotion's regulation can also affect future social competence as well as academic performance. During the first two years of your baby's life, 'attachment' is the word used to describe the relationship you have with him. When the child can and has confidence on you and trust you to meet his or her basic needs for food, love, affection and stimulation, the attachment become stronger and he or she learns to trust you and the world around him or her.\nNOTES\nDevelopment of Attachment\nNOTES\nIf a child learns early on that expressing his or her feeling and that results  in  parental  anger  or  punishment,  he  or  she  may  resort  to  being compliant or being defiant. Either way, it means the child will not have the opportunity to form proper brain connections to deal with strong emotions. When facing frustrations later in life, he or she may struggle to be assertive or have angry outbursts.\nThe lack of vocabulary to express themselves also adds to their anger and frustration in children because they are not able to communicate their feelings and this leads to anger and frustration. Temper tantrums then become their outlets and their words. When children are having emotional tantrums, they are telling us that they are in deep emotional pain and they cannot cope on their own. Temper tantrums are not always about trying to control or manipulate parents. For young toddlers, they are not capable of reasoning or manipulating and so they tend to have mostly emotional tantrums when they are upset.\nFor older ones, it could be a mixed bag of emotions. Older toddlers are still not experts in the emotional regulation, so they can have emotional tantrums, too. Depending on past behaviour and parents' reactions, some children learn to use tantrums as a means to get what they want.\nTrust is a lifelong issue for all of us and in children, it starts from infancy itself. The need to repair or have closure to a trust issue is important to face.  A healthy attachment is one way to get children through hard times in their lives with less damage to their brain development and therefore to their social-emotional and cognitive development. As the child progresses in age, there are increasing opportunities for uncertainty to develop, but these same situations also offer opportunities for trust to grow in child. As the lives of children become increasingly intertwined with the members of society and family, the possibilities for conflict are intensified. These points of conflict carry with them risks of rejection and harm but, at the same time, they offer opportunities for each partner to demonstrate concern for the relationship and a willingness to take the other's needs into account. If conflict issues are successfully resolved, not only is trust strengthened, but the child also develops greater confidence so that future problems can be solved together. Trust develops as children demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice their own interests in order to take the needs and concerns of others into account. With each successful experience of disclosure or conflict resolution there is further evidence of the partner's commitment to the relationship with others and greater confidence and trust that the relationship will last and grow stronger. Therefore, children's attachment is an important aspect in the growth of their personality during their lifespan."

The ability  to  form  an  attachment  is  present  from  birth  and  plays  two important roles for young children.\n- Attachment to a protective caregiver helps infants to regulate their negative emotions in times of stress and distress and to explore the environment, even if it contains somewhat frightening stimuli.\n- Attachment, the affective bond of infant to parent, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of stress in times of distress, anxiety or illness.\n- Sensitive or insensitive parenting plays a key role in the emergence of secure or insecure attachments, as has been documented in twin studies and experimental intervention studies. Several key factors can affect the quality of a child's attachment.\n- Attachment is not a characteristic of either the child or the parent, it is a characteristic of the relationship.\n- The psychological theory of attachment was developed by a British psychologist, John Bowlby (and expanded upon by Mary Ainsworthsee  next  section),  a  psychoanalyst  who  researched  the  effects  of separation between infants and their parents (Fraley, 2010).\n- The attachment behaviours are instinctive responses to the perceived threat of losing the survival advantages that accompany being cared for and attended to by the primary caregiver(s).\n- There are four types of infant-parent attachment: three 'organized' types (secure, avoidant and resistant) and one 'disorganized' type.\n- A child's attachment style basically gradually develops on many factors, the major one is based on the child's perception or understanding of the caregiver's reliability in providing comfort, support and security and the past experiences that he or she had.\n- Secure attachment is often seen in children where at home, the parents are most of the time emotionally available, perceptive, and responsive to infant's needs and mental states.\n- In avoidant attachment, infants did not use their mothers much as a secure base from which to explore.\n- In  ambivalent  attachment,  these  infants  were  more  alert  of  the whereabouts of mother while playing. They were very upset when she left the room, immediately went to her upon return and got very clingy.\n- Disorganized attached children are usually from neglected, abusive homes where the child is not presented any situations where he or she feels organized and secured.\n- Temper tantrum in children is an intense storm of emotions, which are usually shown through anger, loss, disappointment and deep frustration, in the child.\n- Infant tantrums are actually natural behaviours that can be found in them. They usually result from unmet needs, requirements or desires that they need and expect to be approved.\n- When children are having emotional tantrums, they are telling us that they are in deep emotional pain and they cannot cope on their own.\n- Trust is a lifelong issue for all of us and in children, it starts from infancy itself. The need to repair or have closure to a trust issue is important to face.\n- Trust develops as children demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice their own interests in order to take the needs and concerns of others into account."

There are numerous emotional expressions that children experience. Role of parents and the school authorities is to encourage them for positive emotions and negate those emotions that harm the development of the child. There are various developmental issues that children cater to from infancy to adulthood.\nThe collection of emotions determines the psycho-social development of the child. When there are unpleasant emotions that become dominant, they tend to mould the children's outlooks on life unfavourably. This results in less personal and social adjustment and leads the child to tackle in difficult situations.\nIn this unit, the meaning of emotions, the forms of emotional expressions and its importance have been explained. The unit will also discuss the major forms of emotional expressions in children and the ways to handle emotional expressions."

    "context_enriched_content": "15.2  EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS OF CHILDREN\nEmotion has been defined as a 'sudden trouble, transient agitation caused by an acute experience of fear, surprise, joy, etc' (Larousse Dictionary, 1990).\nEmotional responses are most readily differentiated in terms of whether they are generally pleasant (positive or integrative; on the one hand, or generally unpleasant).\nSpecific emotions are sometimes differentiated on the basis of the level of arousal or excitement involved (Tomkins 1962)( for example, interest versus delight); sometimes on the basis of the nature of the individual's behavioural response to the eliciting stimulus (Hebb1946b) (for example, rage,  expressed by attack--versus fear, expressed inavoidance or flight); sometimes on the basis of the individual's perception of the circumstances of the situation and his relationship to it (Schachter1964) (for example, jealousy, as a reaction to threatened or actual displacement in a valued relationship with someone else versus humiliation or shame, as a reaction to failure to meet standards or expectations which are highly valued by oneself and by others whose approval and disapproval are important.\nChildren have different forms of emotional expressions at different situations.  According to Bridges, 'a three-month-old infant may show delight and distress, the six month old the emotions of fear, disgust and anger, and a year-old child may show affection and elation. At the age of a year and half, he shows the emotion of jealousy. At the age of two years he is more able than before to show greater elation, anger, disgust and fear'. All emotions play important roles in children's lives through the influence they have on children's personal and social adjustments. Childhood emotions differ from adult's emotions in intensity, in frequency, in permanency, in strength.\nEmotional control is the ability to assess emotion-provoking stimuli before responding to them and of learning to express the emotions in socially approved patterns of behaviour. Emotion is indeed a heterogeneous category that  encompasses a wide variety of important psychological phenomena. Some emotions are very specific, insofar as they concern a particular person, object, or situation. Others, such as distress, joy, or depression, are very general. The proper development and functioning of emotions allow people to live well and to be happy. Love, respect, and compassion, for example, are the essential emotional ingredients of interpersonal relations and concerns. Emotions motivate moral (as well as immoral) behaviour; play an essential  role  in  creativity  and  in  scientific  curiosity.  Different  emotions will  manifest  such  structures  to  different  extents  and  in  different  ways,\ndepending on the specific emotion, its type, and the circumstances. After a traumatic event, it is typical for children (and adults) to experience a wide range of emotions, including fearfulness, shock, anger, grief and anxiety. Your children›s behaviours may change because of their response to the event. They may experience trouble sleeping, difficulty with concentrating on school work or changes in appetite. This is normal for everyone and should begin to disappear in a few months. Encourage your children to put their feelings into words by talking about them or journaling. The behavioural expression of emotion also includes conscious and unconscious gestures, postures and mannerisms, and overt behaviour that can be either spontaneous or deliberate. Emotion is not something that is distinct from and somehow overlays an experience; the experience is part of the structure of the emotion itself. The social structures of emotion consist of the ways in which the larger social context determines an emotion's causes, content, modes of expression, and meaning. Emotions are subject to social shaping in their modes of expression in the sense that most expressions, perhaps even those that are more or less hardwired, are subject to local 'display rules', which govern which emotions and which expressions are appropriate in which circumstances. Emotions can be rational in the sense that they can be used to achieve certain basic human goals and aspirations. Getting angry may be an important step in motivating oneself to face obstacles and overcome them. Emotions are the product not only of culture but also of one's behaviour and attitudes over time, one is to a certain extent responsible for them. Emotions can be consciously developed or discouraged by training oneself to react more or less emotionally-or with more of one kind of emotion and less of another-in certain circumstances."

A three or four year child has very little sense of honour or humiliation, so he may show in any forms his or her anger.

Some children try to control their anger and do not exhibit violent behaviour; on the other hand, some children exhibit violent behaviour and are not able to control their anger in all situations. Children have different reasons for being angry such as interference, blocking of activities, disturbances in their plans and wishes. Impulsive responses are usually called as aggression. These are more common than inhibited expressions which are kept 'bottled'. In such cases children tend to withdraw into themselves and do not speak up.\nIn case of child showing anger, the parents should deal with him or her sympathetically and with affection. Anger can be a particularly powerful emotion characterized by feelings of hostility, agitation, frustration, and antagonism towards others. Like fear, anger can play a part in your body's fight or flight response. When a threat generates feelings of anger, you may be inclined to fend off the danger and protect yourself. Anger is often displayed in the following ways:\n- Facial expressions such as frowning or glaring\n- Body language such as taking a strong stance or turning away from someone\n- Tone of voice such as speaking gruffly or yelling\n- Physiological responses such as sweating or turning red\n- Aggressive behaviours such as hitting, kicking, or throwing objects"

Children are seen to be affectionate to their parents, home and relations in matter of affection. Feeling of affections should be widened so that children develop a sense of liberal outlook towards others. Affection helps the child to experience a feeling of trust and oneness in him or her. Affection leads the child to understand that social relations are for building unity and a sense of security develops in them. Affection is an emotional reaction towards a  person,  or  a  thing.  It  indicates  warm  regard,  friendliness,  sympathy  or helpfulness. Affection must be reciprocal; there must be an emotional linkage\nbetween children and significant people in their lives. Affection is shown in an outgoing, striving, approaching kind of behaviour. Infants respond to affection in forms of cuddling by reaching for the child's loved ones. Children may exhibit their affection in verbal expressions. Deprivation of affection may be a result of children's rejection of their parents, friends and teachers.\nIt is interesting to note that some observations of infants have suggested that early in the second year, when the infant begins to show affectionate behaviour(such as approaching, hugging, kissing and smiling), this behaviour appears to be directed first toward parents or adult caretakers, and shortly thereafter towards other young children (Bridges 1932)."

    "context_enriched_content": "Jealousy or Rivalry\nChildren compete with one another after the parents/guardians give affection to other children. The feeling of jealousy starts in infants at the age of year and half. Competitive spirit may be found in children because of the diverted attention of guardians to other children and zeal to win. Jealousy is present from the early years. It is more pronounced in the cases of love between the children of the opposite sexes, especially when a child monopolizes the attention of the adult while another fails to do so. Jealousy obstructs the natural speed of development. Infants show their jealousy through weeping. Distress and anger are included in jealousy. This emotion leads the child to give birth to solitude, rivalry and anger. It is important for the parents that jealousy must not be inculcated in children. It is an over growth of anger, giving rise  to  resentment  towards  others.  Most  childhood  jealousies  are homegrown as they originate in situations that come in home environment. Secondly children may develop jealousies in schools with their peers. The behaviour varies depending on different situations. Mostly children show feeling insecurity and uncertainty and children's responses are mainly direct and aggressive.\nEssentially, jealousy can be viewed as an emotional response to what the child perceives as his or her being actually or potentially displaced by someone else in his or her relationship with a special person, such as a parent. Jealousy is an emotion that could discreetly come into your child's life. The feeling could arise from his or her siblings, friends or classmates. A simple thing like a new bicycle for his friend could trigger envy in kid."

At infancy and babyhood, the most common fears are of loud noises, dark rooms, being alone, pain and strange people and places.  Among elder children, the fears are of supernaturalism and on injury and pain. There are variations in the pattern of fear as children's fears reflect variations in their mental and physical development. Older children have fears related to their own self status or identity; they are mostly afraid of failing, being ridiculed or perform actions that are different. This is what is called as individual differences. To\novercome fear, children try to keep away from a frightening situation. These common fears take place when children are exposed to something in life that they do not understand or feel they cannot control. School children have hospital related fears because of their developmental stage. They are not able to separate reality from the imaginary and their ability to express and cope with their fears is limited. Some children seem to be fearful of almost any new experience. These children require some special parenting approaches because they require preparation and support for new experiences. Fear depends on the surrounding environment of the child and his or her condition. It depends on the psychological and physiological condition of the child to determine how the child will react at time of fear. Fear occurs suddenly and unexpectedly and so the child is not able to accustom to that situation at that particular time. Children respond differently to fear, infants or children around 2 years cry as they call for help. As children get older, they try to not to cry even though their faces express withdrawn behaviour from the feared object. Fear is a powerful emotion that can also play an important role in survival. When you face some sort of danger and experience fear. Fear is the emotional response to an immediate threat.\nSpitz (1950) has proposed that the infant›s fear of strangers is essentially triggered by the threat of 'object loss', i.e.,  the  presence  of  the  stranger suggests an imminent separation from mother, so that the basic response is fear of separation."

Children mostly shy when they are put to new situations such as recitation of poems, meeting guests at home or participate in any school activity. They become shy because of their uncertainty about how others will react to them or will be laughed at. Infants show their shyness in crying, or clinging to a familiar person for protection.

Worry becomes more intense and frequent when childhood progresses. As there is more intellectual development, child ceases from worrying because he or she tries to see how illogical some worries are. Common worries that are seen in children are of home, school, friends, relationships and academics. The way children react to worries depends on children's personality patterns.

Some children tend to discuss their worries with others or elders and so are better adjusted. Children who feel insecurity often verbalize their fears and win sympathy from others. Mostly children express their worries by their facial expressions too and tend to look worried. As with age, children tend to worry less and look into the rationality of the matters."

    "context_enriched_content": "Anxiety\nAnxiety is an uneasy mental state wherein children anticipate some ill or misfortune. It is reflected among children in the expressions of uneasiness, apprehensions, helplessness, loss of trust and low self-confidence. The mental state  of  children  is  uneasiness  and  frustrated  or  dejected  behaviour. This emotion develops from fear and worry. Anxiety is an imaginary fear that develops after fear. It is mostly found in school going children from fourth grade to adolescents. Adolescents mainly feel anxiety in most situations because of their growing physical and intellectual development and also owing to social adjustments. This lowers the self confidence of children. Children  may  express  their  anxiety  in  behaviours  such  as  depression, nervousness, restless sleeps, quick anger, irritability, unhappiness etc."

There may be many reasons for this emotion such as insult from parents, teachers and other adults or a great loss. Children's memories should be faded as to help them divert their attention to something pleasant. Children react differently to grief, such as overt behaviour or inhibited expressions. Overt expressions may involve crying and anguish and inhibited expressions may consist of a general state of apathy where there is loss of interest in things around them."

    "context_enriched_content": "Stealing\nThere are a variety of reasons why children steal. For example, a two year old child might take something from another child because, at that age, there is little or no understanding of the concept to sharing. In fact, at age two, groups of children are usually described as being involved in parallel play where there is no real interaction between children. In other words, two-year-olds have no understanding of 'rules' that guide play at a later age. By the time children reach the age of six or seven, they understand rules, regulations and, to some extent, consequences. They may take something from another child or shoplift from a store. Knowing right and wrong, they may try to hide the ill begotten 'goods'. The motivation for this activity can be as simple as testing the limits."

    "context_enriched_content": "Frustration\nMost children go through peaks of frustration between the ages of one and three. They are discovering that there is so much they want to do but cannot or may not. Young children often express their frustration in tantrums. At that point many of them learn the word frustrated, and parents and teachers help them to find compromises and alternatives and to develop at least some degree of patience.\nIn  the  preschool  years,  further  sources  of  frustration  emerge: comparisons with peers, new expectations, and observations of older children (especially siblings) and adults. A child may be prone to frustration if he or she has minor delays in some developmental area, if he or she has easily succeeded at many things and does not remember the process of learning them, or if he or she is developing a somewhat perfectionist personality style.\nNOTES"

It is genetic and often runs in families; if not a parent, then an aunt, uncle, or grandparent likely wet the bed. Although stress can indirectly affect a child's bedwetting, most experts believe it is not the reason a child starts wetting the bed. Although stress does not cause a child to start wetting the bed, behaviour the child engages in when under stress can make bedwetting worse, or make a child who was mostly dry experience wet nights. Sleep deprivation resulting from stress can also cause a child to wet the bed."

These are more common than inhibited expressions which are kept 'bottled'.\n- In case of child showing anger, the parents should deal with him or her sympathetically and with affection.\n- Weeping may be an effect of distress, anger, fear or jealousy as the emotional tension generated by these emotions is released by flow of tears.\n- The emotion of affection is seen in infants at the age of 6 or 7 months as he or she shows his or her joy and affection to those who take care of him or her.\n- Affection must be reciprocal; there must be an emotional linkage between children and significant people in their lives.\n- The feeling of jealousy starts in infants at the age of year and half. Competitive spirit may be found in children because of the diverted attention of guardians to other children and zeal to win. Jealousy is present from the early years.\n- Curiosity is  mostly  experienced  by  children  when  they  are  out  in different new situations. Children are interested in everything in their environments and they are curious about their own selves, about people i.e. their clothing, dresses and actions.\n- Aggression is defined as 'a forceful action or procedure (such as an unprovoked attack), especially when intended to dominate or master.'\n- Slyness is a form of express which mostly all children exhibit in their childhood. They tend to shy from the strangers.\n- Embarrassment is a type of fear reaction to others where the child experiences this emotion resulting in low self-confidence.\n- Worry is usually described as 'imaginary fear'. Children ace this emotion owing to the uncertainty of their actions in future.\n- Anxiety is an uneasy mental state wherein children anticipate some ill or misfortune. It is reflected among children in the expressions of uneasiness, apprehensions, helplessness, loss of trust and low selfconfidence.\n- Joy and delight is a pleasant emotion which every child experiences.
