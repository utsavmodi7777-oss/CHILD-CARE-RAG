This uses 'thinking words' instead of 'fighting words.' For example, instead of saying, 'No, you can't go out to play until you practice your lessons,' you could say, 'Yes, you may go out to play as soon as you practice your lessons.' The limit is the same, but the child's reaction is usually different and more cooperative.",paraphrase,high,1. CHDV-100-OER-Textbook-updatedJuly2020_4,25.
