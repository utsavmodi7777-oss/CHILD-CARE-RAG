    "query": "How does the arrival of a new baby affect my older child's behavior?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "The birth of a new sibling can be a developmental crisis for many children. It changes the home environment and parental attention, which can lead to jealousy, behavioral regressions, or tantrums. Skills that were newly acquired right before the baby's arrival, such as toilet training, are more likely to regress. The change in the mother-child relationship, with decreased attention and affection for the older child, is thought to be a primary reason for the increase in behavior problems.",

    "ground_truth_answer": "Tell-Show-Do is a classic technique to familiarize a child with dental procedures. First, the dentist will TELL the child what is going to be done using simple, age-appropriate words. Second, the dentist will SHOW the child what will be used, perhaps by demonstrating on a finger or a model. Third, the dentist will DO the procedure exactly as it was explained and demonstrated. This method helps remove the fear of the unknown and builds trust between the child and the dental team.",
